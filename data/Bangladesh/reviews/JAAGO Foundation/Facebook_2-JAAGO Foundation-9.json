I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work there, as it played a pivotal role in shaping my career path. JAAGO Foundation served as an essential stepping stone for me in my career journey, especially as I transitioned to my current position with an INGO. What sets JAAGO apart from other local NGOs is its unique blended culture. The organization seamlessly combines youthfulness and digital innovation, creating an environment unlike any other at same time respecting and learning from experience. One of the most remarkable aspects of JAAGO is the incredible room for personal and professional growth it provides. The organization not only encourages you to develop but also provides ample opportunities for experimentation. This supportive and empowering atmosphere enables individuals with a drive to make a positive change to thrive. If you are seeking a workplace that embodies a vibrant spirit, fosters digital innovation, and promotes personal growth, JAAGO Foundation is undoubtedly the best place to work. However, if you are someone who prefers to work alone or actively engages in office politics and gossips, JAAGO Foundation may not be the ideal place for you. The zero-tolerance policy towards workplace harassment showcases the organization's unwavering dedication to creating a safe and respectful environment for all. This extends to every employee, including office assistants, who are treated with utmost respect and dignity. In the dictionary of JAAGO Foundation, \"office politics\" is an unknown term, as the people here are incredibly straightforward. Even if someone attempts to engage in such practices, they seldom succeed.", "cons": "It is important to acknowledge that no organization, including JAAGO Foundation, is perfect. This recognition becomes particularly relevant for growing organizations like JAAGO.
