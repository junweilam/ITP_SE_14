The students at AUW are really what make the teaching experience. They are excited and enthusiastic about attending the school and their fellow students. It was amazing to watch how much the students grew during their years at the university.   The university offers housing and transport to international staff which is helpful.

The administration has had major challenges. There were three provosts in three years. The founder of the organization makes questionable decisions. In addition they stopped offering solid salaries to Access Academy teachers and now make them practically volunteer.  Chittagong is a challenging city to live in since there are few social outlets for new people to the city. The city feels more like a town with locals spending most of the time with family. There are a few cultural centers to meet new people and a few restaurants and bars. It's not Dhaka. There are no embassies or American clubs to go to. But it's also exciting to live in a city where you really have to create your own experiences and challenge yourself to explore.,0.9574517,0.040304944,0.002243393

The Young Professional Program allows you to get a first hand experience from multiple aspects. You get monthly/weekly attachments with different prgrams (microfinance health agriculture education enterprise etc). The learning process is very fast. You get a lot of filed experience. Moreover you get a mentor and an advisor (from the director board) this gives you an exposure on a completely new level. If you do good you will be given an opportunity for a foreign visit in BRAC international programs. Overall it is an unique experience and a stepping stone for your career.,0.0003166189,0.0012917392,0.99839157
The attachments to programs are all in rural remote areas. If you are not used to living outside dhaka it will be a challenge. The process flow of BRAC is tediously bureaucratic which turns annoying at some point or the other.,0.9985669,0.0012862962,0.000146736
No other organisation has the kind of reach and impact BRAC has. It reaches 130 million people with its Bangladesh operations and 8 million people through its global operations. BRAC teaches you how to operate at scale and always design programmes that will have the maximum impact on the end user. It also teaches you to constantly learn from the operations on the ground and continuously improve the service delivery quality.,0.92603886,0.06571467,0.008246541
It doesn't have a clear succession plan. The senior management is composed of individuals who have hardly worked in field operations. They will not be able to fill in Abed's shoes when the time comes.,0.9989285,0.00093983393,0.00013168763
 During my brief time with BRAC's Research and Evaluation Division I received great mentorship from my supervisor who encouraged his team to innovate and develop their own skills.  From senior management at the organisation the vision communication was clear and coherent.  The workplace was friendly and enabling a great place for employees of any gender but especially women as they had highly organised daycare facilities (for children up to 5 years old) onsite and flexible hour options.  Very progressive and conscious organisation at all levels  from the field to the boardroom.,0.00017560173,0.00019326032,0.99963117
 Slow upward mobility as promotions and salary increments depend on the availability of senior positions opening up  Limited opportunities to do lateral work across departments at entrylevel  Quality of experience varies highly depending on the flexibility of supervisors,0.99916315,0.0006868611,0.0001499528

Its a huge enterprise so you often have to rely on other entities owned by the organisation to do certain work for you. In some instances the entities you rely on aren't as passionate about the work as your colleagues are. They just don't get it. They just don't. You can't really blame them. I guess they have other work which they find are more valuable.,0.97276783,0.026959114,0.0002730615
The organisation provides a surprisingly flexible work environment in terms of trying out new things and learning from failures even after being so big.

The organisation has still to learn what real Product Management is and how to drive product development keeping ROI as a focal.

"JAAGO Foundation is an exceptional NGO that is rapidly growing in Bangladesh. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to work there as it played a pivotal role in shaping my career path. JAAGO Foundation served as an essential stepping stone for me in my career journey especially as I transitioned to my current position with an INGO. What sets JAAGO apart from other local NGOs is its unique blended culture. The organization seamlessly combines youthfulness and digital innovation creating an environment unlike any other at same time respecting and learning from experience. One of the most remarkable aspects of JAAGO is the incredible room for personal and professional growth it provides. The organization not only encourages you to develop but also provides ample opportunities for experimentation. This supportive and empowering atmosphere enables individuals with a drive to make a positive change to thrive. If you are seeking a workplace that embodies a vibrant spirit fosters digital innovation and promotes personal growth JAAGO Foundation is undoubtedly the best place to work. However if you are someone who prefers to work alone or actively engages in office politics and gossips JAAGO Foundation may not be the ideal place for you. The zerotolerance policy towards workplace harassment showcases the organization's unwavering dedication to creating a safe and respectful environment for all. This extends to every employee including office assistants who are treated with utmost respect and dignity. In the dictionary of JAAGO Foundation ""office politics"" is an unknown term as the people here are incredibly straightforward. Even if someone attempts to engage in such practices they seldom succeed.",0.0067025404,0.008128177,0.9851693
