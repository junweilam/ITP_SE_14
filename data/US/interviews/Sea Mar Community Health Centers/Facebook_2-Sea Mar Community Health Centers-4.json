The day of the meeting came, and they were 30 minutes late in starting it because they hadn't sent the video call link for microsoft teams, and their system required me to have a log-in set up - but the website on my browser redirected me to a new page and said I had to log-in through the access portal of an entirely different organization (not SeaMar). We ultimately erred for a phone call. They didn't take accountability for their mishandling of the meeting setup. No interview with SeaMar or any organization I have spoken with has allowed such a delay nor error to occur, and there was no professionalism here. They also didn't introduce the other admin staff present, got my name wrong, and asked me very few questions with no followup questions nor any information about next steps from the other staff. It was 10 minutes of talking, and then the interview was over. I got rejected the next day over email. SeaMar is an excellent organization.
