Application required 3 references, complete job/salary and education experience.  Four weeks after I applied (I actually applied for two positions in the same department), I received an email requesting a date and time for a phone interview regarding both positions. The call consisted of two team members of the department.  The phone interview required a walk through of a coding example (I was not able to access the internet at the time so we did it verbally).  After the sample, we discussed previous work experiences as related to coding and testing, the position and department, expectations, salary, and benefits.  I was told during the call that they wanted me back in for a second interview, and that someone would be in touch with me within the next couple of weeks.  I received another email two days later requesting an in person interview with the two team members I spoke with on the phone, the interview was set up for the following Tuesday (8 days after the phone interview).\r\n\r\nI was used to onsite interviews, this one was a little different.  I was in a room with the team members and was asked to code two samples in Java (routine examples).  They were straight forward, however I had more experience with hardware than software.  The difference between this interview and others was how the interviewers interacted with me.  I was talking my way through, bouncing ideas off of them, and received solid feedback on my ideas.  Usually in most interviews, I would get a stare or be told they couldn\u2019t help.  After the coding samples, there were \u201ctheoretical\u201d questions.  I was asked about examples on synchronization, programming limitations (hardware bound), and others.  Lastly, I was shown some of the projects the team currently, and previously, worked on.\r\n\r\nI was called the next day to be informed, that assuming all the paperwork went through and that my references were solid, I would be getting an official offer.

The day before my interview, after I turned in the design project for review, the department receptionist emailed me saying they were unsure of where the department was in the process. This was a mistake that shook me up quite a bit, especially since I put quite some work into my presentation. I was then informed that email was for someone else.\r\n\r\nA month after the interview, I reached out again to see where the process was. I was given such a vague answer and told to reach out to the personnel coordinator, who had a similar response. I received a letter of regret three months after the original job posting. When I reached out for direct feedback, the only response was that the department was going in a different direction. I again rephrased my question for direct feedback regarding the project, but the personnel coordinator did not respond or help me contact the correct person.

Application required 3 references, complete job/salary and education experience.  Four weeks after I applied (I actually applied for two positions in the same department), I received an email requesting a date and time for a phone interview regarding both positions. The call consisted of two team members of the department.  The phone interview required a walk through of a coding example (I was not able to access the internet at the time so we did it verbally).  After the sample, we discussed previous work experiences as related to coding and testing, the position and department, expectations, salary, and benefits.  I was told during the call that they wanted me back in for a second interview, and that someone would be in touch with me within the next couple of weeks.  I received another email two days later requesting an in person interview with the two team members I spoke with on the phone, the interview was set up for the following Tuesday (8 days after the phone interview).\r\n\r\nI was used to onsite interviews, this one was a little different.  I was in a room with the team members and was asked to code two samples in Java (routine examples).  They were straight forward, however I had more experience with hardware than software.  The difference between this interview and others was how the interviewers interacted with me.  I was talking my way through, bouncing ideas off of them, and received solid feedback on my ideas.  Usually in most interviews, I would get a stare or be told they couldn\u2019t help.  After the coding samples, there were \u201ctheoretical\u201d questions.  I was asked about examples on synchronization, programming limitations (hardware bound), and others.  Lastly, I was shown some of the projects the team currently, and previously, worked on.\r\n\r\nI was called the next day to be informed, that assuming all the paperwork went through and that my references were solid, I would be getting an official offer.
