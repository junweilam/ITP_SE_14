The phone screen was better than usual: the HR rep had a good understanding of the role and the team, so she was able to answer my questions. (That's often not the case.) The interview with the manager for the position went extremely well. It felt very conversational. The panel interview was a bit more formal, but still not particularly stressful.

I gave it an extra week after they told me (because things happen), then sent two inquiries (which I was invited to do). I eventually heard back about a month after the final interview was held (after assuming I'd been ghosted). Somewhat disappointing after the extensive interview process, but maybe the offer to the successful candidate was delayed or something. I would urge NRDC to work on providing timelier updates to candidates. One other disappointment: they had a lot of emphasis on DEI throughout the process, but when I asked in the final interview about what steps NRDC had taken organizationally to promote DEI, I got a fluffy non-answer.

(OK pandemic, but still!) Then I interviewed with the hiring manager, who seemed thoughtful and nice -- like someone who would be great to work with.  She talked more than she listened, but overall I was left with a favorable impression. \n\nI advanced to the next round, a panel interview with cross-team collaborators on programs and comms. They seemed like amazing colleagues and I began to get really excited to work at NRDC. Interview was well-scripted and well-run. Standard questions / no surprises. The recruiter called to confirm the salary range, which was a bit less than in my current role -- but I said I was flexible and reiterated my interest. \n\nI advanced to the final round, an interview with two leaders of the large national development team. Again, both seemed very smart, collegial, terrific. The first week of November, I learned that I was selected to receive the job offer. I clarified details of their remote work policy / COVID protocols, the superb benefits package, and start date with the recruiter. The hiring manager never communicated with me directly for some reason.\n\nWhen I got the salary offer a few days later, I countererd politely, requesting a very modest increase (literally, $2K). I was gobsmacked when, absent any further communciation, they revoked the offer! There is no chance I lied on my CV or that they got a bad reference (come to think of it, they never even checked references. The recruiter said they didn't think they could meet my needs, that they were surprised that salary was \"an issue\" -- it wasn't -- and that I didn't have an offer in writing so legally it was \"fine\" for them to change their minds. They could have at least done me the courtesy of dialogue -- I would have accepted the original offer if they had just said no to my increase request -- but instead their abrupt reversal left me feeling confused, disappointed, and like we had all wasted so much time for what?\n\nI would like to think that something got lost in translation with the recruiter, who perhaps did not do her best work at communicating between the hiring manager and me -- and not that NRDC doesn't think that women can and should negotiate without retribution. Or that women who ask for what we need for our careers and our families is \"an issue\"! \n\nI have always thought of NRDC as an effective organization and a progressive workplace, so I was genuinely shocked at this outcome.

The phone screening isn't hard, it's a few generic questions to gauge whether you can do the work. The panel interview was pretty informal, they just skimmed through my resume and asked me questions about things that jumped out at them. They didn't seem very prepared. The final interview was also pretty informal, and I don't know if it's because that's just the supervisor's personality, or because he didn't take me seriously as a candidate. He asked more questions about my ability to do the job, and gauged whether I would be a good fit with the team. He was very candid and said that program assistants usually stay in the position for 2-3 years and then move on because it is rare and difficult to move up within the org. I was told they would make a hiring decision after two weeks, and then never heard anything.

I met with 5 different people in the company and it lasted over two hours. They seemed really impressed by my resume and gave me a timeline for when they would contact me (they said they would let all candidates know either way if they got the job). That day came with no call, so I contacted the company. They told me they were behind and should have an answer by the end of the week. I called after the weekend with no response. I have not heard back. I was very unimpressed by how this was handled. To go through a lengthy interview process and no one has the courtesy or respect to call you. The job was not going to offer much - they made it clear you could not move up in the company and the pay was likely very little.

I had a good answer, but after a company tells you that there is no room to move up and most people work only 2-3 years as a program assistant and then move out of the company or go back to school, it's hard to find an answer in line with that type of attitude.
