This interview was very basic and asked questions about past work experience. The second interview was virtual with three managers from the county I would be working in. They asked many detailed questions about past situations that related to the job. Many of the questions were a bit difficult to answer since I am a recent graduate and do not have case worker expeirence. The job description specifically stated new graduates were encouraged to apply. I really enjoyed the managers who interviewed me and felt like the position would be a great fit. Unfortuntely, I was not informed until the last 5 minutes of the interview that position was actually available and they were creating a queue of eligible applicants. They explained they are hoping to expand in 6-9 months and wanted to have candidates who have already been through the interview process ready for when the time came. While this isn't inherently an issue, I found it dishonest they did not tell me until the very end of the second interview. Due to the lack of an immediately/soon available position, I chose to remove myself from consideration for the position. I felt lied to and felt this dishonestly was a glimpse into how the organization is run.", "Interview Questions": "Provide an example of a time where you had to gather various people together and conducted a meeting as an advocate for someone else."}, {"date": "24 Jul 2021", "title": "Service Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Service Coordination in Jun 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "There is a phone interview first, it only last for about 30 mins they just going through your experiences.

I applied, spent two weeks following up with emails and calls, and then set up a phone interview with a person for H.R. She was very sweet and helpful in answering my questions. I was then sent two tests, one was a scale personality test with questions such as \"do you feel you often think outside the box: Not at all, to very much. Then a second SAT type test, with questions like \"a large body of water: A, R, P, L\". I passed through to the final interview, expecting a one-on-one session. However, there were 3 women, all very lovely. This interview was broken up into 3 parts, the first was questions about me. I was expecting the normal \"what skills do you believe would be a good fit for our company\" however they were not. There were 12-15 questions, all of which were \"can you tell me about a time\". I expected a couple of those, but 12-15 was a lot, as someone who doesnt have the greatest memory, it was very challenging, but I was honest and believed I did well. I was applying for a position using ASL, and was unexpectedly asked to sign with one of the women, which threw me off since I wasn't told I would have to sign, but I believe I did well. In the second part of the interview, I was sat in a room with a computer, instructed to do a mock case report on a fictional client who was having issues with his parent moving into a retirement home. As I do not have previous case management work experience and did not understand the position/requirements well enough, I wasn't quite sure how to go about this. For the third part of the interview, I was able to ask questions I had regarding the job (of which I had many). Overall the process took 1.5 hours, the women were very sweet but I would say the interview was extremely difficult.", "Interview Questions": "-Can you tell me about a time where you struggled with laws or regulations \r\n-Can you tell me about a time you had difficulties meeting the demands of a client/individual\r\n-Can you tell me about a time you had to be organized\r\n-Can you tell me about a time in which you had to advocate for an individual \r\n"}], [{"date": "29 Jun 2016", "title": "Service Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Service Coordination", "Interview Descriptions": "Seemed overkill with phone interview that was an hour then had a interview in bmore with 4 women that were not very welcoming.
