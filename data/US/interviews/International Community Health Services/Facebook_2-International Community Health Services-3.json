I figured the first time this happened was a fluke, but the same issue occurred so its worth giving feedback. This is the only FQHC I have ever interviewed at, for Director-level positions, that ghosts candidates post-interview. I truly have never experienced this anywhere else. Ghosting candidates is, in general, not ideal, but tends to happen with entry-level positions with a high volume applicants and interviews. But to ghost candidates for Director-level positions where you may run into those people in this not-so-small field of community health?
