I did not get that position, but was later told how well I did in the interview, and to please interview again for other positions. (blessing in disguise when I didn't get that job) I think outside applicants have an edge with many of the positions posted but some of our salaries are just too low for some to consider. (I am at the maxed out level for pay and only get COLA. Newer employees have less benefits compensation, therefore less costly to the hospital. If you look online at the salary listings one sight has posted for county employees, the numbers are deceiving. Many nurse salaries on that site are $90,000-100,000, but these nurses work lots of overtime. It is the same for many other county employees listed there) \r\nThe typical questions were asked, why do you want this job, what can you bring to the position, how would you handle xxx situation\u2026Maybe I knew what answers were expected.\r\nThe work culture is somewhat tense because of the financial situation, but generally a good, fair, friendly work environment. Of course there are exceptions, but I really believe it is the best hospital in Las Vegas for work environment, support of staff, consistency, acceptance and tolerance.", "Interview Questions": "How do you handle the situation of being asked to work with someone you do not like (or does not like you) or do not get along with?"}]]
