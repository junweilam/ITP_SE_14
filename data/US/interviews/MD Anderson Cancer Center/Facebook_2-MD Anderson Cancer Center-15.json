I had a brief chat with the hiring manager to ensure there was a preliminary \u201cfit\u201d and was then told I would be contacted by HR to schedule an in-person interview. Later that day I was contacted and given 2 options for an interview. I was given a time to arrive to HR first where I would meet with them, and then be sent for the interview. Upon meeting with HR I was told my salary requirement was likely higher than they were planning to pay (even though it was within the range listed) and asked to supply a minimum required amount. I then went to meet with the hiring manager where I waited 45 minutes to be seen. Once seen I was informed that HR had me come too early, and that they weren\u2019t scheduled to see me until 45 minutes after I arrived. I met with two individuals with whom I would work, spending a total of 3 hours at MDA. The interview seemed to go very well and I was contacted a few days later with a request to come for a second, panel interview the following week; no options were given for date/time. For the panel interview I had to again go to HR first to check in and then shuttle over to the other building. My appointment time was appropriate for this round and the hiring manager escorted me to a room to meet with other staff. This interview was relatively short, at most 30 minutes, but I thought it went really well. Prior to that interview, I was told that depending on how that interview went, they might arrange for me to come back for one more interview to meet with faculty members, but they may not if arranging it was too difficult (they attempted to get one to attend that day but none could). It has now been 3 weeks and I have received no contact or feedback from HR or the hiring manager. I emailed the HR rep 10 days after the second interview to inquire about the status and to relay my continued interest but received no response. I was not supplied with contact info for the hiring manager to inquire directly. I have since seen the position newly posted on different job sites and have assumed that I was not selected.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: a day after posting this review I was contacted  by HR and asked to come for another interview (3 weeks after my last interview with no contact between).

After reviewing my application, the HR people email asking few questions like\u201d why are you interested in working in MD Anderson and what are the salary expectation\u201d. It is known that the salary ranges for MD Anderson employees (including pharmacy techs) are posted online to help give an idea about salary expectations. So, I asked initially for the mid range (considering that I have a higher education degree, a 1+ year experience as a CPhT, and a strong pharmacy background from being a pharmacist overseas for 6 years). However, the HR did not take these in consideration and offered me a low range salary, which ultimately I agreed on. \r\nThen it comes to the interview process, which I describe as totally unprofessional and unrespectful at all. They gave me a confirmation letter for an interview that I printed before going there. When I arrived to the HR building, I notified the lady at the front desk but it seemed that she had no idea about my name or anything regarding having an interview with me. I showed her the copy of the confirmation email but she was still confused like nobody told her what was going on. She told me to have a seat till someone from the HR will meet me. I waited for 15 minutes, then a lady from the dept showed up and gave me a map about how to take the the shuttle to go the building where the assistant hiring manager is. So, I took the shuttle and went there. I arrived to the pharmacy at 10 am, which is my interview time, and waited for another 15 minutes until 2 young ladies came and asked me how do I pronounce my name!! They told me to follow them without introducing themselves. I thought that they\u2019re probably employees and would take me to the assistant hiring manager. However, we sat in a lounge like a food court. I asked them about their name and that they did not introduce themselves. They laughed like it was a joke and one of them told me that she is the assistant hiring manager!. After that, they pulled out a few pages describing the position that I applied to, and they started reading out these things to me like I was in elementary school! \r\nThey went over my CV and they said it\u2019s a pretty good one though they don\u2019t require experience in the positions that I applied to but (they would prefer someone who worked in CVS or Walmart, which is not my case !!). I was like then why you guys called me for this interview! You could save time for both of us if I was informed earlier!!\r\nNext they start asking me questions that I felt off subject like \u201cduring my work as a technician, was there an incident/mistake that I made and apologized for it!\u201d and \u201chave I been in a situation where I needed advice or help from more than 2 sources at the same time?\u201d .\r\nThe interview lasted for 30 minutes, and at the end they offered me a tour inside the pharmacy with one of the techs. I was also told to go back to the HR building because they wanted to interview me there.\r\n I went back to the HR building and told the lady in the front desk that I\u2019m supposed to be interviewed with somebody in the HR. She told me to have a seat and someone will be with me shortly. However, I waited for 45 minutes without anybody showing up. I really got frustrated by the way the treated me and asked the receptionist to check what is the issue. Few minutes later, a lady showed up saying that she\u2019s sorry but the person who was supposed to interview me is in a meeting now, and she would call me later on that day or the next day (which did not happen)! After being on hold for over than a month waiting for any update regarding my application, they sent me an email finally saying that they didn\u2019t consider me for the two positions I applied to!\r\nTo sum up, the experience that I had with these people showing that they are not professional, not respectful and not considerate.

D. Anderson is very big on personality assessments. I, on the other hand, am not a fan of them. They asked questions that were offensive to me and had no relation whatsoever to the job. Why should an academic department care if I would like to try scuba diving or whether I felt unloved by my parents as a child? It's none of their business! I have a real problem with psychological testing, obviously. Why is that? It's because I do not like people peering into my brain and drawing conclusions, not telling me what those conclusions are, then basing an employment decision on those conclusions.  It would be only fair for them to discuss those conclusions with me and give me a chance to say, \"Yes, that's right,\" \"No, that's wrong,\" or \"Yes, that used to be true of me, but here is how I have addressed it/ grown from the experience.\" Though this practice is legal, I think it is unethical. Ask yourself if you want to submit to this type of examination and live with the outcome.\r\n\r\nAside from the psychological assessments, the other tests and interviews were easy, and I felt completely at ease completing them. I do not feel that the interviewers' questions were particularly insightful or probing.\r\n\r\nNow, six weeks after the interviews and tests, I have yet to hear back from M. D. Anderson. I sent a thank-you note and a follow-up inquiry. After all that effort on my part, they did not have the courtesy to respond with a \"thanks but no thanks\" letter.
