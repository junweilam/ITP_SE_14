I began interviewing in early July.  I was advanced to a second interview in late July.  I was then asked to complete a test assignment, after which I was invited to a third round of interviews, meeting an additional three people in late August.  Then they 'ghosted' me.   I was never made aware they made a hiring decision and when I reached out via email to inquire whether they had made a hiring decision, my email went unanswered two weeks before I received an abrupt response that a decision was made \"some time ago,\" and someone should have contacted me.   \n\nI check my spam folder routinely and received every other communication from them, except the email informing me that they decided to go with another candidate.  This is one of the reasons why candidates distrust test assignments.  They wasted several hours of my time having me meet with 6 different people at 45 minutes each, not including the time spent on the test assignment and then never had the decency to inform me that they decided to go with someone else.   \nEveryone I met was very nice and it was extremely disappointing that the process I experienced was so disorganized and dysfunctional.\n\nWhen I asked for feedback, I was told that everyone was very impressed by my interviews and credentials, but the consensus was the role might be \"too junior for me.\"  Throughout each of the interviews and even in submitting the test assignment, I was constantly told that this was \"a highly visible\" (and newly created) role that would be reporting to the Chief Diversity Officer as well as Senior Leadership of the Enterprise.   I'm not sure why I would have gone through such a lengthy interview process for a role they apparently thought I might be overqualified for.  During my very first interview when salary was discussed, I was told very confidently that they were \"quite comfortable\" with my requested range and even the tone the interviewer used implied that I might have been asking too low.  I was even emailed benefits information the same day to persuade me on why I should consider them as a prospective employer.   I truly wish them well.
