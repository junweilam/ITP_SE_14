I scheduled a time for a 1st round phone interview. I scheduled the interview for the following week with a gentleman named Marquise. The interview questions were pretty routine and fitting for the position, until suddenly the call dropped. I'm not sure if the interviewer was bored with my answers or what, but I had to return the call to his number that went straight to voicemail. I left a message and (surprisingly) the interviewer called back about half an hour later. He had no answer for why the phone disconnected. He asked a couple more questions and told me I would advance in the process and to wait for a call the following week for further instructions. That call never came. I called the interviewer again to see if there was a change in plans for the training class. I left two voice messages but never received a return call. After being told I would advance to the next step, the interviewer ghosted me. This act was very unprofessional and left an extremely bad taste in my mouth for U of P. It's hard to believe that a reputable institution would hire immature clowns to be responsible for something as important as recruiting new talent. Playing games with people and being less than forthright with people that take your word seriously has no place in an organization that is supposed to operate with some level of integrity.

Some places I had previously interviewed were very rushed and seemed more about just trying to fill in empty seats so I declined. We went over my resume, experience, and was asked 5 questions. I was a little hesitant at first since my last remote experience was not too good, but because the overall process was very organized, professional, and transparent I decided to accept the job offer that I received a few days later.

Nowadays, you have to submit your resume' to corporate office and this may take a very long time as, to my knowledge, they receive  hundreds of resumes' of candidates. Nevertheless, UOPX has many campuses that hire and keep a pipeline of candidates for management position/s. The reason being is employee turnover (i.e promotion, termination, lateral movement, demotion etc.,.). For your resume' to stand out, it has to be up-to-date, clear, formatted accordingly, with catchy personal statement, and definitely consisting of truthfully stellar and relevant work experience. If you make it to the initial interview, you have to be at least 15 minutes early, and will be asked with mostly situational questions to uncover your true behavior, outlook, personality, and intelligence. Usually, you will meet with at least 2 interviewers in management positions, and if they end up liking you, then you will highly likely proceed to another interview (with upper management), and perhaps a presentation, unless there is another qualified candidate who seemed to have astounded them more than you did. Depending on the campus and the type of management position (upper, middle, high) will also determine how many phases of interview you will have. They are very subjective also--so make sure you appear in your best interview attire, smile, confidence, and great tone/energy. Managers are expected to be motivating, energetic, and approachable, so ask people around you to rate your ability to motivate others, your friendliness, and your energy, so you can make the necessary adjustment before showing up for the interview. I say all these things because I, along with my peers, did most, if not all, of the interviews at my old UOPX Campus and we had come across so many highly-credentialed candidates that we did not consider for the position because they were either arrogant, boring, deficient of confidence, or simply improperly dressed.", "Interview Questions": "The questions really are not technical. Questions are more creative and requires nothing but common sense, critical thinking, and personal approach on how one address an issue to an employee, how one deescalate a situation, how one motivates an employee to be productive in a deadline-sensitive environment, what recommendations you would give someone who is already doing superb, and how you assist someone under-performing to exceed expectations, just to name a few. Every one has a different approach, mentality, and it all depends on how you present yourself in answering these questions.  The questions are related to customer service and employee management particularly. It is all about your soft skills, because you got called for an interview assuming you already have the hard credentials in place (degree, experience in an academic institution, hardware and software skills).

Firstly, I was recruited. I did not directly apply for this position. And I know this is primarily an online university, but at some point, things should be taken OFF-line and a meeting should be held. Especially when one resides in the same city as the position listed.\r\n\r\nFirst I had to take a pretty lengthy three-part test through an online program. Before anyone has even spoken to me, I had to take some convoluted and time-consuming tests.\r\n\r\nThe kicker was the phone screening that followed that:\r\n\r\n1) My interviewer called me 20 minutes late. This was particularly upsetting considering I am currently employed and did the interview during my lunch break.\r\n\r\n2) She didn't know jack about me. She didn't even have my resume, so I had to verbally dictate my entire resume to her, which was another complete waste of 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n3) She couldn't answer ONE of my questions regarding the position. Not a single one. I had a list of questions but gave up after she said \"I don't know\" to four of them.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the girl I interviewed with was new, but it was extremely inconsiderate and unprofessional. I've taken your silly online tests and passed, you've sent me documents asking me to sign my life away without any kind of room for negotiation and I've hesitantly done so, THE LEAST you could do is send me an interviewer who is educated regarding my experiences and that can answer my questions so I can determine whether I truly want to pursue this experience or not. Interviews are a two-way street.\r\n\r\nThe one question she DID answer was whether the next round of interviews would finally be in-person, to which she said no. It would be yet another phone interview. \r\n\r\nOH! And she accidentally called my number again an hour later asking for what I presume to be the next interview candidate.

He called about 30min late, again very much in a hurry (presumably because he was running late).  \r\n\r\nThe phone interview was very standard.  \r\nThese were questions like:\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to leave your current job?\u201d  \r\n\u201cWhy are you interested in UoP?\u201d\r\n\u201cGive an example of a time you had quotas to meet?\u201d\r\n\u201cGive me an example of a time you failed to reach your expected numbers?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe questions were clearly preset, and read off of a script.

The interview started out well, and I answered all usual interview questions well. One of the associate directors did ask me 2 illegal questions indirectly and in a sneaky way. Question was, \"Do you have family around here?\" and towards the end he asked me \"what is your background, meaning where are you from?\". I did answer both questions truthfully.\r\n                              The question that really bothered me and was irrelavant to the position was one of the directors said \"I am going to ask you a very silly question\" and here is the scneraio \"You own a rainbow shop and I (Director) am looking to buy a rainbow, sell me a rainbow?\". While I started answering the questions by asking the director questions like, why does he need a rainbow?, and what would he do with it?, what colors does you like?, etc., the panel just didn't seem satisfied and kept repeating the question over and over. Seems like they wanted to hear a specific answer from me for a totally abstract and irrelevant interview question, which they were not getting. \r\n                                    I have 13+  years of retail sales experience, and fully understand how engage people in a coversation and find out their needs and untimately sell them, however I believe this panel was too fond of asking a silly question and then kept repeating it to get a predetermined answer.

The next morning I interviewed with a really nice lady in HR and I felt bad because I had to bring my suitcase with me because I was leaving to the airport right afterwards and I had been having a taxi take me everywhere.  I felt it was unprofessional of me, but I had no choice and the HR lady was super nice about it.  I don't recall any questions she asked since it was so long ago, but nothing stands out in my mind as difficult or caught me off guard.  After the interview she said she would send me an email with some \"test\" questions.  They were basically questions on how you would respond to an email from a student based on certain situations.

Five managers where there and they observed \u00e2?\u00a6and two of them took notes.  Sorry to say but one white manager who was taking notes demonstrated nonverbal redneck attitude and would constantly look at us with ignorant look.  Few of the mangers were hinting to the manger who was taking note by nodding yes or no by shaking their heads it was so obvious and embarrassing to watch them do that one female manager was standing right front of us was also using her eye movement and head nodding to express who could be a potential candidate.  I think they were not very professional. Then one of the managers would pretend to be someone visiting Uni of Phoenix and asked each of us to take turn playing the role of an enrollment counselor.  Next  they gave a paper with ten variables, motivation, leadership, communication, nonverbal communication, success record,  information on University of Phoenix....we were asked to prioritize the list from 1-10...(1 most important 10 the least important.  Then we were grouped five in each group and were asked to rank the same variables as a group.  They picked a few people to give answer to why they chose certain variable to be more important.  Later they told us that there was no right answer which I figured it out but my team members did not agree and I did not push them.  Later they showed a presentation of University of phoenix and the role of an enrollment counselor which is telemarketing and gave a five minute break and asked those not interested to leave.  Later they asked everyone to go in a room and wait for individual interview.  They had a camera and were observing us for behavioral analysis.  Later they asked me to come and took me to the room where all the managers were and the Manager who was taking notes told me in a very short manner oh we did not want to tell front of the rest of the people that there is no interview today and we will call you.

Some reviews on other sites have classified interviewing with University of Phoenix as a \"part time job\" and this is very true. I first had a phone interview with a recruiter from out-of-state (a weird area code came up on my phone, so I didn't answer right away). It took the recruiter 5 hours to call me back once I left a return voicemail. The phone interview was not an easy one. Usually, phone interviews just ask you about your last job, education, etc but this one asked questions that required more detailed answers. \"so why do you want to be an Enrollment Counselor?\" \"What do supervisors do to motivate you?\" \"What are your professional goals?\" \"How would you deal with a negative situation?\" etc.\r\nI was scheduled the next day to go in to meet with the supervisor.\r\n\r\nI had a one-on-one interview in a tiny conference room (sitting across a very small table from the interviewer). The interview was over an hour long. The interviewer asked many of the same types of questions as the phone interview. They are those types of questions where you could be \"stumped\" really easily if you are nervous. If you're good at verbalizing and talking your way through things, you should be fine. But, if you tend to be shy or nervous you may want to practice beforehand...a lot.\r\n\r\nI was scheduled the next day for a phone interview role play session with the interviewer/supervisor. The interviewer plays a student (an outgoing/eager one and then a shy/reluctant one). You have to pretend (awkwardly so) that the interviewer is, in fact, a student and you have to sell them on UofP. It is really hard. This is the make or break part of the interview, clearly. My approach was to keep everything positive and to ask the \"student\" lots of questions and it seemed to work well. However, it is difficult to do this knowing full well you do not know the \"Phoenix Way\" and could sound like a complete moron in front of your potiental boss. This process took about 30 mins. I had to do each scenario twice. Once, \"cold\" not knowing anything about the situation. The second time was after the interviewer/supervisor complemented me on things I said/did right and corrected things I said/did wrong. The interviewer asks you to correct specific mistakes in the second exchange with the \"student\". This, to me, was challenging to do with no preparation and not knowing how I am expected to do things. I guess that's the point.\r\n\r\nI was told I could get a follow up call about the next stage(s) in the process.\r\n\r\nThese involve a second interview, this time with higher management. Also, an extensive background check (credit, school, criminal, traffic, employment) which I was told could take weeks.\r\n\r\nThe interview process is very, very extensive for what is an entry-level job.", "Interview Questions": "What are some ways you have experienced a supervisor not deal with things correctly?"}, {"date": "19 Sept 2013", "title": "Enrollment Advisor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at University of Phoenix in Jul 2009", "Interview Descriptions": "very straightforward, phone interview then a week later face to face interview with management", "Interview Questions": "how did you use your business savvy in a difficult situation"}, {"date": "7 Jul 2009", "title": "Enrollment Counselor Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at University of Phoenix in Jul 2009", "Interview Descriptions": "There were two phone calls, they each consisted of 10 minutes of questions that I thought were very valid and benficial to the job description.
