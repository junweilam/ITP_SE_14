After I interviewed with the PCU interim director, the recruiter called back to offer the job. At this time, I was still finishing my nursing program so I was not yet licensed. They were unable to tell me anything about salary, benefits, or relocation assistance pre-license, so I was unable to accept the job. I followed back up with an email to the recruiter stating that I decided to decline the job offer. They wouldn't take no for an answer.
