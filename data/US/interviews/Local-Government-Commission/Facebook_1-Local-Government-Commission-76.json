The interview lasted approximately an hour. After this virtual interview I was offered a second in-person interview where I was told I would interview with additional people, complete an exercise where I respond to scenarios that a person in the position would face, and make a presentation. I prepared a presentation and sent it in prior to the interview as requested.

I feel as though they should have been upfront about this in the initial interview. I could have saved my time as I would have declined the second interview if there was uncertainty with the position/organization.", "Interview Questions": "Questions were related to the functions of the job (i.e. what is your experience with managing staff?\")."}, {"date": "15 Aug 2016", "title": "CivicSpark AmeriCorps Fellow Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Local Government Commission in Aug 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "The first step is a screening interview by phone, followed by a more in-depth interview.
