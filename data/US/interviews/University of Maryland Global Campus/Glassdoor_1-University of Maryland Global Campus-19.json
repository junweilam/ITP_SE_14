I'm a grown adult and I think I can handle pretty much anything at this point in my life, so unless the applicant must learn to rise at 5am with the bugle then I saw no point to this issue. \r\n\r\nThe remainder of the interview didn't go much better. I use the word \"interview\" loosely, as a successful interview is supposed to be a discussion, not a \"game show\" -style question and answer, which is what this was. They each had their printed out list of generic questions which they read word for word, and each time after I answered they had zero follow up comments which might have drove it towards more of a discussion.
