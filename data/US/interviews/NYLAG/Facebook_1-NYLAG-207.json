I've never been grilled with questions in an interview, but that's what happened here. The asked me a series of similar questions with no follow-up questions nor did they engage with anything I said. There were about 6 people in my interview, which was odd because only one person spoke. I've worked for legal nonprofits before, so I'm wary of the burnout you can get from working for one. I asked them what they did to prevent burnout in their employees and they had no response, which is a red flag for me. The entire interview lasted about half an hour and there was only one round, which is also a red flag for me since I feel like you need more than that to make a good staffing decision. Also, they never got back to me after the interview.", "Interview Questions": "Why NYLAG? Why this specific department? How do you keep organized?

Relatively disorganized process I would say though as they wanted to interview me the next day and I didn't get a confirmed date and time until the day of the interview. It was ok, they used an interview script so it was hard to build much of a connection with the interviewer. Sent a thank you the next day and received a second interview request for the following week. I confirmed and didn't hear anything back. The day of the second interview no one showed up at the specified time.  I emailed them and got a short apology the next day and was  offered a new time the following week. This interview only lasted ten minutes as it seemed the attorney was in a rush to go to a court hearing. Wasn't able to ask any questions. I sent a thank you letter the next day and a follow up email the next week asking where they were at and never received any response. I would expect some kind of communication letting me know I wasn't selected considering I interviewed twice.  \r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if they are the type organization to contact old applicants months later when their new hires quit. They made reference to two \r\nof their paralegals quitting abruptly and it seemed like they felt it was unprofessional and were disappointed. But now I am wondering if it is the disorganized office culture and poor communication practices of the organization that is to blame.
