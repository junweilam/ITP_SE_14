They added a lot of unnecessary details that would have been more appropriate for a second or final interview, like getting free lunch sometimes, etc. It felt like they were hesitating to tell me something. They then proceed to tell me what the salary for the position will be because it wasn't listed in the initial job posting. The figure they gave me was the lowest number I had heard since starting my job search. At that point I had applied to ~20 other places and was generally seeing salaries that were at least $10k higher.

Thursday rolls around and I am questioning why no one has informed me yet of the time of the interview. I decide on Thursday afternoon after not receiving an email to send an email myself. I stated how I had not received a time yet and how I felt scheduling an interview for tomorrow was too short notice for me. I also said they should notify me if they are no longer interested in interviewing me. Friday comes and goes with no communication. Days pass by and I no longer expect a reply back. After a whole seven days of no communication I receive an email. The person apologizes, says my emails were \"caught in (her) junk folder\", and she is still interested in interviewing me. I don't believe emails just end up unwillingly in junk folders but alas I decide to reply back my availability for the following week for an interview. We decide on Tuesday of the following week giving me enough time to prepare. At the designated time of the interview I await the interviewer to call my cell phone as they stated they would do. A few minutes pass by after the scheduled start time and I double check our emails to make sure I was not supposed to call them. Soon a few minutes turn into ten minutes and then twenty minutes.

She also said in a snotty tone I would be working w/people who had doctorates and such, as if to say I'd be working with people who were much smarter than me.\r\n\r\nShe told me they would be contacting people for a face to face the following week and having them come in the week after that and wanted someone to start immediately the beginning of February.

I also said they should notify me if they are no longer interested in interviewing me. Friday comes and goes with no communication. Days pass by and I no longer expect a reply back. After a whole seven days of no communication I receive an email. The person apologizes, says my emails were \"caught in (her) junk folder\", and she is still interested in interviewing me. I don't believe emails just end up unwillingly in junk folders but alas I decide to reply back my availability for the following week for an interview.
