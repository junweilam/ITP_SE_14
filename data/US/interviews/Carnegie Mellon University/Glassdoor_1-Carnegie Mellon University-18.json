Instead of the interviewer asking questions, I was the one who was asking more questions and kept the conversation alive for some time.\n\nThen no word from them for 2 months and then again got call for the next round which was a paired interview. They literally told me due to their seniors on vacation they were on hold. \nThe interview was 1:30 minutes where they asked a ton of hypothetical questions from robotics background system, including navigation, path planning and more.

Several zoom interviews later was called for an onsite interview. Didn't get a reimbursement for the travel expenses (see update). This whole process took 5 months. Interviewers were absolutely condescending. I wanted to leave half way into the process. I guess this is what happens when you have a bunch of old incompetent geezers and insecure people. I personally felt like they were looking for more of a cultural fit than your qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe first interviewer was nice, showed me around campus (which is in an abandoned pipe factory). This guy wants to leave badly. You can see it by his attitude. He told me in the first interview how he had to beg the director for several years to let him take classes at CMU while working there. He also interviewed at least one company while employed at NREC.\r\n\r\nThe second interviewers were also nice.\r\n\r\nIn the third round of interviews I literally had one lady (senior engineering manager) who was frowning the whole time, and another guy (robotics engineer) who constantly felt the need to assert his dominance (usually a sign of insecurity). The lady started off by bragging about how she was a nuclear engineer and such, and was condescending throughout the entire process. It felt like she already had someone else in mind and was trying to promote that person by playing political games. She spent the majority of the time down valuing my experience and qualifications. Since these are paired interviews, if one person gives off a negative impression that automatically imprints on the other. This is how broken their process is. Then again, should not be unexpected given the delusional nature of the director (keep reading).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is during interviews where people are supposed to be on their best behavior. I would hate to imaging what they are like outside of interview setting. Actually, now that I think about it, I did have one guy - a former interviewer - come into lunch and sit secluded from the rest of the team. If you ask me, I'd say that he hates the rest of the team. Can't imagine why.\r\n\r\nOverall most of the people came across as closed and narrow minded. I should also mention that these people first conducted a reference check before even deciding to interview me in-person. This is extremely disrespectful and a waste of time for my references who are researchers and principal software engineers. Reference burnout is a thing. My advice to the people interviewing at this place would be to get first a written offer contingent on reference and background checks, and then give these people the reference list.\r\n\r\nInterview with the director started off with saying how they can't afford 80k for someone who would be doing the job of software engineering, data engineering and ML engineering. To top it off he said that they don't like people who leave for better opportunities while the entire time dangling the carrot of getting to take classes at CMU. Not sure if the guy is delusional or too far detached from reality or both.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview I withdrew all of my applications for this place. The recruiter still sent me an email telling me that I had not been selected to move forward.\r\n\r\nWhat a joke of an organization. This place likes to dangle the carrot of getting to take classes at CMU while paying you significantly less than market value - 120,000 national average for ML engineers. The director did this to me several times. I guess this is the only way they can get candidates to apply and take the offer.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Several emails exchanges later I got the reimbursement after 2 months.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I recently accepted a position at a semicondictor industry as a Machine Learning Engineer with a base salary of $180000 (I asked for 130-140K), $10000 sign on bonus, and $25000 RSU with a vesting period of 1 year", "Interview Questions": "Reverse the string\r\nSeveral ML questions - what is bias and variance, what is the difference between classification and regression, What is the effect on the output feature maps of the convolution layer that follows a max pooling layer. Why do we want a maxpooling layer. When to use a confusion matrix. What is the difference between precision, recall and F1. what is focal loss, what is dice loss.\r\n\r\nML System Design (Facial recognition system) - think about clustering, dimensionality reduction, database storage, approximate nearest neighbor search, reducing database lookup time with horizontal scaling. Also think about feature/concept drift detection and rectification. Talk briefly about knowledge distillation, model quantization and pruning.\r\n\r\nData engineering question - how would you remove duplicate images? Hash the images using a fingerprinting algorithm using DFT. Similar to how shazam's audio fingerprinting works. Now you have reduced the problem to removing duplicate fingerprints. If you type \"image hashing\" in google, a lot of academic papers with noise robust algorithms will pop up."}, {"date": "10 Apr 2022", "title": "Undergraduate Research Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Carnegie Mellon University", "Interview Descriptions": "Meeting with PhD student, questions about resume, general knowledge questions.
