It took about a month. The biggest problem is not that they didn't pick me. It is that they wasted my time with the 3rd interview. There is a huge disconnect between the hiring manager/recruiter and the panel of three for the 3rd interview. The reason I wasn't hired was that I wasn't technical enough according to the recruiter. Well. the problem with that is the panel of 3 asked me a total of two technical questions and one of the three didn't ask me a single question. I gave the correct answer for one of the technical questions and a decent answer for the other. They mainly asked questions about my experience and my opinion on working with people. I wondered why it was such an easy interview. The problem is I never had a chance with the panel of three. They obviously were just going through the motions. They had a completely different view of my qualifications than the hiring manager and recruiter. This position has been open for 5 months. It is obvious that the recruiter and hiring manager have not worked  \n through guidelines or the process with the panel. Which they give a blanket veto to. I don't understand why they just don't allow the panel to just say someone is not qualified by looking at their resume. Instead of wasting people's time with a third interview. Since they put no guidelines on panel for the third interview. Anybody reading this who decide to interview with IT there, should be aware of their process and lack of consideration of people's time.
