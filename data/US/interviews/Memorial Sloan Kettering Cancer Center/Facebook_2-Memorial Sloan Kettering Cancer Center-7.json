The proctors were late to my first interview so we had to reschedule. The first interview occurred in September and (when it finally happened after rescheduling twice) was fine. It was just a preliminary check up to see my interest and if I was well qualified. The second interview didn't happen until January and that was after I kept emailing the Talent Acquisition Specialist about the details of the second interview which I was told would happen before winter break would start.  That did not happen of course. I was emailed over winter break if I would be available to come in on a Thursday to interview at an office location. I had booked my plane tickets for winter break in October so I was nowhere near NYC for any of these available time slots so I asked for accommodations. My second interview was with a Clinical Research Supervisor. The questions were more focused on my qualifications and skills and scenario questions to see how I would fit in the working environment. I really enjoyed this interview and the CRS. She answered a lot of my questions and gave me a better perspective of the job  and the company.  She recommended me for a third interview right away. I waited months just to hear about a third interview. And when I did, the Talent Acquisition Specialist told me that he apologized for the inconvenience but the department that I wanted to work with had been irresponsible in setting up their interviews and that I would be interviewed as soon as possible. This is now spring break (mid-March). Finally, when I did have an interview with the CRS of the department I wanted to work in,  there were audio problems AND apparently they had changed the job description from when I first interviewed in September. This was a shock to me and the new position wasn't as great of a fit. After this 6-month interview process, it took them 2 days to make a decision about me. The rejection email came from an automated server which was an even bigger kick to the gut. I understand that this is a well-reputable company but this was no way to treat a potential candidate. There was no organization and the timeline was just ridiculous. I found out a month later that the Talent Acquisition Specialist I had personally worked with had left the company so i have no idea of knowing whether my experience is due to his ignorance or if other people were treated just as unfairly.", "Interview Questions": "If you were struggling with the work, what signs would you show so I as your supervisor know that you need assistance?\r\n"}, {"date": "24 Jun 2018", "title": "Research Study Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through other source.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY)", "Interview Descriptions": "I first had a phone screening, then my first in person meeting with with the research manager and the project coordinator together.

To be honest, the biggest reason I declined the offer was because HR was so disorganized and didn't really show effort or care for me as a candidate. HR contacted me about a possible interview date/time and I responded asking if there was a later time available... He never responded to any calls or emails for the next 6 days  and then called me on the interview day to ask me if I could still come in despite knowing I was pretty far away.  I was also given the wrong department to interview with twice. And then when I finally received an offer, I was never given an official offer letter and he took almost a week to get back to me about details of the offer and whether benefits and compensation could be negotiated. Anyway, moving on to the actual interview process itself...\r\n\r\nThe first onsite interview is with HR. You're mostly asked about your qualifications and then given information about pay and benefits. This usually lasts about half an hour and then you get shuttled off to the main hospital to meet your prospective direct supervisors.  The department manager (your boss's boss) actually joined in the interview too which saved me time from coming in again. The questions were pretty standard: Why MSK? Tell me about yourself? What is your weakness? They seemed to be more behavioral questions rather than technical questions. This process lasted about an hour and was probably the most enjoyable part of the process. The people at MSK are clearly very competent and enjoy the work that they are doing.  They very personable and helped me understand the environment I'd be working in including the cons.\r\n\r\nAfter that first day, I was invited back to a second round of interviews to meet the program manager (your boss's boss's boss). The questions were also pretty standard and mostly related to how you deal with conflict/ how well you can work in a team.  The interview lasted a quick hour since it was mostly conversational.\r\n\r\nAnd then finally there was a third round of interviews with the attending physicians. I met with two people consecutively for about half an hour each. Strangely enough, these were by far the least technical interviews. I was barely asked about my experiences and qualifications; it was mostly questions about cultural fit and future plans.  One doctor said something like \"Honestly, this position doesn't require someone who is really smart and knows a lot. The work we do here is very simple, you just need to use common sense and be hardworking.\" It seemed like they were just looking for someone who would be reliable and will work well with the team. \r\n\r\nI received a verbal (phone call) offer from HR the next day.  I was interviewing with multiple companies at the time and asked for more information about their package so that I could compare them to my other offers but it took a lot of time before HR responded to me.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I decided to go with a different company.", "Interview Questions": "Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?

Received a call from HR the next day to set up a phone interview. The phone interview was about 20 minutes: what are your professional goals, why do you want to work at MSK, how did you handle a situation when you were under pressure, tell me about a time when you went above and beyond to get a job done. I was then asked to schedule for an in-person interview with the recruiter the next day, but due to my work schedule, I could only do the week after. The recruiter asked basically the same questions + what do you know about MSK? I was then to meet two administrative coordinators 3 hours later that day at the main hospital. \r\n\r\nHere's where it went downhill. I was told that a jitney would come by to pick up employees at the corner of Tunnel Exit Street and 40th to transport them to the hospital. The jitney comes at the :10 and :40. I set out to meet the jitney at the :10. Saw that it was a white van with a paper sign that says MSKCC Employees. But it never stopped on the corner. What I should have done at that point was to take the train since I noticed it didn't stop for me. So, that was my fault. However, I proceeded to wait around the area for the :40. I didn't see the jitney until :41 and it completely went by me. I tried to chase it down in my one inch heels but to no avail. Regardless of the method of transportation, I will be late to the :00 interview. I called my recruiter and explained to her what happened and if she can inform the administrative coordinators that I will be late. I ended up taking a cab to the hospital and was 11 minutes late to the interview. \r\n\r\nI honestly repressed the interview I had with the two administrative coordinators so well that I don't remember what questions they asked. They explained to me the format of the interview at the beginning, told me to use the STAR technique. It was a lot of behavioral questions. I didn't use the STAR technique at all, and at one point, didn't even answer one of the questions properly because it just didn't make sense to me (I unfortunately cannot remember what that question was). At the end, they said either they or my recruiter would keep in contact with me. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: I advise everyone to take the train or a cab to the hospital and avoid relying on the jitney at all costs. I also advise e-mailing the recruiter back regarding why you didn't get the job and what you could have done better. I have an idea of why I didn't get the job (besides failing to answer questions properly and the obvious lateness), but I should have asked. Also, you'll need to thank everyone you met for their time, which I didn't do either. So, yeah, I'm pretty terrible. But despite how much I bombed this interview, everyone I spoke with and met were all super nice and super professional. They did make me feel welcome and relaxed and my nerves were gone as soon as I spoke with them.\r\n\r\nFYI, completely unrelated: I'm currently on a one-woman mission to propose a new standard on the hiring process of this nation. This whole interview process and these BS interview questions are getting ridiculous. For people like me who are honest, hard working, but with no creative gene to make up answers on the spot, I'm getting turned down for jobs I know I will excel at, to people who are perhaps less hardworking than me but good at bullshitting. #downwithSTAR /End rant, good luck to all : )", "Interview Questions": "What's the best thing about your current job?"}], [{"date": "23 Mar 2016", "title": "Session Assistant I Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY) in Mar 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "I was sent a referral from my friend via email and I filled out an application which ended with an assessment test that tested for basic knowledge, typing speed, and personality questions. I received a phone call about 3 days later but I missed it. I called back and she scheduled a phone screening the next day. The phone screen asked questions like \"you just graduated, what do you plan doing now?\" \"what do you know about MSKCC?\" \"tell me about yourself.\" then she asked a couple of team-related behavioral questions. Then she explained the position and the salary. I agreed to the salary then she scheduled me for an in-person interview at HR. (phone interview was on a Thursday, in-person interview was scheduled for Monday) Monday came around and I was interviewed by the talent acquisition lady, one-on-one. She asked similar questions like \"why MSK?\" \"why Session Assistant?\" \"Strength?\" \"Weakness?\" A couple of behavioral questions were also asked like \"name a time you had a difficult group project\" (something along the lines like that). She then asked me if I had time for an interview with 2 supervisors later that day and I said yes. She then told me that there will be more behavioral questions and to answer them using STAR (situation, task, action, and result). The next interview was a little bit intense but I have prepared for it thanks to my friend and to Glassdoor. The 2 supervisors were past SA and they were very nice and very approachable. I answered to the best of my abilities. They had a packet of about 18-20 questions and each of them took turns asking and they were taking notes as I answered. When I was done answering they said that was it and that I should get a response by the end of the week hopefully. I was sent an email for references, I did them that night on my computer. 3 out of 5 of my references completed the survey the next day (Tuesday). And on Wednesday morning I got a call from HR offering me a position! I was worried at first because some Glassdoor reviews showed that after the 2 supervisors, they were also interviewed by a hiring manager. However I wasn't but I was still offered a position! The process was long but thorough. I understand why they take these steps because MSK is such a great company and I've seen how they treat their employees and even potential employees.

I'd say It wasn't until a 3 or 4 weeks from that time that I received an email from HR in regards to a phone interview. The phone interview took place a day or so after (I'll list the questions I remember below). It went fairly well, although to be honest I was surprised they contacted me because I did not prepare at all for the phone interview (make sure you always do your homework beforehand!). Got an email asking to meet with a Talent Acquisition Specialist and possibly with other members of the hiring staff. The in-person interview was then done the following week. The interview with the TAS lasted maybe 15-20 minutes and consisted of typical behavioral questions, questions about my resume, how I heard about MSK and then progressed to what working for them entailed, benefits and what not. I was then sent to meet with hiring staff for the particular department, I believe it was with the CRM and perhaps another RSA or higher up. It was during this that they shot a lot of questions my way mostly behavioral and situational, but also personality-esque questions and specifics about my previous research. I'd say the process went fairly well and the next day I was sent an email to meet with the physicians heading the project and after that the CRC. Met with everyone there the following week. The physicians asked questions similar to the CRM but not as intense, they seemed to reiterate the importance of the work of the position and commitment required to be successful. I then met with the CRC and one of his colleagues and it was more so the same behavioral type questions, how I heard about MSK and personality type questions. Felt the most laid back with them, but I still had to be on top of my game and professional. I heard back the following week stating the department I interviewed with wanted to move on with someone else, but there are other openings in some departments what want to go through with interviews.\r\n\r\nOverall the process was smooth and everyone involved was very personable and it was seen that they definitely enjoy working at MSK. Make sure to do your homework! I came to Glassdoor and basically looked at the RSA interview reviews and copied down the questions I could pull out from them onto a Word document and then answered them. I reviewed those the days leading up to the interviews and on the days of them. I would definitely recommend researching MSK itself and be familiar with some of their work. They seemed to respond very positively when I told them about specific projects that were going on at MSK when they asked how I heard about them.

This whole process took about 5 weeks. Then I received an email asking for references, two weeks later, references had been checked as two of them gave me a heads up. Everything was going great!

Me and the HR guy arranged for a phone interview the next day. He basically described the job, and later invited me for an in-person interview the following week. So, the day came. I arrived an hour early, waited an hour until I was called, and had my in-person interview with the recruiter. He asked a few assessment questions and immediately sent me to another building (the hospital) for another interview on the same day. This is when things went downhill.\r\n\r\nFirst, I could not find the shuttle he wanted me to take. I asked an officer in front of the building, and an NYPD officer outside for the exact location (based on a paper I was given), but no one knew. So, after giving up, I decided to take a cab. I figured I'd get there quickly. However, Obama happened to be around that day, so there were traffic jams after traffic jams. I arrived an hour later than I should have, and spent 25 dollars getting there. After being forced to wait, yet again, for the person to interview me, two white women finally met me. I explained what happened, and they seemed understandable. Then, finally, came the 2nd interview.\r\n\r\nThey sat me down in what looked like an interrogation room--it was small and only contained a round table with three chairs. The two women immediately took out packets filled with questions. I believe they had 17 assessment questions in all. They ran through all of them in a span of an hour (how many times have I written \"hour\" here?!). The questions involved my experiences with groups. Absolutely none of these were directly relevant to the job, my interest, my nature, my ideals, my goals, etc. They were all about occurrences in my past with groups. It's important to note that I had to give a specific example of whatever occurrence they asked of me. At first, I think I answered many of them well, but then I stumbled. They really expect you to become a story teller on the spot, as if a session assistant is going to be reading tales to the patients. Based on the quality of your stories, and how charismatic you are saying them, you either get the job or you don't.\r\n\r\nI, unfortunately, did not possess those qualities. The two women immediately left me in the room alone to discuss my assessment outside. Before I could say anything else, one reentered the room, told me they didn't have anymore questions, and said I could leave. I immediately knew I was shot down, and I was right. A week later, I received an e-mail from the recruiter saying I did not get the job. On top of that, they moved forward with candidates for every SA job available--not just the one I applied for.\r\n\r\nOverall, I disagree with their methods. Particularly, this assessment process. I don't see how it accurately gauges the qualifications of an applicant, as anyone can just bs their stories. But, perhaps, it's not about your answers at all, but your charisma, posture, and eye contact while saying them. Who knows.

The references are checked via a third party website and your reference (5 of them -  2 former managers 3 - peers, subordinates, and or coworkers)  have to fill out a survey on you via this website.  That was a little tasking because you have to run behind your reference and constantly remind them to do it.  It's probably best to have more than 5 references just in case some flake on you. You are able to go to the website to double check to see who completed their surveys or not.

About a month later, I was contacted by Pirooz in HR to set up an interview for a specific RSA position. On a Wednesday, I first met with Pirooz in the HR office and he went over the position I'd be interviewing for, along with the format of the interview process. First would be direct managers, then the manager of the service, and finally the doctor I'd be working with.\r\n\r\nI met with the direct managers who'd be supervising me for about 2 hours. They asked all the typical interview questions (e.g., name what you consider your greatest strength) and told me about the position. I had 10 minutes to review a paper description of the RSA role in regards to clinical trials, and then had a chance to ask questions. I'd prepped general questions in advance so I didn't have to think on the spot- that ended up being a good idea because there would have been silence had I not had questions. This portion of the process was the most intense and in depth.\r\n\r\nI then met with the manager of the service- that interview was ~15 minutes and she spoke mostly about what trials the service works on. I was asked about my interests and what I'd like to get out of the job. Overall, this section felt much more like a conversation than an interview. This was the last interview of the day for me; the total time was 10am-4pm, including travel and waiting time.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday (the day after), I received a call from Pirooz that the service wanted to set up a meeting with the doctor I'd be working with, for the following Wednesday. That interview was quick (<10 min) and focused equally on my skills and questions about the job. I do hear that some doctors have a more intense interview, so this section is the most variable because they don't have an interview script.\r\n\r\nThe day after my meeting with the doctor, Pirooz let me know that they wanted to move forward with the background check, which is the last step in the hiring process. I got 5 references to fill out the online form that night (recommended) and submitted. The background check part was a bit more difficult, as the company that MSK hired reviewed every single thing written on my resume. So I put down a volunteer position I'd had at a local hospital, and then had to track down the now-retired volunteer coordinator to confirm my work there as they did not keep paper records. My recommendation is to only put on your uploaded resume and in your online application those jobs that are relevant and easy to track down confirmation of employment.\r\n\r\nA week after my last interview, I heard again from Pirooz that my references and background check were successful, and that I got the job! Overall, a quick process for me. However, having now worked here for 2 years, I can say that this really depends on what is needed. Some people have waited 3 months to hear back from HR after submitting their online app, while others hear back the next day. However, once the interviews start, everything moves fairly quickly.\r\n\r\nThey ask for a 2 year commitment, but that's not written in stone- you're not bound to MSK.
