It felt very cold, impersonal, one-sided, and extremely awkward just staring at yourself answering questions. It didn't allow me to ask any of MY questions, or get an actual FEEL for any of the employees and the culture. The questions were also very stale, old-school, behavioral interviewing questions. I\u2019m extremely relieved that most companies no longer ask these types of questions and, instead, use the interview time as a \u201cget-to-know-you\u201d type meeting. I received a templated email confirmation from the recruiter to verify that she received my recorded interview, saying they'd notify me of next steps, and then I never heard from them again. I was surprised to find out that of the 4 different companies I was interviewing with, AHA was the poorest experience; had you asked me prior, I would\u2019ve guessed they would\u2019ve been #1.

I never did one before, so I researched and prepped like crazy (you have 4 days to complete it). The 4-5 questions were pre-recorded and you record your answer within a time limit.  It\u2019s awkward at first, but you can watch your response before submitting. If you don\u2019t like your first take, you have one additional try.  Before you begin that second try, you have all the time in the world to practice/prepare before hitting the timer. After submitting my responses I week later I was contacted to set up a 30 minute phone interview with the Executive Director and Regional VP, however he couldn\u2019t make it. The interview was great - I felt like I really connected with the executive director, who is whom I\u2019d report to. She explained the position and asked her questions - it felt more like a 30 minute conversation than an interview. About 48 hours later I was asked by my recruiter for a zoom interview the following week with the same two people for one hour. 2 weeks later I emailed for a status update and was then scheduled within 24 hours  for another zoom interview, this time with the Senior VP of Health Strategies in Tampa Bay and Senior VP of Development in Orlando for one hour. I felt like they really reviewed my resume beforehand as they asked a few specific questions to my cover letter and former employers/projects I worked on, which I really appreciated. I really connected with them both as we all had similar career backgrounds. I was offered the position 4 days later. The entire process took 6 weeks.

The overall experience was unnecessarily long and cumbersome for a position that was not supervising anyone. First, is the recorded video interview. As someone else mentioned, it was an impersonal format and did not allow for any questions from the interviewee. I'm not sure what this accomplishes except trying to assess your improv skills. You're also harassed everyday by their automatic email system to complete it ASAP even though you're told you have a week to do it. Next, I had to provide even more information on my application online. Third came a one-hour phone interview with the hiring manager, which had many tough situational questions for a first-time \"real\" interview. Fourth, was a request for grant writing samples. Fifth, was in invitation for a 3-hour interview at their Baltimore office, where there was only one actual person in attendance (commuted all of the way from New Jersey to be there) and talking to a computer screen the rest of the time with the other two interviewers. All emphasized the importance of collaborating with their Mid-Atlantic program staff at the office, yet I thought it was a red flag that they did not introduce me to any of them while there or include them in the interview, especially since this was supposedly the final step in the process. In the interview, the hiring manager for the position, the Director of Foundation Relations, thought it was worthwhile to ask me what my past supervisors would say are my strengths and weaknesses are for every single job I had on my resume, including my internship from 7 years ago. I think the most off-putting question was about whether or not I did anything rectify the situation after diplomatically explaining why I left my last job (not a good fit for what I want to do) and why I'm looking for a new one. To me, you're insinuating blame on the employee rather than the employer for why you choose to leave and begging for the person to bad-mouth their past employers. Even before this interview, I had to submit five professional references, which is again, excessive. These references received a reminder email everyday until they completed their review of me, which consisted of multiple pages of questions with many asking the same thing. All of this for no offer after nearly two months of radio silence following the interview.

Each question is displayed in writing on the screen and the AHA employee is talking about their perspective and experience and then asks the interview question all while a timer is counting down, which prompts the 2 minute window for you to record your response (by video). I believe they have the staff person talk a little about themselves or the organization to make it more personal, but it's distracting while you are also reading the question and trying to ready your response before their timer expires and your timer starts.

The email said \"it was a pleasure speaking to you on the phone today...\" followed by instructions on how to do the video/online interview. I was never phoned by HR. So I found this confusing and it took me several days to get in touch with her to figure out what was going on. She apologized for never actually calling me and just sending the email and asked me to move forward with the online video interview. After completing that I was contacted for a phone interview with her which I completed. Then she asked me to do a phone interview with the hiring manager. After that was completed she called me and said that they thought I was a \"rock star\" and wanted to move forward with the final in person interview with a panel of people. She said they were \"so confident with wanting to hire me that they wanted me to do an online personality assessment and complete a more detailed application to include references.\" This online assessment and the time it took for me to include many more details into my online application took me approximately 3 hours of time to complete. I then went in for my in person interview which went very well and took about two hours. I was told by both HR and the hiring panel that I would be notified the following week on moving forward. The following week I heard nothing. I reached out to HR once mid-week and left a vm asking where they were in the hiring process. She never returned my call. The next week I reached out again and left ANOTHER vm for. She did not return my call. Since I was holding off on making some future plans and commitments because I had been given a very strong indication from HR that they would be making me an offer... I tried calling a third time using a blocked caller ID. MY HR recruiter picked up the phone on the second ring and once I identified myself she acted like she had no idea who I was. After she did realize who I was, she said the position has been filled and she sent me an email that I did not receive the position. After triple checking my email, I will verify, that I NEVER received an email from HR or anyone else at the AHA telling me I did not get the position. I am very dissatisfied with the interview process since I took over 10 hours of my personal time to complete all the different interviews and steps. Was led to believe on several occasions from HR that I would be offered the job. And then, no one had the consideration to even call me to tell me that I did not get the position or give me any explanation or reason why. I feel like when someone goes this far in the interview process and it is only down to a few people, AHA should at least have the consideration to call that person... not claim they sent and email which was never sent.
