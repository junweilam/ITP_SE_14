Here is an employee perspective:\r\n\r\nThey call you pretty quickly for undergraduate recruitment, because the job has a lot of turnover, but this is the best way to get into the university system quickly.\r\n\r\nThey solicit your references FIRST before meeting you, which I think is a bit weird. Be sure to let your references know they'll receive an email! After all of mine were sent in, I was called for an interview.\r\n\r\nMy interview contact was a really nice woman, and smiled quite a bit/made conversation before leading me back to the interview area. Be prepared for an unnecessary amount of interviewers! There were EIGHT people interviewing me. Yes, eight. It made the room cramped.   Some of them were current recruiters, and they all looked very \"muted\", and maybe even a bit unhappy. \r\n\r\nThey asked about two and a half pages, front and back, of questions, and it quickly became repetitive. By the second page, a lot of them ended up being the same questions but reworded. \r\n\r\nAfter answering all of those questions, you have to do your presentation. I felt like this is a very relevant part of the interview, because you could be giving presentations at schools. They were engaged during this part, but just barely.\r\n\r\nBy the time I left, I decided that this was probably not a department or role that I wanted to be in. I was honestly exhausted from just the interview! I  Applied to another admin job in another department immediately afterwards, which is where I am now.
