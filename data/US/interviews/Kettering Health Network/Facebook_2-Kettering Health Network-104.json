A friend sent my resume to the Comms Director for a networking intro,  who then expressed interest about hiring me instead. \r\n\r\nI was not in Ohio at the time, but the Marketing Director did reach out to explore the role. I was open because I was currently in a big transition phase and was willing to move if the position was worth it. \r\n\r\nThree rounds of interviews. First was just with the Director and was very casual. Ask about my background and if I had any questions. Didn't offer a lot in the way of the role unless I asked. \r\n\r\nSecond was more formal and also just with the Director. When I mentioned my salary range she seemed a bit taken aback. I purposely went high with the expectation that we'd negotiate. She said that wasn't possible for that area of Ohio but did meet me at the lower end. \r\n\r\nThird interview (which came WEEKS later) was put on a call with the 4 other managers at my level. Director was not on the call and did not communicate she wouldn't be there or who else would be present, so I was a bit surprised and thrown off. The team interview was weird. One girl mentioned I seemed more like an executive and didn't understand why I wanted to work there. It felt like they weren't very prepared and maybe told to do this at the last minute.\r\n\r\nI still followed up with a thank you the next day, naming each person and thanking them for their time. No response back. Nothing. Was ghosted and never contacted again. \r\n\r\nIn general, I found the lack of communication and clear expectations about the interview process and role itself to be unprofessional and lazy.  Considering I was asked out of the blue to interview and was not looking for the position, not receiving a formal 'thanks but no thanks' it felt rude and like a tremendous waste of my time. Relayed this to my friend who was pretty angry. \r\n\r\nI gathered from the calls that there are other healthcare networks in that area that pay better and offer more in the way of professional support, so if I were in Ohio actively looking for a Comms role with a healthcare network, I'd try another place first or at least keep your options open while interviewing here. I'd move on if you don't hear anything within a few days after an interview because they won't give the courtesy of a formal no.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work with Kettering Health? \r\nTell me a little about yourself."}], [{"date": "1 Feb 2022", "title": "Registered Nurse Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Kettering Health Network in Oct 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview was fairly straightforward and comfortable.
