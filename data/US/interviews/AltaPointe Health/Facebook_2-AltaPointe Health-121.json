The first interview lasted a total of 10 minutes.  It didn't go well.  They made me wait longer than my interview lasted.  I got the call for the second interview the next morning and turned it down because of my perception of the company's knowledge of mental health and the poor pay.\r\n\r\nPrior to the interview I was called and told to apply for as many positions as I wanted to be interviewed for, so I did.  When I got to the initial interview I was told that I could only go through the interview process for one position, which the hiring manager chose without fully explaining the differences.  I had applied for about 6 positions and they chose one of the lowest paying and most dangerous positions to recommend me for.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving, the hiring manager told me that my masters degree did not make me eligible for masters level positions and that I was not going to be considered for any of them until I provided a transcript and it was evaluated and approved.  I have a masters in psychology with an emphasis on clinical psychology.  Based on the hiring manager's expectations, they want all masters level employees to have a counseling degree.  So, when you are looking at positions if it says masters degree don't apply unless you have completed 2 mental health internships.  If I had pressed the matter, I probably could have gotten my transcript approved, but it didn't seem worth the effort for $10.78 an hour when everywhere else I've interviewed at during the past week has offered me a third or double more.  Even if none of the interviews this week work out for me, I'd rather continue my job search and that is saying something since job searching is a horrible process.\r\n\r\nMy advice for individuals with psychology degrees, bachelors or masters level, is to look elsewhere.  There are places in Mobile that pay more for less work and fewer hours.  You just have to look a bit further than AltaPointe. \r\n\r\nI was asked:\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to do?\"\r\n\"What population do you want to work with?\"\r\n\"How would you handle a crisis situation?\"\r\n\"Are you comfortable in crisis situations?\"\r\n\r\nSince there seemed to be an emphasis on the crisis stuff, I asked how often they expected there to be a \"crisis situation.\"  I was told once a week.  I might have to get the police involved and I might not be able to leave if the situation looks bad.  Then I was told if I worked in the hospital there might be a crisis once an hour.  I've worked in a mental hospital of a comparable size and that is unacceptable.  Where I worked previously had 50 beds and treated individuals currently experiencing psychosis and they only had a \"crisis\" maybe three or four times over a period of months.  Either something is terribly wrong here or the hiring manager's information is very inaccurate.", "Interview Questions": "What population do you want to work with?"}, {"date": "17 Jan 2014", "title": "Therapist ; Work With Federal Parolees, Dual Diaganosis and Severe Mental Health Issues Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at AltaPointe Health (Mobile, AL) in Oct 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "Two interviews; 1-2 weeks of  comapny policy; safety, computer netwoking skills and training.
