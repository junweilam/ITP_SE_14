This account will surely be longer than others to hopefully bring light to their \u201corganized interview practices\u201d:\n\nI had two amazing interviews with a \u201cpanel\u201d of interviewers, which consisted of one phone interview and one video conference. The questions I was asked mainly focused on my experience, and emphasized how I\u2019d preform in certain situations. I was not given any account from the interviewers during either interview regarding what, exactly, I\u2019d be managing if hired for this role\u2014 however, this didn\u2019t bother me as much as I now realize it should have. From the beginning, I was clear and upfront that I was a candidate that was relocating to the area from across the country, and the team seemed to be receptive of this and even excited for me. Up until my following unpleasant experience, I sincerely loved the team and thought we\u2019d work well together. \n\nThe part where this turned negative was the fact that AFTER these two interviews, I was seen to be \u201cdisqualified\u201d via my light quantifiable experience. I mean, my resume details my \u201cyears of experience\u201d in full for the corporate positions I have previously worked, but I was asked by a director/coordinator of the department via email to send over an account of the \u201cexact amount of hours and months\u201d and \u201ca summary of tasks completed\u201d for my collegiate extracurricular roles in an attempt to ensure qualification for the \u201cexact year requirement needed for the role per HR requirements\u201d. Bonus: I was also asked to specify whether these roles- dubbed \u201cvolunteer roles\u201d (ex: RA and sorority positions) had been \u201cpaid/unpaid\u201d. I\u2019d give a bit of leeway for a corporate office to mix up extra curriculars as potential \u2018paid/unpaid\u2019 positions, but this interview in question was for a role at a collegiate organization...which makes you wonder, \u201creally?\u201d One would hope that the \"panel\" had reviewed my credentials prior to the initial interview as my experience was said to be \"great\u201d for the role, but since I was later found to be a \u201cyear short\u201d I was asked to give a detailed account of my extra curricular roles and their descriptions/tasks to try to \u201cmake up for the gap\u201d. I found this practice odd and highly disorganized, but I complied as best I could. \n\nThese odd and somewhat insulting questions regarding my extra curricular activities \u201cvolunteer roles\u201d were asked leading up to and ON my moving day via email from the director of the department. Throughout the process, it almost seemed as though jumping on a quick call to give this additional information was frowned upon so I was subjected to untimely and intrusive \u201cback and forth\u201d email chains that stretched this process out to the point (almost a month after the first interview) where I was unable to answer \u201cASAP\u201d because I was literally in the middle of moving. I figured I\u2019d answer this \u201cmoving day email\u201d as soon as I had reached my destination  just in case there were any additional arbitrary \u201cfollow up\u201d back and forth emails to follow that I needed to respond to \u201cASAP\u201d.  \n\nAfter 3 days of driving, I tried to respond as best as I could to the email sent to me on my moving day 1 business day earlier. In an attempt to set needed boundaries with this director, I also politely added that \u201cif there were any other questions that needed to be answered ASAP on my part to move this process forward to please CALL ME\u201d (as my wifi had not be set up yet and I needed time to unpack after my move.) This, I felt, implied that I (understandably) could not be glued to my email in order to focus on wrapping up my move to the area. \n\nAfter this final reply politely asking for all future ASAP questions or communications to be directed to a call, my prior 3.5 weeks worth of effort were thrown out the window.  These weeks featured two interviews, an odd \u201cemail only\u201d reference check, and a  very strange previously detailed back and forth of untimely and seemingly intrusive \u201cfinal follow up questions\u201d via email. I was then sent a generic rejection email from someone I had not even built rapport with in the panel of interviewers I had spoken with previously. This tactic felt extremely disingenuous and unappreciative of the time I had spent as an applicant who had shown \"exactly what they were looking for.\"\n\nIn conclusion: My unpleasant experience interviewing with ASU seems to follow the negative experience of others who have shared a similar odd \u201ccop out\u201d is received late in the interview process- after everything seems to be at a stopping point. This \u201ccop out\u201d I personally experienced made the department I interviewed with seem extremely disorganized and unsure of what their hiring priorities/strategies were. Setting necessary communication boundaries is not applauded nor appreciated, I suppose (how ironic), when interviewing with ASU which makes me feel like I dodged a bullet in terms of actually working for this disorganized organization.", "Interview Questions": "Describe a way you created a new \u201ccommunication tactic\u201d in your organization"}, {"date": "14 Oct 2022", "title": "Senior Recruiter Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Arizona State University (Tempe, AZ) in Mar 2020", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview process is extremely lengthy.

Took them about 4+ months to call me, but I now work there and see that is common.\r\n\r\nPhone interview with several members of team. They usually ask about 4 or 5 situational questions. If you are familiar with STAR format, that is the system they follow. A week later I was called back for an in-person interview.\r\n\r\nIn person interview took place on campus. Panel included my potential supervisor, a member of the team, a person who was doing a job similar to the one I was interviewing for, and another member of the department I was interviewing with. Was called 2 weeks later with an offer. Pay was bottom of the range and firm - no negotiating possible. I accepted because I really wanted to work for ASU and haven't regretted it.\r\n\r\nRandom Tips: \r\nI have since been on several hiring committees at ASU and the experience outlined above is commonly how things work. The hiring managers like to have a mixture of individuals on the interview panels to get a more well-rounded opinion of the candidate and they will include people at all levels, not just manager-types. This being an organization that focuses heavily on student engagement and the ability to work with diverse populations, the focus is generally on how well-liked you will be and how easily you connect with people from various backgrounds/job levels. The questions will follow a STAR format and they will be grading you based on how well your response shows job-area knowledge and how your experience relates to the position. The questions themselves are not hard to answer and are very basic. What I have found through working with various committees is that they are mostly looking for someone who can easily do the job with little training, will be well-liked by both students and staff (i.e. have a positive attitude, show initiative, show that you are really excited to work with students and be part of a college environment..they really like positive, upbeat people and will refer constantly to the \"energy\" a person put forth in the interview) and has as much experience as possible. This is not the type of place, culturally, where they are looking to train someone who has never done the job...experience is key. Even if your experience is just as a student worker or through an internship, you should focus on how that experience will translate well into the position you're interviewing for. Before you go to the interview, really read the job description and think about ways that your experience relates to what they are looking for. They personally screen the resumes and will be looking for well-written cover letters that connect experience to the position they're hiring for. It's a very casual workplace and it's okay to show some personality but we have definitely had people who go overboard. Show that you are flexible, fun and able to get the job done.
