I was told by a representative that they are responsible for acquiring donations to the University by making phone calls. I was also told they pay up to $10 per hour, so I went home and applied online (the only way to apply). Within a day I received a phone call from the Phone Center. They conducted a phone interview and was told if I met their requirements I would be asked back for a group interview. They asked about how I found out about the center, what would I expect if I worked there, and what I could offer as a student fundraiser. Also they made sure to ask if I was okay with asking someone for money four times in the same phone call. Of course, I told them I was since thats essentially the job. They asked me back for a group interview, which was not what I expected. I had imagined a bunch of us sitting in a round table being asked different sorts of questions. Instead, there were only 4 of us in my interview and we were asked to introduce ourselves and to tell a little about ourselves. \r\nAfter we all got to know each other, the interviewer (the manager) had us pick out a random object from a box which we would have to sell. I got a coffee mug. The box was filled with very bland items probably just collected from around the office (Can of Lysol, mug, thermal, and stamp). Next, we were given out cards which held a reason we might be given from someone we call as to why they cannot make a donation. We had to come up with a rebuttal as to what we would tell the person on the other end of the call. They were anything from \"I just bought a house\" to \"My finances do not allow me to.\" Essentially, the group interview consisted of tasks that tested our ability to sell and be persistent. In addition to the group interview, we needed to fill out a survey that asked more questions. The responses to these questions and the responses at the group interview would be considered for a follow up personal interview. \r\nI got called back for the personal interview and was quite surprised. At the one-on-one interview with the same manager from the first interview, I got asked the typical questions \"Tell me more about yourself\" \"what kind of activities or clubs are you part of on campus?\" \"Why are you the best candidate for the position?\" I responded very well to all of these and thought they were quite simple. The hardest part of the interview came when the manager asked me to conduct a mock phone call and handed me a script. I read the script and said everything with confidence, until I got to the part where I ask for a $250 donation. His response was \"I just graduated from Grad school and have student loans to pay.\" It took me longer than it should have to come up with a proper response but when I did, all the manager said was, \"Thank you, thats all\" and he continued onto the policies at the workplace. Its been two days since my interview and do not think I will get an offer, but he did mention that we are sent an email even if we do not get it.
