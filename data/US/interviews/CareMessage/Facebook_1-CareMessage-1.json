Vineet the CEO reached out to me to interview for their VP of Sales role. He was 3 minutes late to the Zoom meeting. He didn't turn his camera on. Vineet starts by saying I have a couple questions for you, then I'm going to turn the time over to you. I now understand why they have awful reviews, and his employees don't like him. Vineet doesn't know how to run an interview, I'm worried how he is running a company.", "Interview Questions": "What do you need in your next role?"}, {"date": "13 Jan 2023", "title": "VP of Sales Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through other source.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at CareMessage in Sept 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "There were 5 interviews scheduled, spread across multiple leaders and including an executive case study. They do a lot of vetting for this role, and I was excited about the challenge of crushing every interview. Interviews themselves weren't too bad, and were standard stuff. But, after leading me on for the entire process, they called and said they weren't moving forward with me for \"people management\" reasons.

It seems they're hiding real reasons for not wanting to move forward, but I'm not surprised anymore after reading other interview reviews and employee reviews. Don't expect transparency from this company. Proceed with caution.", "Interview Questions": "How do you embrace diversity and inclusion in your current role?"}], []]
