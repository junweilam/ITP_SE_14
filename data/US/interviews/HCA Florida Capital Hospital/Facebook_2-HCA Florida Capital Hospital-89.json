He did about a 30 minute phone interview asking about my experience in pharmacy and my certifications and my schedule. I had applied for an evening overnight position and this was very clear, he even asked if i could handle a FT overnight and still go to school. Two days pass and he calls back asking if i can meet with the interim director of pharmacy. I have only one day to choose but 3 time slots. I am directed in an email what time to arrive (15 minutes early) and where to go, this was considerate of them. \r\n So I arrive 15 minutes early and head to HR as directed. I wait about 5 minutes for the receptionist to finish her call and am told to have a seat. The Pharmacy Director comes and gets me. First we tour the Pharmacy and I know the equipment. They've got your standard pyixs medstation, an older model carousel and good size bulk dose machine. Their clean room looked decent, I've seen better/ I've worked with worse. Their stock set up seemed confusing and disorderly and was located in two separate places in the hospital (not just the pharmacy).  \r\n We finally went to the directors office across the hall and she had some questions. She seemed very nice. She was what i would expect of a practical Pharmacy Director. No flare. You could tell she actually works and is not just a face of the pharmacy. She also has some time under her belt as well as the education to back it all up. But she did not take notes on what I said. She only asked me 3 questions but for some reason seemed to do more talking then I. Whats your most stressful situation and how did you handle it? Have you ever implemented a new policy and why?  How do you handle mistakes? I had already discussed my compounding and chemo experience. \r\n Then came the big let down. She explained that the position I had originally applied for had been terminated by the company. And that the overnight position was being \"tried\" by another staff member. ( i respect that.) She said she had an 8-4 position to fill but i said it would not work with my school schedule. (I should have brought my school schedule with me in print.) 12$ p/h is not worth giving up school sorry. I asked if since she was utilizing another member of her staff for the overnight if she needed a part time or prn staff member, but never got a straight yes or no.  She showed me out and in doing so mentioned some employee stuff, But I never got a call.", "Interview Questions": "She asked me the names of the Pharmacist I worked with that went to her Alma mater, but did not know either of them, it was awkward and pointless. The mistakes question. Its a reoccurring one in the pharmacy world but its a two sided question your either a liar or a screw-up.
