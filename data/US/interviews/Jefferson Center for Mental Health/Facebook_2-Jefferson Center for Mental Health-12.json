The whole process took about three months as I went deep into the interview process. They ask for references right off the bat which is something I would reconsider because it can be bothersome to your references to have to notify them that a company may be reaching out over and over again. I suggest saving that for the end of the application process. \n\nThe team leader I was in contact with was personable enough and seemed to be very knowledgeable about the position, however after the final interview, there was radio silence from the whole philanthropy team after reaching out. Not that I necessarily expect daily correspondence or anything, but often times candidates put a lot of effort into applying for a position so a little bit more effort on their end would be nice. On that note, receiving a boilerplate, copy paste rejection email weeks after the fact from a name I\u2019ve never heard of was rather insulting given the amount of effort I put into learning about the company and the position itself. Again, not expecting an essay but a quick thank you email from someone on the team would have been nice. \n\nAll in all, I wish Jefferson Center the best in their mission as this is a cause I hold very dearly, however, a few changes to their hiring practices would make things a lot more palatable for candidates.", "Interview Questions": "How do you handle disagreement?
