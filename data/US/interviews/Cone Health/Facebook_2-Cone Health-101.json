I did two interviews and then was introduced to the entire team. I was asked to come in and shadow the team, which was scheduled two and half weeks out from the time of the interview because they said they wanted to make sure I would get the chance to fully experience the role. I passed up other opportunities because I was genuinely excited about the job and they gave me every reason to believe I would most likely receive an offer. I came in on the scheduled date and shadowed multiple team members over the course of about four hours. I was then told I would hear from them within 1-2 weeks. At the end of two weeks, I called to ask if they had made a decision. I was told that they preferred to hire internally, had already offered the job to an internal candidate, and had been waiting all this time for that person to make a decision. Since that person had just accepted, I was no longer being considered. So basically, they had me interview multiple times and then do four hours of unpaid training for a role I was never seriously considered for in the first place. I understand interviewing multiple candidates for a role, but to keep someone on the hook for so long just to give your intended candidate more time to decide if they even want the role is unprofessional and disrespectful.
