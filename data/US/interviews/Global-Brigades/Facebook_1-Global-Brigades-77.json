I returned this but didn't hear anything until I mailed again to check it was received one month later.  It was, but no decision was made at that point. I then got a generic email a few weeks later to say that things were still being processed due to volume of applications, but when I still hadn't heard back and saw the advert was once again live on the site a few weeks following this and after hearing nothing, I asked for some feedback about what I could have done better (in May)....and was invited to an interview (June)! Apart from the incorrect time being given for the interview (time zone mistake - luckily I was one hour early not late!), I think the interview was fair, the interviewer was friendly and I was provided a lot of information about the role.  I was told I'd hear back in 3 weeks (the role was due to start end of July,  just a couple of weeks after that ). I didn't hear anything, and when I sent an email four weeks later to say thank-you and ask if there were any updates, I was told I didn't get the job. I asked for feedback again a week or so later but didn't get a response. \r\n\r\nI've now seen the same role live again due to start in September and although I'd be interested in applying again, I'm not sure whether there's any point. Although the rejection email encouraged me to apply in future, the fact I wasn't given any feedback makes me think they might not be so keen on receiving applications from me in future and also makes it difficult to see where I need to improve upon last time! I think I was quite nervous in the last interview and I might feel more confident next time but...it could be that they're looking for a kind of experience which I still haven't gained a few months later.
