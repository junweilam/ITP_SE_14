I was very excited because it was a position where I was looking to head in my career by working in the industry of entertainment, but it also was great because I would be giving back to our service members. The phone screen went well, hiring manager was brash in one response stating I wouldn't be working just with \"music\" and I emphasized I knew that and was still interested anyways. I was then scheduled for an in-person interview with the entire department and sent the benefits package info. To me, that communicated that I was probably a top tier choice for the position to have me meeting VPs and the Director for just the second stage of the interview. I prepared for the interview by doing research on the USO history and operations within entertainment. I come from a generational military family and currently work with the military at my employer, so I knew to defiantly emphasize that during my interview.\r\n\r\nI had. a web interview for the first part because the SVP worked remotely. I then met with the rest of the team I would be presumably working with. It felt like a breeze! I wasn't asked any hard hitting questions, more just about myself and how I stay organized, etc. Since the hiring manager was out most of the process, I was told by the HR Assistant that I could hear back in a day or two when the hiring manager returned. I did my due diligence and sent all my thank you's post interview. A few days had passed and I still had not heard anything, so I emailed the hiring manager and got the generic rejection email.  Sadly, I did not receive an offer. I believe it had to do with my salary expectations, as I stated my range, and never received feedback from the hiring manager if that was reasonable to the USO being a non-profit and all. I think that was the most frustrating part looking back and probably gave me my answer all along (The hiring manager was also trying to pry in to my previous salary history during our phone screen, which isn't that illegal? I was not wanting to give her ammunition to use against me so I was very vague, but then the USO later made me input my salary history through their application system anyways) If my salary was more than they were willing to offer I wish they had not worked my hopes up and sent me the benefits package along with meeting the ENTIRE TEAM I would be supporting in the second stage.

Interviewer shot down almost every response I gave to her questions. Her negative attitude toward me could be heard over the phone by her demeaning tone. When I tried to provide myself an opportunity to SHINE, her response was usually \"That doesn't matter\". For example, when I tried to explain my educational goals and passion for learning.  Interviewer replied by saying, \"That doesn't matter, this job doesn't require a degree\". \"The job only requires you to provide resources and follow-up.\" I guess she was implying I'm over qualified by holding a Bachelors, while pursing a Masters? (I believe understanding educational processes is highly important in supporting transitioning military personnel who want to continue their education after military service)\r\nInterviewer was only interested in my last two jobs. I told her I'd like to add my experiences working on a military base. Interviewer replied, \"That doesn't matter\". I followed-up by explaining  it does matter because I have experience working with military families, the specific clients which USO serves! Her reply  was simply \"Hm, okay\". \r\nInterviewer  asked me how much money I'm looking to make.  After I replied, her response was\"You're not going to make that here, XZY at very the most\". \r\nI also tried to explain that both my parents are military vets, however she did not care that I have personal life experience with military resources and member services. USO claims they support military families and their mission to serve. However, based off this phone interview, I'm no longer interested in working for USO.\r\n\r\nClearly stated on the USO website for conducting interview \"Share personal experiences to illustrate your critical skills and achievements.\"\r\n\"Describe experiences and career/LIFE periods reflected in your resume.\"\r\n\"Focus on the positives of all your past experiences and remain optimistic.\"\r\n\r\nDespite her insults, I chose to take the high road and not hang-up on the Interviewer, I was very close to doing so. I've never been disrespected during an interview.  I tried to contact HR dept via phone and email, no response.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I received a phone call from Interviewer's boss on 7/11/18. He only called because my husband contacted USO through their website.  My husband knew I was hurt and upset. Boss stated HR and company went to ball game today, the reason for no response.  I told him, I was very confused as to why Interviewer emailed on Monday 7/9/18 saying she was \"impressed\" with my resume and requested to speak with me only to tear me down during the phone interview.  In regards to her repeatedly saying \u201cThat doesn't matter\" throughout the interview, Boss asked me if she was being \"dismissive\" rather than \u201cdemeaning\". Regardless, No one should be told \"That doesn't matter\" in ANY context.  Candidates are given this opportunity to sell themselves. Whatever comes out of a candidates mouth MATTERS to them. Period!  ALL the Interviewer had to do was type out my responses and forwarded them, no need for her judgments. Boss asked me what should be done. I stated Interviewer  needs more training so this NEVER happens to anyone else. I never had an Interviewer make me feel so little. I was truly hurt by this experience.

I as asked by a USO recruiter if myself or anyone I knew would be interested in applying so I said that I was interested. We scheduled a phone screen for the following week which was a standard resume review, general overview of the position and information on the interview process, lasting about a half hour. On this call I was told that they were looking to hire pretty quickly because they had filled the position recently with a \"bad fit\" and needed to fill the position ASAP. After this I did not hear back from the recruiter regarding next steps for a month. After a month had passed I assumed they found another candidate but I received an email from the recruiter saying that the hiring manager had been out of town for the last month and asked if I was still interested. I hesitantly (because this seemed fishy to me) but still excitedly said yes. We then scheduled a phone interview with the hiring manager. Again, this was a pretty standard first interview followed with a request to set up an in person meeting to meet with 6 people including the HM. \r\n\r\nIn person I first met with the hiring manager for one hour, then a panel of four team members for an hour and then with the VP for one hour. Questions asked were very specific and difficult. From there I was asked back for the final portion of the interview the following week. This included a presentation and another question and answer panel with three employees including the HM and the VP again. I was asked to pitch a corporate sponsor who I would like to target with the panel acting as the company I was pitching. This included researching a company that I saw as a good fit and putting together a case study/presentation for the team. My total time spent on creating this pitch was about 12 hours.\r\n\r\nI left the interview feeling good even though again, the follow up questions  very specific and difficult. A couple days after the interview I followed up with the recruiter who sent me back a very generic email saying that the hiring manager decided to go with a different candidate. I was shocked and disappointed that after having spent three months, 7 interview hours and time on creating the case study, all I received was what seemed like an automated rejection email. My suggestion to the USO would be, if you have a candidate who you know is passionate and has taken the time to interview with you all the way through the final interview phase, that you take the time to have the hiring manager, or even the recruiter, call the candidate to let them know that they didn't get the position, thus giving them an opportunity to ask questions and learn how they can improve in the future.", "Interview Questions": "What are some companies that you would like to target and why?\r\nWhat will you accomplish in your first 90 days?\r\nWhy would you like to go into cause related marketing over individual giving?\r\nGive an example of a corporate sponsor you have recruited?\r\nHow do you recognize the USO?\r\nWhy did you chose to pitch a company that would give us an in-kind donation versus straight cash?\r\nWhy USO?\r\nDo you think we have good brand recognition?\r\n\r\n"}, {"date": "21 Mar 2017", "title": "Temporary Center Operations Specialist Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at USO (Arlington, VA) in Mar 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied online through the USO website.
