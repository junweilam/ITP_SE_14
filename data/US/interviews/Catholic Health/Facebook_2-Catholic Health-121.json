If you pass the  phone screening questions they'll schedule you for an in-person interview with the hiring manager. \nI have to say the process felt very long - at least one month between applying, phone screen and in-person interview - that's even without getting hired and orientation.\nI was discouraged however, there were computer issues with the hiring managers online scheduling causing HR to schedule my interview on a day the hiring manager was off. So when I arrived for my in person interview, I ultimately did not get interviewed by the person I was supposed to be interviewed by. But after what I felt to be a great interview experience and I thought the interview went really well, I ultimately never heard a word back and was ghosted. I followed up twice, and nothing, no response or letter, nothing. Real disappointing. When I heard that the hiring manager wasn't working that day - I felt a sinking feeling in my gut that it'll hurt my chances. But hey, it could have been anything - that they hired someone else, found a better candidate, who knows. A tip is - The only sure sign you got the job is an offer, so whatever happens in the interview, the \"good signs\" are just subjective even if you felt it went really well - but this was just my experience. Otherwise, I felt it was a positive experience, I have nothing else bad to say.

The interview went well once it started, no surprise questions, and she was very friendly and provided a wealth of information about the position, as well as benefits and salary without me having to even ask. Afterwards, she walked me to the unit which I was  applying to work on, introduced me to the unit manager, and he proceeded to do his own interview with me. The interview was very casual and easy going, and gave a good feel of how the unit would be. I had a great feeling leaving the interview, and the unit manager told me to expect to hear back within a few weeks, as they had several openings available on the unit. Based on his response to my experience and answers to questions, I left feeling rather certain I would get an offer. For the next several weeks I tried repeatedly to reach out to both the recruiter I had met with as well as the manager and received no response from anyone. I tried calling, leaving messages, sending emails, everything I could think of. Finally I gave up and accepted a position at another hospital with a higher salary and better benefits, which I applied for after my interview with Good Samaritan. About a week after starting at the other hospital they finally called me and offered me the position (about 6 weeks after my interview at this point) with orientation starting a week later. Even if I hadn't already accepted another job the time frame would have forced me to leave my previous job on short notice in order to attend their orientation, and I did not want to burn bridges as I was leaving my prior employer on good terms.

I said yes, and was asked to interview with the recruiter on Wednesday. \r\n\r\nThe recruiter asked first what my GPA was and then how I heard about the hospital and why I wanted to work there. She also asked about my interests as far as specialties (critical care, ER, etc). Another question was about my future plans and my goals/where I see myself in 5 years. She also asked about a challenging decision I had to make and how I came to the ultimate decision.

A little later into the interview they asked about organizational skills. They mostly wanted to know what my organization style was (ie. do I prefer making to-do lists, etc). They also asked about my learning style (hands on, auditory learner, visual learner, etc). And at the end they asked me if I had questions for them.
