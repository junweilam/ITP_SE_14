The recruiter was friendly and didn't ask too many questions.  She said that they already had internal candidates who would be a good fit for the position that I'd applied for but recommended me for another open position.   She asked what questions I had and described the next step in the process for me.  They base their decision entirely off of the second step in the process - a talent assessment, which she scheduled for me shortly after our conversation ended.  The talent assessment took place over the phone that evening. It lasted about 45 minutes or so and was completed by Talent+.  I didn't hear back after the assessment, but I assume had I \"passed,\" an in-person interview would have been the next step.", "Interview Questions": "I can't give too much detail, but the talent assessment asked several variations of the same question to find out how competitive I was.  The assessor did not provide feedback to any of my responses and you could tell the intention was to pose the next question quickly so that I wouldn't have a lot of time to think about my response - it would just be what came to my head the fastest, implying that it was the most honest.  The assessor was professional and courteous, but it was difficult to hear her at multiple points during the assessment.  The questions were mired in gender and cultural bias (women, and particularly women are color, aren't \"supposed\" to come across as competitive) and were along the vein of - have you stopped beating your children; yes or no? - meaning there really wasn't a good or accurate response to many of the questions.  It went on for a while and close to the end, I really just wanted it to be over.  I've never experienced this feeling during an interview or job assessment before.  I was saddened that this is the new hiring process for the hospital.  As I said, I worked there previously and really enjoyed my time there and felt that the culture was excellent.  This introduction to the company was extremely off-putting and I feel it will exclude many women, people of color, and servant leaders, despite their actually being good fit for the position and company.  Had I not worked for Mercy before, I would have determined that it was not a good fit for me (or anyone, really), based on this interviewing experience.  It would have even been better if they'd done the assessment later in the process, perhaps with final candidates, but not where it's the first and only thing they go by.  My master's degree is in psychology and even I will admit that these sorts of assessments are not entirely accurate. So, to use it and only it as the basis for a major decision isn't a good idea.   Also, the name of the assessment if misleading.  They don't assess your talents - they assess what people feel their traits to be.  I wouldn't recommend this process to anyone.

She was newer to her role but was accommodating and provided a lot of good information. The 3rd party interview was a personality screening that took place over the phone but was very useful, in my opinion. The onsite interview took place with the Executive Director, a panel of managers (who would be my peers), and a physician panel. There was an extensive tour of the facilities and the ability to meet many of the staff of the hospital. Mercy paid for a car rental, a hotel room, and dinner. They also set up a community tour with a local realtor the next day. My husband and I were very excited about the possibility. After leaving the interview August 15th, the executive director told me I would hear by the end of the month. I understand this is a large organization and many hoops and lines to sign. \r\nAfterwards, I sent a Thank You to both the director and the HR director for the hospitality and their time.
