After another month I got the rejection letter Two main complaints: 1. The 1 month response time between each stage 2. I expected know-it-all snobs going into the interview. That's what I got. No surprise there. But this interview was pretty special. They take themselves way too seriously. Do you really need a SIX-person panel to interview someone for a below-market wage developer job?? I only did the interview for practice and I'm baffled by this. There were two interviewers in particular that seemed so distant emotionally, and out of place in the panel. They seemed unhappy and distracted by other things. As it came to their turn to ask questions, they seemed almost robotic, the way they greeted me and asked me their questions as if going off a script. The questions this pair asked were so generic and served no purpose in prying the candidate for talent. See below. There were some interviewers that knew what they were talking about and we had some good conversations going. Overall, a very pretentious and extra silicon valley mindset. Horrible interviewers.

All physical scientists were top notch researchers and IT staff, and were very capable professionals (which matched my level). Lone manager was a very different story. Manager announced that \u201cYou need to get yelled at\u201d in a bullying tone, on camera in front all members. I gave him an odd look, kept cool and proceeded with the interview.

The position I was interviewing for was in the division of math, physics and astronomy (so cool!) and their style was very relaxed.  My interview lasted almost two hours, but the interviewer was very welcoming and it helped that their dress code is none.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, I came up short with some of the skills they needed, but overall, it was a basic interview.  \r\n\r\nQuestions asked: \r\n\r\nTell me about a particular achievement in your previous job? \r\nWhat are your weak points? \r\nHow do you deal with a manager that is practically non-existent? \r\nDo you work well on your own? \r\nTell me why you are the person for this position? \r\n\r\nHope this helps!
