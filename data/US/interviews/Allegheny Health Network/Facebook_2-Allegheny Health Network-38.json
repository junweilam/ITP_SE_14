I had a phone interview later that week that went through skills, education, professional goals and previous work history. She then sent her recommendation to the laboratory manager who contacted me and scheduled an interview. We met at the core lab down the street from the main hospital. The interview process lasted in total about 45 minutes where we discussed a lot of the same things as the phone interviewer had. The questions focused mainly on relationships with previous employers/coworkers, a gauge into personality compatibility, a history of how I had gotten to this point in my life and what motivates me in this line of work. The interview was half scripted and half conversational leading into a comfortable zone where it was just 2 professionals discussing common experiences. Afterward we toured the lab and said goodbye. I heard back from HR only 3-4 business days later with an offer.

He let me know that he received his resume, was looking to fill a position, and thought my resume was the perfect fit, which obviously made me pretty excited. I was on a long weekend vacation, so I could not discuss the position there, and we rescheduled for the next Monday to interview about the position. \r\n\r\nAs a preface, the position I applied for within this department was an entry-level position, consisting of minimal to moderate knowledge of SQL, advanced knowledge of excel, and Microsoft Office. Any data modeling experience was a bonus. I exceeded all of these significantly. \r\n\r\nSo I spoke with the manager of the department on that Monday, whom firstly was very distracted during the interview and largely seemed like a different person all together than previously. He evidently had a lot going on and forced the interview just to get it out of the way. The manager was speaking to people in the background while I was going through my experiences, and it was rather distracting because I didn't know if he was interrupting me to ask a question, or talking to someone in the background. But, at the time I just kept going with the process. The questions he asked towards the end of the interview about my technical background were absolutely absurd in comparison to some of the top consulting and IT firms I've interviewed with. For example, he was asking me (based on my resume experience) the exact updated model number of a program I used two years ago. Not something along the lines of what program or anything, but more so what version at that time was the most recently update of the program. Nothing about how I used the program, what I used it for, or what questions it helped solve for the project. \r\n\r\nI figured that was just a exploratory question, but he asked that about every one of my technical experiences. At this point I figured he just evidently did not care about the interview, and was trying to grill me. I enjoy hard questions because it provokes thought, but these were ridiculous. I tried describing my experiences with said programs, however was cut off each time by him to again describe what version numbers I used. I guess this could be useful in some scenarios, but these were his only questions about my resume. \r\n\r\nFinally he began asking if I had experience with programs that only a computer engineer or someone with a graduate degree in computer sciences would know. My resume evidently did not show these, as I applied to a position within the realm of my knowledge and skill set. \r\n\r\nHe then asked \"what if I told you weren't technical enough for the position?\", at which point I was pretty frustrated with a general waste of time. I then re-read the preferred requirements of the position from the job posting (I had pulled it up in front of me at this point) to him, and retorted with a similar question, asking him \"why you would hire a corporate real estate developer to build a shed in your back yard?\"(putting emphasis on the overkill for the requirements he listed in correspondence  for the position). I then explained why my experiences and technical skills were far enough along to thrive in this position. \r\n\r\nI assumed at this point I was eliminated from the position because I could not meet his outlandish technical experience for a pretty much entry level analyst role, consisting of using excel to gather data and write reports. This was overall the worst interviewing experience I have had, not because I couldn't answer the questions, but because the interviewer was overall just horrible. He was frustrated, seemed disgusted to have to interview someone, and worst of all was sidetracked. If this is a reflection of the company, I can't say for sure. However, this department did not seem to have its priorities straight at the time of the interview, considering the fact that he was the manager of the department and was so scatter brained. I've had hard interviews before that I was at least able to take positives away and appreciate my time for the interview, helping me develop more. This...this was just frankly a huge waste of time.", "Interview Questions": "Nothing that was of help to future interviewers...what version numbers my programs were, a lot of detail oriented things that seemed largely irrelevant.

I am not even upset that I was rejected because of how amazing it feels to be excited about a potential employer.  This is the organization for me.  There were three different phone interviews that lasted three months because of the holidays.  After three months, I was invited to meet two of the Procurement Directors who were very nice to meet.  They said I passed so they then welcomed me past the locked doors and I got to meet their supervisor (VP Operations), who I could tell immediately was an awesome person to work for.  He ended up being prior military, which is similar to me.  I passed his test and had someone from the Talent Acquisition Office set up a meeting to meet the executives of the proposed program office assignment for the position.
