I had a virtual interview with 2 woman & 1 man. The women seemed nice but the man kept interrupting my answers as if I shouldn't be given the time of day. He then asked why I left my most current job, the reason was on my resume right in front of him. Then he said, \"ugh I guess I'm just trying to figure out why you want to be in healthcare with no previous experience\" as if to say that my want to get into the healthcare setting was beyond stupid or that moving into a different career area is so off-the-wall. My resume is good & I am a good employee, I have never received a bad performance review. I was not applying to be a doctor, a nurse, something way out of my league, etc. I was reached out to on Indeed to apply and my skills matched the description almost 100% other than the fact that I would have to obtain a certificate within my first year of employment (which I was totally okay with). They must have liked what they saw, hence an interview invitation showing up in my email. I have never come across someone this rude and disrespectful while interviewing before.
