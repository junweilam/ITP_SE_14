I struggled finding anything on this particular position and because of that, I thought it'll be nice of me to share my experience for others applying for the Social Services Specialist I position. \r\n\r\nI originally applied for the position on Monday, March 27, 2017. On Thursday, March 30, 2017, I received an email from a recruiter informing me that she would like to schedule a phone screen as part as the first step in the interview process. \r\n\r\nToday, April 4, 2017, I had my phone screen at 1:30pm. The questions were very basic. She discussed salary and the next steps if I were to be selected to continue. After the \"phone interview,\" she asked if I was comfortable with the salary and informed me that my information would be passed off to the hiring manager. A few hours later, I received an email asking me to submit my references. \r\n\r\nI'm praying and keeping my fingers crossed! I really want this position. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I was told the starting salary is $21.00 for my 5 years of experience and having a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology degree (A bachelor's degree in some type of social service field is required for this position) \r\nThey also hire for Social Service Specialist II and I'm sure the pay will be higher. The requirement for that position is to have a Masters degree in some type of social service field (i.e, Psychology, Healthcare Administration, Counseling, and etc.) I graduate this June (2017) with my Masters of Science degree in Counseling, so hopefully I'm offered a position now and able to transition later. *Fingers Crossed*", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to leave your current job?
