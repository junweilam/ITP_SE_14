A big red flag was that they did not know who I would report to if hired. I was asked to interview with another person, a dean, over Zoom once I returned home because it couldn't be arranged during the 12 hour campus interview. A member of the search committee asked about my references but never called them, which is unusual and not typical for a professional interview. A month after the interview I emailed the chair, reiterated my interest, and asked about the search status. A full week later I received a reply from the chair that they were no longer chair (!!! shouldn't have been appointed chair in the first place then!!!) and that they had passed my email to someone else. I have not heard and it has been well over 2 months. HR should step in and establish professional norms for interviews.
