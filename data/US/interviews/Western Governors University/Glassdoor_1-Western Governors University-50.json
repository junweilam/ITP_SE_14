Three asked questions, while the other was in and out just observing. All of the questions were situational/behavioral questions, some similar to the ones asked in the interview with the recruiter. The interviewers were quite nice and it was better experience than I thought it would be. They even ended the interview asking me about interests/hobbies. They seemed nice. Well, time goes on and I didn\u2019t hear from them. Then on 9/1, one of the managers asked could I do a second interview with them on the 3rd.

First interview was a quick phone interview where they went over the basics of the position, pay, etc.  Second interview using Adobe connect.  This interview was very pleasant and professional, definitely made me want to be part of WGU.  A week later, I was interviewed by a Senior Program Manager and another Program Manager.  The Senior Program Manager seemed bothered by having to interview me, he clearly said that he would not be my Manager (which I was relieved) .  Although it was an Adobe connect interview, he was not dressed professionally at all.  He was wearing a baseball cap and a sweatshirt. I thought this was rather odd and inappropriate for an interview.  This interview made me very uncomfortable - neither of them smiled at all during the entire process. He even seemed to become angry with my response to one of his questions, which personally, to me was an outdated question.  I almost gave up and asked to end the interview at that time,  it was that bad.  Towards the end of the interview they asked for my references and asked if I would be available to fly out there for training with a specific date.  The interview appeared as if it was going towards the positive because of all the wrap-up information that was being asked.  They even reminded me that I would not be allowed to work any other jobs for a period of one year, and that there would not be any time off allowed during that time period either.  He wanted to make sure that I would be okay with that.  Later that evening, I was emailed a rejection, certainly not what I was expecting after gathering more information for him.  However, I was relieved, I didn't feel that this was a positive experience at all and the salary that was offered did not make up for the fact that I would have had to resign from my adjunct teaching job.", "Interview Questions": "How would you assess  your team?"}, {"date": "7 Mar 2017", "title": "HRBP Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Western Governors University (Tempe, AZ) in Feb 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied online and was sent a canned screening invitation a week later.

The first was for a mid level position - something like a course mentor, but I honestly don't remember the exact title. The interview was short and on site. I had 3 people asking me very basic questions and they described themselves as the \"old sages\" of Western Governors. They collectively had about 5-6 years experience working there, so that seemed like a bad sign. The questions were not difficult or especially specific, very general fare like \"describe a work conflict and how you resolved it.\" At the end of the interview it was indicated that they were very interested in moving forward with my application and I would hear something \"within a week.\" At least 2 months passed before I got a general \"thanks for playing\" email.\r\n\r\nAfter this less than stellar experience I was hesitant to apply again even though I saw what would basically be my dream job offered (I'm not including the title since it's very specific). I did not apply but was later contacted by a recruiter. He convinced me to send my CV to him and to schedule a time to talk about the position.

He told me he was passing my application on and that I would be contacted within 10 days and that if I hadn't heard anything by then I was supposed to let him know. 10 days passed with no follow up so I sent a brief \"hey remember me?\" email. No reply. It's been nearly a month since our first communication and almost 3 weeks since I was told I would hear something in no more than 10 days.

A third person was brought into that interview with some very easy technical questions that were related to the course content.\r\n\r\nA mistake was made in the next step where I was requested to produce a video but the topic was incorrect and for another course.

The better solution is to handle the interview process without any human contact and do it the same way they run the courses. Provide all the questions and let the candidates submit answers.

I scheduled a time to speak with the recruiter the next day.  She discussed the position and duties. The interview was very basic.

The recruiter indicated that I would be a good candidate and asked that I complete the application for the position on the WGU site.  Two days later I received a call back from the recruiter letting me know that I had been recommended for a second interview and to expect an email shortly.  Later that afternoon, I received an email for the second interview with the hiring manager. This was an Adobe session, so instructions were provided for logging in and checking your web cam.  This second interview was again very basic, I believe I asked more questions than the interviewer did.  This person asked questions like tell me about your experience and background and how they fit this position. \r\nSecond interview again was a very pleasant experience. We discussed the company culture and the importance of supporting student success. We discussed a potential start date if I were chosen and I was told I would get a follow up if selected. This manager did explain that there could be a third interview, but she was not sure  -- but I would definitely get a follow-up within the week. This second interview would turn out to be my final interview.Within a week, I received an email stating that I was being offered the job and to provide a time convenient to discuss the details.\r\n\r\nThis was another manager. This person congratulated me for being accepted officially offered me the job. Discussed all the benefits and gave me the salary. There was no negotiation necessary as the salary offered was exactly what I wanted and expected based on my research of the company. \r\n\r\nAll in all excellent experience. Everyone in the process were more than supportive in answering any and all questions I had.  This company really knows what they want and how to get it.

There was a phone interview, in person interview, and then another phone interview with different person. The worst part about the hiring process is the disfunction that the recruiting department has. I had to apply for the jobs three times for them to get their act together. The first time the lady I talked to on the phone really liked me and said she was going to call me back in a couple of days when she got back from her business trip to schedule an appointment for an in person interview. a few days passed and I hadn't heard from her so I called and left her a message. She got back to me a few days later and said she thought she had called me and left a voicemail to schedule an appointment, then proceeded to tell me she filled all of the positions and would call me when they were hiring again. I never heard back from her again. The next time a position opened my friend who works there went directly to the hiring manager with a referral for me so I wouldn't fall through the cracks again. He looked at my application and told my friend he would definitely contact me for an interview. Once again the job closed and he said he forgot to call. This frustrated me so I contacted HR and was handed a bunch of excuses about the previous incidents and the head recruiter I spoke with looked at my resume and said she would interview me personally the next time the position opened and make sure I was brought in for an interview with the hiring manager. Once again, I didn't hear back so I applied a third time and was finally interviewed the three times and hired. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm a student and wanted the tuition discount, I probably wouldn't have applied a third time. There was way too much hassle. Low and behold, I applied for a promotion and they somehow lost my new resume I submitted and went off the old one.
