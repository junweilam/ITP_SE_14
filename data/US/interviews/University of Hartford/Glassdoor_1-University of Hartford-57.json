These interviews, while positive, made it clear that I wouldn't be the right fit for the job.  But, the hiring manager did not respond to my follow-up emails, and Human Resources did not send a formal \"we've moved on\" email until ~4 months after. I'd like to think that HR dragged their feet and that the lack of response from the department itself was just to not step on toes in the bureaucratic higher-ed environment.
