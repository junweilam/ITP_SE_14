Between half a dozen interviews conducted over that time, I spent around 20 active hours interviewing, preparing, or completing materials asked for by the hiring committee. Two months into the process, I was informed that Sierra Club National required the chapter to keep the job posted until enough candidates of diversity had applied. I respected that choice, as the green movement absolutely has a diversity problem that needs addressing. I assumed things would move more quickly once they had gathered more candidates, however, that was not the case. The second to last interview I did included a one hour timed assignment which consisted of creating the chapter's fundraising budget, plans, and estimating the revenue generated, without any background information. All in all, an inordinate amount of work went into this interview process, only for the team to decide, in the end, to cancel the position and repost it at a higher salary in the hopes to attract better talent. Given the complete disfunction of the hiring process, I can't imagine a candidate with the skills they are looking for accepting a low wage and enduring such a tedious and convoluted process.", "Interview Questions": "Questions were fairly routine and related to experience organizing and running campaigns, lobbying, volunteer management, budget management, and fundraising/development experience and strategies."}, {"date": "30 May 2023", "title": "Operador Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Sierra Club (Buenos Aires)", "Interview Descriptions": "Buen trato buena calidad humana, buen feedback.

I was told that they were hoping for a fairly quick hiring process and we scheduled my phone interview for a week and a half later. The phone interview went really well! I felt like I connected well with the hiring manager and I was very enthusiastic and showed my excitement for the position. The woman was pretty professional over the phone and I got a great feeling about the office and work environment.\r\n\r\nThe phone interview happened on a Friday and I received an email Monday evening telling me two things: One that I was qualified for an in person interview (to be scheduled the following week on a Thursday or Friday) and that the hiring manager would get back to me by the end of that current week with a time. Secondly I was asked for a sample of my writing, which I wrote and sent back in a few hours after receiving the email. \r\n\r\nI waited and didn't receive an email by the end of the week and decided to follow-up on Sunday evening with an email inquiry. I was working full time and needed ample time to ask off for the interview that was to be scheduled. I did not hear anything the next day which was a Monday so I decided to give the office a call on Tuesday morning. No one answered so I left a message explaining that I needed to ask off that day if I was going to be able to participate in an in-person interview that Thursday or Friday. I waited and did not receive a phone call or email. Thursday came and went and on Friday I received a rejection email telling me that a lot of people had applied and they decided to go with a more qualified candidate, but that they hoped I would join in their fight by volunteering. They also informed me that because of the amount of applications they had received they wouldn't be able to respond to any application questions based on my application experience. \r\n\r\nI was honestly shocked by the lack of professionalism and communication by their office. I was told that I had qualified for an in-person interview, but wasn't given the curtesy of a time scheduled. At the time I was very disappointed because I thought I wanted this job more than any other job I had applied to.

What was also not listed at all in the job description was traveling to do these trainings. \r\n\r\nI was a bit caught off guard and I think that probably reflected in my interview.

Not once did I have any hesitation about the place, the job, or any of the several people with whom I spoke--all were completely cordial and professional. And combined with the fact that I particularly respect and appreciate what the Sierra Club does, I very likely would have taken the job had it been offered to me--assuming the salary had been adequate (see previous interview writeup).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even though they did not end up making me an offer, I would have still given the experience a positive rating if it weren't for one aspect. All along the process from beginning to end, whenever Drupal was mentioned I clearly stated that, though I had worked with other CMS's, I had not worked with that particular CMS before (although I assured them I would do all I could to come up to speed prior to starting if selected-- and they always said 'no problem'--including at the in-office interview; in fact they consistently seemed very positive about my suitability for the position. So when they informed me 2 weeks later that they had offered the job to someone else and I asked what took me out of the running, I suppose it was sort of a surprise and yet not a surprise that they said...Drupal!
