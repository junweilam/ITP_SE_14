If selected you receive a call for an interview. Interview is lengthy (mine lasted 90 minutes) & mostly asks pointless questions that don't tell them much of anything about you.

You must give the doctor your full medical history, including every medication you take. If you take medications you must bring the bottles to prove it & have your personal doctor fax a letter stating they write the prescriptions for you. You are grilled as if your medications make you a drug addict no matter what the medications are. You must submit to drug testing. You must also submit to blood work for cholesterol, diabetes & other testing. You must also have a PPD test. If you have any kind of arthritis or previous injury you are forced to see their specialist who does another exam to tell you whether or not he thinks you can do the job. If he passes you then you have to go to their physical therapy department & do another physical which includes walking on a treadmill for 30 minutes, lifting heavy weights, going up/down stairs, pushing heavy weights.
