They were very clear on the next steps for the interview process as well as the interview timeline which I really appreciated. I did not continue with the interview process but was informed that the next step would include a panel interview with the team members to discuss specifics about the role/job scope and a final interview with someone from Management to discuss soft skills and assess overall compatibility.
