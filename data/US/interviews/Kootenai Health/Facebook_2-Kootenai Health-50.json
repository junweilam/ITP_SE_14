The lady at the front desk answered said on the phone.  \"He just walked through the door now.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a panel interview with four people.

We then went over HR questions, and job related questions.\r\n\r\nI am a software developer by training, and while I don't have experience with \"Network Engineer\" I tried my best to have an conversation with the interviewers about the job.  I asked them technical questions about the nature of the  job, and what specific problems they have to overcome.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think I misread the nature of the interview.  The answers I got from work-specific questions were vague and evasive.  It felt like the interviewers were purposefully trying to tell me as little as possible about the position.  Through much prodding  I eventually learned that the position didn't require software development skills and that my interviewers were possibly not familiar with writing software.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the technical part of the interview centered around how I didn't have experience in this title at any of my previous jobs.  I grew frustrated and desperate.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the interview, I asked my \"co-workers\" as many technical questions as I could in an attempt to \"talk shop\".  Unfortunately the interviewers weren't able to answer my questions.  My questions centered mostly around the particulars of the software implementation such as database replication and failure modes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the interview.
