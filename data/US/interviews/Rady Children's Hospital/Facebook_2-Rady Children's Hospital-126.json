First, the hiring manager gave me the salary range in our first email communications before any interview.  I liked this because it was very straight forward and didn't waste time.  I was invited for an interview but did not expect a panel of ~8 people!  There was even someone on a speakerphone.  So intimidating right off the bat.  \r\n\r\nThe very first question came from the manager, \"So, why Rady's?\"  I can't stand this pretentious question but most of the big companies ask it.  It's so condescending like, \"We are so great here and please tell us some Godly things about our organization.\"  I really just wanted to answer, \u201cBecause I\u2019m looking for a job with better pay\u2026.\u201d  However I didn\u2019t and we moved forward.\r\n\r\nNext, one of the 5 tech\u2019s gave me a scenario question: \u201cPhone rings at 4:55 pm and it\u2019s a doctor in an operating room.  He wants you to help him with a piece of equipment that no one has ever seen before (including you).  As you get up to leave the CEO calls and has a powerpoint he is having trouble with and he is leaving for the airport in 15 minutes.  What do you do?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy answer: \u201cTell the CEO I\u2019ll be there in 10 minutes and go to the operating room.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey were silent.  The tech looked at his manager and she leaned towards me and said, \u201cAre you sure?  The CEO makes us money.\u201d\r\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe it, they would rather go to the CEO then an operating room WITH A CHILD on the table.
