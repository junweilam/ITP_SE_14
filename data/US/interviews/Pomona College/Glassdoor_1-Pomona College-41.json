It was posted in July and that's when I had my first interview with the head of the department via Zoom. Great initial convo and clear direction for the department. \r\n\r\nOne of the clear problems with this interview process was the lack of communication. Several weeks would go by with no response to emails, then you'd hear from them with another round of interviews scheduled, followed by 3 more weeks of silence. This went on from July - November.\r\n\r\nIn total, I had 8 interviews in a 4 month time span for this position.  3 interviews with the head. 3 group interviews and 2 single interviews. All an hour each via zoom.\r\n\r\nAnother off-putting thing was I heard from a former colleague that the head of the department had cold called one of my old jobs asking for candid feedback, but from someone who was not employed there when I was. Had this person asked, I would have been happy to provide my previous supervisors information. \r\n\r\nLastly, after being told by the head that they'd be making their decision on a Monday, that Wednesday I received an email from Pomona HR asking for my references. This was the first time HR was ever involved in the entire 4 month process. Again, complete silence after they were completed for 2 more weeks, only to find out I did not get the position. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, they have a huge communication problem and their hiring process needs to be severely reviewed. HR should be included much earlier in the process.
