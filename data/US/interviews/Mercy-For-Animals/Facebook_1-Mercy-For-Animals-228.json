I hadn't spoken to a human yet- so this felt very one-sided. But, I really respect the work being done by MFA so I decided to go for it. In reality, this work assignment was largely data entry and much of it did not seem at all relevant to the position I applied for, so I felt very caught off guard. \r\n\r\nMost organizations don't ask people to sink hours in to work tests unless you are a top candidate, but for all I know, there were hundreds of people going through the same process as me since MFA couldn't even take the time to have a phone call with their candidates. \r\n\r\nAfter all that, I received an automated email a couple weeks later stating that my cover letter and application have been reviewed and were not selected for further consideration.

Are you telling me that you didn't review my cover letter and application until I had already completed the 4-hour unpaid work assignment? \r\n\r\nI do believe in the mission of the organization, so I hesitated to write a harsh review of my experience.
