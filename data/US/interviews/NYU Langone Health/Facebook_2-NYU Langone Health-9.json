The first red flag was the way the recruiter articulated her email. I was a little thrown off by the casual \u201ccould you give me a call?\u201c To me it just felt like they were running out of applicant options and did not care but wanted to inquire about me anyway. Your professionalism speaks volumes. Maybe I am too particular, but this wasn\u2019t the worst part. Later in the day they give me a call to schedule a remote interview five days later. They were offering $21.57 per hour, but before I knew this I was asked what my salary requirements were. To be honest I wasn\u2019t prepared for the phone call so I ball parked and said $25 an hour to which the recruiter laughed and scoffed, and said it was not going to pay that much\u2014okay, fine. I should also mention that during the interview the recruiter asked a lot of questions that I had already answered in my application so my advice to you is keep a copy of your application on hand and remember what you put in your application should be what you say on the phone and during the interview. Also remember what your reason for leaving your previous positions were as they will ask you this during the interview although you already put it in your application. After that phone call to schedule the interview, I was met with a bunch of emails from the recruiter with a list of tasks to complete before the interview. These tasks included sending all education transcripts, downloading WebEx (by the way I highly encourage NYU to interview using zoom communications not WebEx), and completing a \u201cphase II\u201d application, which was so annoying to fill out because you have to manually type out your entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and if you don\u2019t do it in one sitting it does not save and you have to start over. Although the minimum education for this position is a high school diploma, I was still asked to submit college transcripts as well as a Microsoft Word version of my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 along with, get this\u2014 A whopping five references that needed to submit a Survey on my behalf. Honestly I thought this was so ridiculous for a part-time entry-level position.  I have family and friends in healthcare who only submitted two or three references for their higher up careers. \n\nWhat annoyed me the most was that the recruiter did not bother to really read my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and see that I was a recent graduate of a nursing program. During the interview, the questions were straightforward how ever I could tell with their tone they were not interested in hiring me after they just realized I was interested in becoming an RN. Then the interview became an interrogation about why I wanted this position if I was going to be an RN. Since you may be curious as well\u2026 in order to work as an RN in a magnet hospital you need to have a BSN which I am scheduled to start. As a recent nursing grad I know how expensive nursing school is and honestly just need a job. It would take me about two years to complete my bachelors so I wanted to work withing a hospital in the interim. I did not think this logic was rocket science for recruiters but apparently it is.If you had just paid attention to my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 you would have seen this and treated my application accordingly. Or they should have asked this in the initial phone call to schedule the interview. That would\u2019ve save me time and asking five different people for a reference. Additionally the interview was an hour with the recruiter, and scheduled for an hour with a member of the team in the unit I would have been working in. It was scheduled for two hours which also threw me off because I never in my life had a two hour interview for an entry-level position.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer"}, {"date": "31 Dec 2021", "title": "Staff RN Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 months.\u00a0I interviewed at NYU Langone Health (New York, NY) in Jul 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "Multiple stages.\nFirst interview was via phone to determine fit and areas/ units of interest.

After 1st interview was asked to complete a reference check via Skillshare (software where it asks for your reference email address and have them fill out a 25 question survey). I had to provide 5 reference where 3 has to be supervisors. Also, have to complete an internal application and do a ridiculous Microsoft office simulation test. Then was scheduled for a 2nd interview.\n5. The second interview was with leadership and HR. The leadership was professional, but HR wasn't. She asks me a series of behavioral questions which idk why since it's not like this position would work with HR. Then told me the next steps would be a reference check, but I had already submitted it. They ended up going with another candidate and I felt like I just wasted my references' time. \nOverall, they expect you to provide so much information before you are even extended a contingent offer. I think they should really switch the reference check to once an offer has been made like what all other companies do!", "Interview Questions": "Questions were about the position and your skillsets."}, {"date": "9 Jun 2021", "title": "Research Volunteer Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at NYU Langone Health", "Interview Descriptions": "It was very relaxed and informal, but it all depends on the PI.

The research labs for NYU Langone and the Medical School are in the hospital complex, so you need to travel to the East River waterfront from the 33rd Street stop on the Lexington Avenue subway line. The bus was taking an epic time to arrive, so I ended up walking. It was a long hike. I encountered a disturbing array of vagrants on my walk, which I later realized was probably related to the thousand bed men\u2019s homeless shelter right next to the hospital complex. I did not feel safe.\r\n\r\nThe interviews themselves were unstructured and consisted of an interview with the professor and a separate interview with a current research technician. I had done undergraduate research and had published citations, so the professor had already contacted my mentor for a reference.\r\n\r\nThe professor was really looking for someone to stay for the long term, noting that career research technicians were a standard arrangement in her native country. But since the position was funded by short term grants and was at-will employment, she couldn\u2019t guarantee any level of stability. I could be fired at any time for any reason - or no reason at all.\r\n\r\nShe was also concerned about my ability to work with the rodents used in her research. As my resume clearly reflected, I had no prior experience regularly killing, skinning, and dissecting rats. I honestly had no idea how I\u2019d react to being bitten or scratched by rats while performing experiments on them. \r\n\r\nThe research technician was an Ivy League humanities major who was preparing to apply to medical school. The professor told me she hired the research technician because of her elite credentials - in spite of her lack of scientific knowledge or experience. The current technician was a pleasant interviewer, but I had to lead the conversation.\r\n \r\nI never heard back. But given my lack of rat killing experience and the professor\u2019s fixation with graduates of elite universities, I wasn't surprised or disappointed.
