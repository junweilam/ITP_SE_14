I was called by a Human Resources representative at the end of August after applying for the job several times over the last year (I graduated from art college and figured MICA would be a good fit for me since I also worked in several departments at my art college). I called back twice the day I was contacted and reached the person's voicemail. I left two messages and received no calls back that day. I then called twice the next day, leaving messages again. None of my calls were returned. \r\n\r\nA week later I received an email from the representative that seemed as if they didn't receive any of my calls at all. She told me she was hoping to schedule a quick 30-minute call. We did the call the following day. She asked pretty generic questions and when I asked about the job she couldn't tell me much about what it entailed (having worked in HR, I understand you won't know every detail about every job description, but you at least have a decent idea). \r\n\r\nOverall, the entire process seemed a bit disorganized. My phone interview was July 24th and I didn't receive anything back about the job until today, September 4th.
