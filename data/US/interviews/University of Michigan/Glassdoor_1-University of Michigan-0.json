There were standard things the interviewer shared with me like the fact that in the event they chose me for the position I would have to submit to a thorough background check which would include reference checks and degree verification. What I like about UofM is that their hiring system is decentralized and you don't have to make it past an hr screening to get to the people you'll be working for. Resumes go directly to the hiring manager, so in my opinion you are more likely to get an interview if you have transferable skill sets that match the position rather than work history in a similar position.  Smart hiring managers can read between the lines and will understand how your skills can translate. After the phone interview I received an email that said I would be moving on the second round which was a face to face interview that would last an hour. At the interview I was required to bring a portfolio and I was asked behavior based questions as well as questions related to the specific position.

I asked how I could prepare for the interview and was told to read the department website, which I did, and thought I had as good a grasp of the organization\u2019s business as any outsider who had not done the job previously. \r\nThe interview, a week later, was cordial. The fact that the job I applied for promised to pay less than the salary I had earned in a term-limited temp position that had lasted 11 months at another university seemed to strike the interviewer as strange...as if there were no reason a person should seek a lower-paying job in a recession. I sensed that the recruiter was more interested in finding reasons to screen me out as a candidate than to explore how I might be able to help the organization. \r\nI had the feeling that an outsider applicant faced a significant acceptance hurdle in comparison to insider applicants, maybe in part because the job descriptions the university posts online mean something very different to insiders than to outsiders, and partly because there is a highly inbred culture there into which it is almost impossible to assimilate as an outsider with no background as a graduate or at least an employee who had worked there four years or more. Career-changers from other industries, regardless of experience and skills, don\u2019t seem welcome, and the heavy emphasis on diversity doesn\u2019t yet mean inclusiveness for people over 50.\r\nI received a call from the interviewer about a week later to tell me that I had not been selected for the next round, which would have been an interview with the hiring manager.

The University of Michigan is still a wonderful place to work andn offers so much opportunity, it's a natural choice.\r\n\r\nThe U of M website is nicely organized for applicants to upload and retain resumes for a variety of positions.  One difference compared to other company websites is that they request you have a cover letter as page 1 of the resume, saved as one complete document, rather than a separate cover letter document.  That makes applying a bit more time-consuming than on other company sites, but certainly worth the effort.\r\n\r\nI applied for this position via the U of M website and was contacted within a week to schedule a phone interview with the hiring manager (team lead of the group to which I had applied).  The phone interview was an hour long and I was impressed that the manager asked a wide variety of questions, not just the typical \"HR\" ones ... for instance, we talked about what I appreciate in a work environment, what stresses me out when working on a team - questions that dug into my motivation, values and real interests that attracted me to this position.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days I was scheduled for a group interview that would include giving a presentation, group Q&A and a few types of skills tests.  That interview was quite enjoyable - just the right mx of professional and personal interaction.  I could see the dedication these folks held toward their roles in this department and at the U, and I felt at home with these possible new coworkers.  Some \"HR\" style questions, descibe a situation and how you handled it, etc, plus more of the \"what do you value\" questions that I find so encouraging (a job is more than a paycheck to me).  All told, with applying, research, all interview time and preparation, I probably put about 12 hours toward this position (that's why I am rating the interview \"difficult\").\r\n\r\nIt took about 2 more weeks to hear that I was not selected for the position.  I have no complaints about this whole experience - other than not getting the job, I guess! - it was conducted with a great degree of care and professionalism.  They worked closely with me to explore the possibilities, which is all I could have asked for; in the end, they just felt I was not as ideal a candidate as someone else.

I was to bring a list of improvements for there website to the interview for their review. I did so & the panel interview seemed to go great. During the interview, I was asked to do an on the spot 60 second sell of the school. Good thing I'd done a lot of research on the school and had a lot of good points memorized, so I did well on that too. Immediately after the interview, I was taken to a computer and required to compose an email that was being timed at 30 minutes. I must have passed because a week later I got a call for the second interview.\r\n\r\nAt the second interview, which was also a panel, but of different directors, I was asked similar behavioral questions as before. However, there were some trick questions included, like \"what are your weaknesses?\", which I answered as being a compassionate person and concerned about helping as much as I can.

I should start this by saying that I have rarely failed to land either a second interview that I declined, or a job after an interview (not to be cocky - I don't always GET interviews, but when I get them I tend to do pretty well). I found a job that was perfect for my skills and qualifications, basically something I thought I was extremely qualified for, credential-wise. Honestly, I'd never found a job that fit my skills and interests so well. So after applying, I waited about 4 months to hear back. I'd written them off at that point, but when they called to set up an interview I went along with it. I didn't receive any of the emails they said they sent confirming time or location, but I knew where they were so it wasn't a big problem. Once I got to the interview, though,  things got... strange. I met with a few people at the scheduled time. I was asked two questions, total: 1) What did I think the qualifications of this position would be (and did I have them); and 2) what role did I have in my research abstracts. The tone of the second question seemed to imply that maybe I hadn't done what I said I had, which I really didn't appreciate in a prospective future team. The whole thing lasted literally about 20 minutes (after they'd told me to block an hour). They didn't ask when I was available to start or if I had salary requirements or anything (although they told me they were going to choose a candidate soon) and they were sort of short when I asked questions, and didn't do the typical \"any other questions?\" bit -- in fact, it seems like they were resisting questions. I couldn't tell walking out whether they'd had a candidate in mind the whole time but had to do the superficial interviewing of qualified candidates, or if they just disliked me on sight, but it was clear I was not getting a job with them. It's also possible that I was overqualified (turns out the job was much lower level than they had described in the initial posting), or who knows what else. Anyway, it was probably the strangest interview I've ever had. I never heard that the position was closed, either. Overall, given the lag time between the job open/close date and when they called me, I feel like there was probably an element of mandatory interviewing involved, but I was a little resentful that they would spend my time knowing that they weren't interested in me as a candidate going in. I could be wrong and maybe it was something I did, but I don't really feel like the interview lasted long enough for me to blow it.
