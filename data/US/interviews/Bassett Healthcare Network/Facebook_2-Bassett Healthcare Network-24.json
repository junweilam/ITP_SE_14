Went over resume quickly asked few ones such as why I applied there in first place.  Then asked what would I do if patient came in short of breath. My answer was immediately have them sit down. Go to them check them in; go back too see how doing than go see their provider and let them know. Because it could be short of breath from just walking in. They like answer. Said everything went great. Out door I went. Sent a follow up thank you letter to the HR person I'd been dealing with. Than nothing for 2 weeks. Finally got response email from a new HR person saying we picked another candidate but look on our website to see other positions.  Felt impersonal.

The position description lacked detail. I got a call back from human resources to schedule a phone interview. During the scheduled phone interview she went over the entire application to verify I had put down what the application stated. I explained my work experience. I had worked my way through college working three part-time jobs. Before going back to school I worked full-time for years. The human resources worker devalued some of my experience in a very condescending tone along with the fact that I worked three jobs part-time instead of a full-time job. She ignored some of my work experience because it was part-time instead of taking into account the hours/duration to equate to full-time experience. The position required five years\u2019 experience with one year deduction for having a degree. She told me I was not qualified and I should apply for a different job within the company or for the administrative I position. My work experience has been much more advanced and detailed than that of an administrative assistant, even taking into account just my full-time experience. I only applied for the position because jobs are hard to get around here and I recently moved back to the area. However, if she felt I was not qualified than my time should not have wasted, nor I do not think it was necessary to go over every question on the application either. I put it down. I signed it saying it was accurate. Manging an outlook calander and taking requests for scripts for doctors is well within the scope of my experience and not rocket science. I thanked her for her time and hung-up. I later called human resources and withdrew from all open positions I had applied. This is not the kind of company for which I want to work.
