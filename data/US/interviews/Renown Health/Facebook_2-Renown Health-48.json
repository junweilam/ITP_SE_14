She reached out to me via email and asked to schedule a phone screen, but it took three additional email correspondances from me to get her to respond and schedule the actual phone screen. During the phone screen she informed me that the position was vacant because of lay-offs.  I appreciated her candor, but that made me concerned for the future potential of the position, especially with Renown in the news lately. Never the less we set up a virtual interview for the next week. \n\nThe interview was scheduled by email and took place via microsoft teams. The interview itself was - for lack of a better word - tribunal style. The entire training department was on the call 6-8 people. They rotated through asking me questions. They were also 30 minutes late to the interview, whether this was due to miscommunication or technical difficulties I am not sure. I am sure this was the exception not the rule - but taken with how difficult it was to get an interview to begin with by having to reach out multiple times to the recruiter - it definitely felt like I was never seriously considered for this position. \n\nAfter it became clear that they were not interested in me for the position (a few weeks after i interviewed and had not heard back, and they re-posted the position) I reached out to the recruiter and asked for feedback from my interview for future similiar interviews.

The unpleasant conversation raises many concerns about mistreatment of employees, overworked long hours, and cheap pay.  \r\n\r\nBeware of cheap pay, mistreatment, and verbal abuse.  The Epic Environmental Engineer position has been posted for over 7+ months.  Qualified candidate spoke with recruiter, on the phone and there was aggression, berating, and combative arguments.  Red flag,  the job has been open for a long time and can suspect the issue is with the  organization and not the candidate?\r\n\r\nFirst time ever hearing a recruiter threatening and demanding a candidate force a verbal statement swearing to God to work cheap pay as permanent status employee and committing at least 3, 5, 10+ years at Renown Health.  Wouldn't a hospital want happy employees that are well paid to willingly continue to work for the hospital on their own free will?  Nobody can predict the future, health or longevity of life therefore cannot make that slave statement.  No one is at fault for unforeseen events like being sick, or having an emergency.  Is it fair for the recruiter to yell at a candidate because the recruiter predicts the candidate will quit?  Does the organization have a history of employees being hired and quitting shortly afterwards leading to high turn-over rates?  Do FTE permanent employees at this organization agree to slave labor contracts, working numerous years at 50-70 hours a week, cheap salary with unpaid overtime?\r\n\r\nAlso disturbing to hear a recruiter call a candidate names like being a liar, desperate, irresponsible and never wanting to grow up for working as a consultant in past employment history.  Why would someone  lie about being open to considering a permanent role with the organization?  How does applying for a job that was open for many months ago give the recruiter permission to call the candidate desperate? Since when did earning a living as a consultant become irresponsible?  Does it matter if a person obtained work experience doing environment strategy as a consultant versus working as FTE doing the same environment strategy?  Point is the candidate has relevant work experience, knowledge, and skills to qualify for the job.  Shouldn't job skills matter more than past income and job status as a consultant?\r\n\r\nWhy is the recruiter focused on talking about money and being jealous of the larger consultant pay?  Candidate is offering to discuss project timelines, expectations, and goals.  Yet those ideas are rudely ignored.  Candidate is willing to consider working, taking a pay cut to work and help the organization.  The recruiter at Renown Health quoted a salary number which is about 60-70% less than the market rate of what a consultant makes.  Candidate offered to help, willing to work on a solution with the organization because truly likes the job, has done it before, and helping the hospital benefits the local community.  The recruiter denied the candidate a chance to explain how to contribute and work together.\r\n\r\nRenown Health doesn\u2019t want any help or to fill this Epic Environmental Engineer position.
