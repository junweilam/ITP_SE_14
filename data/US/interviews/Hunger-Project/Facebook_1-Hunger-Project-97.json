The interview was relatively casual, with two [non-threatening] employees interviewing me together. They wanted to hear more about me, how I have arrived at this point in my career, and how my interests align with the organization and role [for which I applied]. Know your resume and your career well. For example, they asked me about my diversified background and how it all relates (i.e. what is the common thread in my skillset for all of these positions? what is my selling point?) My favorite question was what drives me when working in a position, and then what frustrates me the most in a position.", "Interview Questions": "None of the questions (most of which I listed already) stood out as difficult. But know yourself and the organization well, or else you'll have a hard time answering those specific questions."}, {"date": "18 Oct 2012", "title": "Program Officer Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at Hunger Project (New Delhi) in Jun 2010", "Interview Descriptions": "I was associated with the organisation previously doing various field work.
