It left me with a bad impression on the organization as they seemed so eager (seemed a bit desperate too) to get me in for interviews and they showed such enthusiasm at the prospect of me joining the organization. At one point, in between my 2nd and 3rd interview, they asked if I would like to be considered for a program manager role (a level above the program director role) and I said yes and would like to be considered for both roles and hope they picked me for the right role, given my experience and skill set.
