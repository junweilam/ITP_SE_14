They asked extremely hard questions not meant for an \"entry-level\" position. Whatever you do, I advise you to not even bother applying/interviewing here. Extremely unprofessional.

These days, HR is much more involved in pre-selecting candidates and managers only get pre-qualified applicants to choose from.

Otherwise, it really depends on who's interviewing you and what their experience is with interviewing candidates as some managers ask high-level -- and, to me, worthless -- questions such as, \"Where do you see yourself in five years?\", whereas other managers really base their questions on the candidate's resume and experience.  In my interview, the hiring manager had a pre-selected list of questions -- to me, a waste since you should really be talking to the candidate and trying to figure them out as a person and an employee.
