I initially received an email asking to fill out some basic questions of education and how many years of experience I had in different areas (ie: sql, excel, etc) and then was asked to send over my availability. I then scheduled a call with a recruiter for the next day. She was nice but instead of the typical phone screenings I have had in the past of asking me to tell her about my experience and background, she re-asked me the questions in the email, with somewhat awkward silence in between each question. She then went on letting me know she is inputting my info in their 'calculating system' which will better identify the salary expectations for my experience and how it aligns with this role.  Are we seriously at an age where we are now using tools to give a rough estimate of how much you think someone is worth? And without even asking a high level overview of their background? She never once even told me any information about the position or the team itself. If this interview process at Banner Health is a standard process, and you plug in years of technical experience into a tool to give you an estimate of how much you're willing to pay someone, I personally want nothing to do with an organization with such a flawed system. Companies should 1.) provide the potential candidate a chance to give some sort of background/ experience 2.) look at someone's potential and include that as a factor. I also gave this information initially in my email when I was first contacted so not sure why I had to re-iterate my information, wasting mine and the recruiters time. My education apparently also had a factor in the process. We are living in 2020 and I graduated college 6 years ago. A lot of people have a degree in something completely unrelated to what they are doing now. Why wouldn't a company look at direct experience opposed to a college degree?
