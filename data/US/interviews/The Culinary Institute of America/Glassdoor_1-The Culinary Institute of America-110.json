The lack of communication and adherence to timelines was a big red flag - I lost a lot of respect for the institution through the process. Submitted an application in the fall. Had a phone interview in the spring, was told I would get followup in a few weeks, did not hear anything for two months, and then an interview was scheduled. Completed the working interview, which turned out to be a group interview (4 hours). Was asked to reschedule the rest of the interview- was told I would be brought in the following week. No contact for a month. Completed the final process and was told I would hear within a month- did not hear anything for three months. Was asked to repeat the interview process, and completed the 4 hour process for a second time. Was told the timeline to choose a candidate was a month. Did not hear for two months, and was sent a standard email from the school informing me that they would not be moving forward. No one at any point acknowledged the fact that they consistently did not follow up or ever keep to their timeframe through the process. A heavy time commitment, with very few clear parameters for judging. Several instances of sending follow up emails that were ignored.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work at the Culinary Institute of America?"}, {"date": "9 Dec 2021", "title": "Grant Writer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at The Culinary Institute of America", "Interview Descriptions": "A 20 minute introductory phone call/ interview.
