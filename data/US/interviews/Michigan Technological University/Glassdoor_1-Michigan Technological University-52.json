It progressed to an informal phone conversation with the Director of Admissions and another important decision maker from a different department who held the job years ago in January 2017. From there, I was told to have an informal meeting with a potential team player near my area.  (Both times I was also told that these \"informal\" meetings weren't interviews, however, whenever one is meeting key personnel that can influence the decisions affecting your employment one must realize the interview has already begun.)  Following that meeting, I was contacted by the Director with the position description, agenda of my time on campus, and the presentation I had to make my own for prospective students and their families.  I had two weeks to prepare. I was on campus from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. interviewed by two separate panels: one from the department and the other department heads I would have to interface with, had lunch with current students, took a tour of the campus, wrote a plan of how I would contact and recruit students for the rest of the 2016-2017 school year, and ended with a 10-15 minute presentation.  I also had breakfast off-campus prior to my official interview with the Director's supervisor/boss. The breaks were short, and I used them to contact my family who traveled with me.  Unfortunately, I later found out that it was frowned upon to use my cell phone during my breaks, and it was one of the things listed as a concern for job performance. Though it was a pleasant experience on my end and the feedback I received from the student and the department heads were positive, I apparently failed to connect with or prove to the Director that I could do the job even as a temporary assignment (because it was to be on a trial basis). I was told by the Director's boss that the Director passed on filling the position on a temporary basis for the remainder of the school year and would make the position available to the public for the 2017-2018 school year.", "Interview Questions": "Say you prepared for an event to meet students and family with a RSVP list of 20 but only two students showed up, would you consider it a failure?
