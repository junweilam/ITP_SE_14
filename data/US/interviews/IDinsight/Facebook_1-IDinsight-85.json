All-in-all, I think IDinsight staff is extremely insincere, and insensitive about the anxieties that goes through applicants' minds.  \r\n\r\nThe process begins with a detailed form about yourself, followed by a math test that lasts about an hour. After that, they have two interview rounds. The first interview is more technical - wherein you receive a few case studies that should not be difficult if you know about basic econometrics and RCTs (sampling, stratification, spillovers). They also ask you to solve two basic algebra questions towards the end as well. The second interview is behavioural and so far the weirdest one where they ask you a bunch of questions that I feel should have no bearing on your candidature. It is also clear that they have not changed their interview process in the five-six years of their existence. The questions are quite honestly, annoying, and unsettling. \r\n\r\nThe interviewers were quite honestly, disrespectful and rude. There is hardly any need for these kinds of interviews to be stress interviews  (they are on Skype and also, this is not a management position which requires you to test how we respond to stressful situations). The stress interview format does one thing and one thing only: it unsettles and unnerves you, reduces your confidence, makes you nervous. One of the interviewers argued with me over a statistical technique I use at my work nearly everyday - I am not sure whether it was an interview technique to pry into my behaviour, but it reflected badly on them because she was incorrect but almost petulantly insisted that she was correct.  At one point, an interviewer asked me about Stata commands I use (totally a wrong format.. the interview is verbal. If you want to test my coding skills, take a Stata test?) \r\n\r\nThe interviewers, I noticed, were also not at all aware about their own recruitment process but wanted to know what questions I have had (both their answers: \"good question, but I am not sure\"). At one point, one interviewer told me that she was not sure what the entire recruitment process is but she did know how it was three years ago. What should I do with this information and how is it relevant? Shouldn't somebody who is making huge decisions about candidates know what processes they are going through?\r\n\r\nIDinsight might think that their processes are standardised but they are not. A colleague of mine who similarly interviewed and ultimately got the offer had a kinder, more professional interviewer. If you aren't asking the same questions from all candidates, how are you hoping to judge how fit they are to the organisation? My conjecture is also that your previous experience and education has a sheepskin effect for IDinsight. You'll be at a significant advantage if you 1) went to a top school 2) worked for organisations that are universally known.\r\n\r\nThey also ask for references as a part of the recruitment process. References are a form that your referees fill which are again, very weird arbitrary questions that a referee should not reduce their reference to. I also understand that references are a part of an overall 'score' that they ultimately judge you on. References to me, although a significant part of the recruitment, should not be competitive. I have different referees, other candidates have different referees. You cannot compare mine against theirs. It is pointless and unfair. It is also a waste of time if you are not going to recruit most of the people you are asking references from. \r\n\r\nI really regret the time and effort that went into a fruitless recruitment process. Honestly, I would be upset at the lengthy, circuitous process it took had I received the offer. It also is terribly upsetting to know from an insider that there isn't much deliberation in the recruitment process either - just some matching of scores from each round. It should not take three months.", "Interview Questions": "First interview is almost entirely technical which I have detailed above.\r\n\r\nSecond interview is behavioural: here are some of the questions\r\n\r\n1.

The interview times are still indeed a bit odd (early morning) but it comes with the nature of the work. The interview itself was quite straight forward. Most of the cases described earlier on Glassdoor still applied (textbooks). The interview ended with two quantitative problems: a compound interest and a distance formula problem.  I was free to use whatever resources available (Excel, etc). I didn't leave this interview extremely confident but received the invite back for round 2 within a week and a half. This time, I interviewed with one of the leaders from another division on Skype. This interviewer was a bit more stoic and I could often tell the mood was not as optimistic. The Stata questions and intense skill focus detailed in past reviews is no more. Questions were mostly behavior - one: \"Why International Development\", was a repeat from before. Still, there were 3 more brain-teaser like algebra problems toward the end of this one as well (salt solution using different sized containers) and a seemingly simple case study on whether a group of farmers should a adopt a new crop recommended by researchers, but that they believe to be unsuited for the climate.

They retrieved 2 months later to contact my references. A week later, they inform me that they can't make an offer right now. I asked for a feedback to which they blatantly refused. I pushed an employee in the organization to push for the same but they were rude to his requests as well (they'd respond only if they have a reason to reject me).
