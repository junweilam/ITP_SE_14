I wasn't given a job description and it was very informal; I was told to wait a month or so until they had the job nailed down and see if I went further in the process.  That was July.  I kept in touch and tried not to call too much; about every couple of weeks at first.  I was continually told to hold on, they were still considering me, but the job was up in the air.  By October I was still kind of hoping it was a possibility but checked back less often.  Finally after we got back from our Christmas vacation I called to see what was up.  By that time I had pretty much decided to forget about it, but just wanted to close the loop.  I was finally told that they had actually reorganized the team and there was no job available as they had thought.  I don't have any sour grapes but the process was extremely long and it seemed as if no one could make a decision.  I'm not sure I would enjoy working in that type of environment, so it's probably all for the best.", "Interview Questions": "I remember being asked to explain about my career path, and I think it was stated something like, \"What's your story?\"  Which seemed vague but was good-natured.
