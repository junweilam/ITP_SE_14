I was very excited and had two consecutive interviews the same week. First was a screening phone interview with a recruiter in which I explained that my unemployment gaps because of COVID and I decided to switch my career path (hence, that\u2019s why I am applying to jobs). The person was unprofessional when I spoke about what I was doing while I didn\u2019t  have a full time position for over year. I explained that I work as a freelancer on projects and volunteer my time while extensively looking for a job. Frankly, I was disappointed but still wanted to continue with the interview. Looking for a job in 2021 and then now 2022 has been emotionally draining and everyone seem to be ghosting candidate (at least my experience so far). I kept my cool and then they contacted me the next day for a meeting for the following day with the hiring manager and I was very excited speaking to them and moving forward within the process. The interview went well from what I can say, they seemed  to be impressed with my background and career. The hiring manager informed me that I should hear back in two weeks since they were other interviews scheduled with other candidates (fair enough). I expressed my enthusiasm and I didn\u2019t followed up until two weeks after the interview. I followed up with the recruiter and they  told me that they haven\u2019t heard anything from the hiring manager and they will keep me posted. I was never contacted for an update and basically they\u2019ve ghosted me. I understand that I might not be the right candidate for everyone but I am a person who took time out of my schedule to apply, speak to the employer over the phone, and prepared for the interview. The very least they could do is keep me updated after the interview. After this experience, I wouldn\u2019t be interviewing or applying anymore to this company.
