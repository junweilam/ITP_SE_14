I was really impressed with the way they leveraged technology to allow a panel member to join remotely, but still create a welcoming, pleasant experience for the candidate.  I was invited to a second interview at CCAH headquarters which took place 3 weeks after the first interview.  The panel for the second interview panel included the hiring manager, the Talent Acquisition manager, another HR manager, and the HR Director.   With over a decade of experience interviewing employees, I must say that I was very impressed with the quality of the interview questions.  They were the best that I'd ever seen from any of the industries I've worked in.  Questions were thoughtful, relevant, and designed to really make you think and draw out the desired skills and experience.  Behavioral, situational, and case-related.

Questions are set by the hiring manager at all three levels but reviewed and approved by human resources.  Many questions for management are about cultural fit and for technical positions about specific skills sets defined in the job advertisement.  Health care experience, like many basic skills are a boilerplate add on to all staff requests.\r\n\r\nAt a second interview, consider asking questions about work environment and specific cultural personality of your department (for example flexible hours, independent decision making, supervisors view and requirements to successfully pass the probationary period, what is considered a successful year to obtain high evaluation scores).
