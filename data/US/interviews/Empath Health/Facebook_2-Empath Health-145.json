I am very fortunate in that my staffing agent is awesome and very helpful as I have certainly heard horror stories, but thankfully I do not have one myself. She really helped the process move quickly (especially quickly for something in the healthcare industry).\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a phone interview with who would be (and currently is) my manager. A standard phone interview, thankfully my manager is a dog lover because my dog was causing quite a ruckus while I was on the phone. All questions that were asked were fair and to be expected, given the position.\r\n\r\nSecond came an in-person interview with my manager and the director of the affiliate. We sat at a small round table in the director's office - a very comfortable atmosphere as it didn't feel extremely judgmental or like there was some strict hierarchical dynamics at play. Big fan of this style of interview and should I ever be in a position to interview others, I will do it like this.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, I was shown around the office in which I'd be working if I got an offer. Very comfortable, laid back, conversational interview at this point. Spent about a total of 2 hours at the campus.\r\n\r\nI was drug tested even though it was not a clinical position. The test results were clear but the processing of the test took several days, leading me to start on a Tuesday instead of a Monday, and thus lengthening the overall process.", "Interview Questions": "What is a situation in which you had to handle a disgruntled or angry customer?
