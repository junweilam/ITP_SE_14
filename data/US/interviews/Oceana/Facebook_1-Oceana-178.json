I met initially with the hiring manager for what I expected to be a casual networking chat. Turns out it was a job interview (unbeknownst to me). Although I wasn\u2019t aware of an opening (and none was listed on the website), I was happy to discuss a new position the hiring manager clearly thought would be a good fit for me. I left feeling excited about what sounded like a great career move and confident I was a top candidate for the job.\n\nThe hiring manager quickly arranged for me to interview one on one with each member of team. In one day I interviewed back-to-back with four people in person and one via Skype. I had another Skype interview the next day and a phone interview with the final team member the following Monday. So seven people in three days. The manager was also in a rush to have me submit a formal application (including references) and take a writing test (very straightforward and not too time-consuming).\n\nEveryone on the team had done their homework and came to the interviews prepared with specific questions for me based on my resume. They were all friendly and professional. I liked them and believe I would have enjoyed working with them. While they asked about how my previous job experience would inform my work at Oceana, each of them zeroed in on my communications style and ability to work well with others. The subtext was unmistakable: they were frustrated because their manager didn\u2019t communicate with them.\n\nAfter this flurry of activity, nothing. The next step was supposed to be a final interview with the president  of Oceana and the Comms VP, but all I got for three weeks was crickets. I finally had to contact the hiring manager myself to ask what was going on. That particularly bothered me\u2014it was their responsibility to communicate with me, not the other way around. I emailed him in the morning and didn\u2019t get a response until after 6 pm\u2014telling me they were no longer going forward with creating the position!

The NGO is in a very unique position: \"What do we do with a large sum of money?\" They grew so fast, they literally do not know how to manage the organization. But first, let me start with HR and the phone screen. \r\n\r\nThe HR lady was good to work with, transparent and communicative. After our Skype call, I was invited to interview in Washington DC for the two roles. I should note that Oceana did cover my travel costs which was nice. I met with more than 7 people, most of which were completely unprepared. One meeting I had was with one person in a room, and two more on a skype call and they did not or could not get Skype to work, so that ate 30 minutes into our call. Only one person asked my why I was passionate about wanted to work with them. Most of the employees categorized their work place as, \"organized chaos.\" When interviewing with someone for the OPM role, we did not even discuss the role, which was bizarre. \r\n\r\nProbably the highlight (low-light?) of the day for me though was interviewing with the COO. I knew the whole day was a waste of time when I walked into his office and he said, \"So, what's your name and what role are you interviewing for?\" We then spent about 30 minutes talking about processes - clearly that was his niche but not necessarily what I would be doing in the roles I was interviewing for. I asked him what his favorite part about his job was and he replied, \"Winning.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there is the apparent main problem with the org: With their Harvard and McKinsey mindset, management is stifling their employees and any possible creativity. After I left, I knew I wasn't going to work there, even if offered the role. I kind-of felt bad for the employees and frankly, the whole organization, with such a great mission, could be run better.", "Interview Questions": "Besides the normal interview questions, my favorite was, \"So, what's your name and what role are you interviewing for?\""}, {"date": "26 Jan 2021", "title": "Director De Comunicaci\u00f3n Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Oceana (Ciudad de Mexico) in Jul 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "Fue muy bueno, tuve entrevistas por los directivos en M\u00e9xico, luego con dos personas v\u00eda zoom en la sede de EU, despu\u00e9s una en persona con el director general de la oficina en M\u00e9xico.

They don't like to have you coming back for multiple interviews but that also means you have to come in for about 3 hours and meet with what seems to be the entire company. They are pleasant to talk to. The manager said she would get back to me by the end of the week but actually didn't get back to me until a full 12 days later. She then said that unfortunately she could only afford to have someone for about 40K less than what I was asking for because they are a non-profit. Which I would of understood if we hadn't talked about salary in the initial phone screen. I was a bit confused as to why they would waste time on both sides. Long interview but way off on salary.
