It went very well, she was nice and created a warm environment. \n\nRed Flag 3 - 2nd interview was scheduled outside of working business hours \n\n2nd Interview - One of the coldest interviews I've ever had. The program Director and the Senior TA conducted what came across as an interrogation. They fired questions at me with no option for conversation. I was told I would have time to ask questions at the end, but the  Senior TA repeatedly took over the interview by asking additional questions after they agreed to turn the remaining time over to me. \n\nThis indicated they had no interest in my perspective, or alignment concerns as an applicant or a potential colleague. The vibe was condescending; and seriously not appreciated. I was a bit shocked considering they design workforce development programs, but on reflection, it makes sense. This division of IRC is OLD world Economic Dev wherein workers are meant to feel grateful for any old job that comes along, no matter the environment or benefits. \n\nRed Flag 4 - I had 2minutes to ask questions. When I asked what their strengths and areas of improvement were (as a team) they both intentionally skipped the second part of my question and said they \"had to think about it\". If an applicant can be asked this during an interview, they should expect the same. My question clearly rubbed them the wrong way, as the Senior TA looked visibly displeased. \n\nIf you can't in good faith reflect on the areas your team needs to improve, that indicates a serious lack of self awareness or conscious ignorance. \n\nRed Flag 5 - No POC on the Workforce team \n\nFinal Red Flag - The job is listed as a PO but the duties are clearly that of a Director. The Director is always traveling, so it's clear that the POs are doing this work in her stead.  This isn't an issue if the job is getting 90K+, but their budget is 70-80K. \n\n", "Interview Questions": "Way too many to recount.

I was also requested to provide 4-5 references. \r\n\r\nAfter spending an immense amount of time going through this process over the course of two months, I was initially told I was the final candidate and that an offer would be sent shortly.  However, at the last minute I was contacted by the recruiter to say that they would no longer be able to accommodate me working remotely and the position had to be based in NY.  During each of the THREE interviews I was assured that working remotely (from another state) would be totally fine. I was told this was a shift made by senior leadership. I'm not sure how HR or the hiring manager didn't know about this shift beforehand. Luckily I had not given notice to my current job, otherwise I would have been in real trouble. This was my dream job, I was so excited to work with both the hiring manager and director. I found it really disappointing that neither the hiring manager or director reached out to me to apologize about stringing me along through this process out of respect for my time. I only received a curt email from the recruiter. It was a difficult experience that  has affected my mental health.\r\n\r\nI have worked for the IRC in the past and I have tremendous respect and admiration for the organization. However, the treatment I received during this interview process was incredibly disappointing. I would also caution those considering working for the organization that they are sorely behind in their DEI practices. While they do hire diverse candidates for the lower levels of management, representation at the leadership at the HQ level is lacking.  There are incredibly limited opportunities for growth which is  why I left the organization initially, and contributes to high turnover. I'm also not sure how I feel about the organization being based in one of the most expensive cities in the country... how does that help to recruit diverse talent? As a person of color (and first generation immigrant) myself, I am already struggling to make ends meet where I live currently. Moving to NY would not be an option for me or my family. Furthermore, consider the immense overhead costs incurred by having a NY based HQ office. The org is extremely hierarchical and has not been receptive to feedback in my experience. Again, it pains me to say this, because I really have so much respect for this organization's mission. I hope that they review their hiring and DEI practices soon and are more transparent about changes they make and the breakdown of diversity at all levels of the organization.", "Interview Questions": "Standard interview questions about work style, some scenario based questions."}, {"date": "16 Apr 2022", "title": "APA Healthcare Navigator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at International Rescue Committee", "Interview Descriptions": "I only got an interview when I reached out to HR.

The person I spoke to was not the hiring manager, but someone on the same team who I think would have been horizontal to the position I was interviewing for. She gave me basic details about the job and asked if I had questions -- all the questions she asked me were very soft -- when I could start, and whether or not the salary range would be a problem, etc. Nothing substantive. The position was very in line with my skill set but the pay was significantly lower than what I am currently making in a city with a 30% higher cost of living than where I live/work now. So...no thanks. But I thought it would be good practice to go ahead with the second interview, and I wanted to ask about the possibility for advancing within the company to see if advancement opportunities might be worth the low initial wage. \r\n\r\nThe second phone interview was with both the hiring manager and the first person I'd interviewed with. They both seemed very friendly, and interview questions were very basic....career goals, strengths/weaknesses, etc. I asked some questions about their structure, how decisions were made, advancement...I have a good bit of non-profit experience doing very similar work and none of their answers were very satisfactory to me and I that may have showed in my response. Seems like a big out-of-touch non-profit with bad management issues, poor planning/structure, very top-down and slow moving and high turnover. They were nice and enthusiastic, seemed smart and passionate....but that is not enough to make me want to work for that kind of non-profit again. \r\n\r\nAnyway, they told me a specific date that the final interviews would be happening and that they'd call me soon and let me know either way. They never called again. \r\n\r\nI've done a lot of hiring, and I think this is really bad form. I always send rejection letters to everyone, and even if you get so many applicants that you can't do that, I cannot fathom not sending some sort of notice to someone that you interviewed TWICE.
