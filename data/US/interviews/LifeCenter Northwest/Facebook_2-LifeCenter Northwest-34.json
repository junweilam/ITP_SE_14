So when I secured a \"phone interview,\" I thought it'd be a cursory 10-minute conversation with a person who had no idea what I actually do. I was wrong. It was a thorough interview, where I gave information and also received information about the company. They realize that the organization has to be a fit for you and your values, not just for the skills they are seeking. My phone interview was about 30 minutes in length. I actually complimented the recruiter for her thoroughness because I felt that she cared enough on behalf of the organization to find the right person.  I had a second interview with the hiring manager and a vice president. Then, I was invited to a third interview with three panels of employees. The third interview with three panels is common practice; they are hiring for cultural fit as well as for skills. Each interview, I felt that people genuinely cared about me. They were gregarious and fun, but also passionate about the work.", "Interview Questions": "Which of the organization's values do I most resonate with and why?
