[[{"date": "18 Feb 2023", "title": "Software Developer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Elevation Church in Jun 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "Numerous Personality Test Batteries (I would say at least 5) as well as competency batteries (reading/writing/math) as well as several online form style and hirevue style recording interviews. Additionally for Software Engineer roles you have a take home project (1-2 days to complete). Then if you make it past this 'big tech' style interviewing process, you have a on-site or virtual on-site interview that lasts all day 8am-4pm. Overall I would not recommend applying to Elevation unless you are 100% about committing your life to Elevation Church and staying there for a very long time. They made it abundantly clear that it will be stressful and the remedy to this stressful and seemingly toxic work environment will be to \"remember your why\". The salary offer for full-stack work was pitifully low at 70k with an upwards cap of 90k, and for a mega-million church that depends heavily on it's engineers and IT personnel, it didn't quite sit right with me how they wanted to emphasize that \"people take pay cuts all across the world to join elevation\". I was also told that elevation isn't a place for people to come and go (specifically under the context of career advancement) and that they \"aren't here for that\". This to me conveys that you are there to serve Elevation church, and it is not there to serve you and your needs whatever they maybe. Additionally it conveys the message that your ministry service isn't wanted unless you're in it for the long-haul. Throughout the process they bragged about only working 4 days: Mon-Thurs. while specifically, if not strategically omitting the fact (until the last on-site interview) that you are \"expected to volunteer\" at the church on Sunday. I think it's pretty reasonable that any Christian working at a Church, and attending the Church would most likely end up volunteering, but the way they hid this fact until the last interview, and phrased it as \"you are expected to...\" rather than \"required to...\" just seemed like a very duplicitous and shady. In the end I prayed for the Lord to close the door, so that there would be no ambiguity in whether I should accept an extended offer or not. He did, and I'm grateful. I love Elevation church, I still watch every Sunday, but my advice to anyone looking to work there as an engineer would be to closely consider whether you feel called to Elevation, because they will definitely want you to feel called, be 100% about elevation, take paycuts or a low salary offer, work an unspecified length of volunteer hours, and more to be considered a cultural fit/hire. To Elevation, I would just suggest being more transparent with expectations, as well as focusing on your employees health and satisfaction as well (not just the church congregation). Telling employees they will get burnt out, but should take their \"off day\" to unwind, or \"remember their why\" is a very disrespectful way of treating them.", "Interview Questions": "Many behavioral questions, why elevation church, etc. Your typical behavioral interview questions.
