I never received a confirmation, so when I called to confirm the week before the interview, I was transferred through offices until I was connected with someone who -- when asked to confirm the interview -- blurted out \"Oh, I thought that position was already filled.\"   That's when I knew it was a dirty search and an internal candidate had already been promised the position.   At this point I was so amused I went forward with the \"interview\".   Arrived on campus only to be told to \"Please take a seat and wait while they find the search committee\".  An hour later, I was escorted into a conference room in which two students and an assistant student activities director were seated.   Apparently, they were the search committee -- never mind that the position had nothing to do with student activities.   Amused, I answered their questions even though the questions had nothing to do with the job to which I had applied.   No one wrote down a word.  Not surprisingly, I did not get an offer and but the next week received an email that someone else had been hired for the job.   No surprise there.
