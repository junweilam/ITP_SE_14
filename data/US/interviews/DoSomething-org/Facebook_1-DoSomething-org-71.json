Oh, and let me know what this meeting was regarding. \"\r\n\r\nI replied to new email address with \"I was scheduled for an interview and it was for (..job title..). I would be glad to forward the email chain between me and \"so-and-so\" which included my cover letter.  Please let me know when we can reschedule. Thanks so much for getting back to me about my interview today. Looking forward to hearing from you.\"\r\n\r\nNo reply email, no phone call, no interview rescheduled.\r\n\r\nNo idea what happened to the 3-4 people I was supposed to meet with in my \"group interview\".\r\n\r\nThis experience reiterated why I ALWAYS confirm my interview appointments the day they are scheduled regardless of who the employer is.", "Interview Questions": "No idea.
