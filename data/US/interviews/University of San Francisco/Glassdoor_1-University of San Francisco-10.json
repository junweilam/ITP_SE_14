I got a good feeling from all of them, but again didn't feel the hiring manager was a great listener. But overall, it went well and they told me about next steps to meet upper management, so I thought I would hear from them soon. I immediately followed up with each staff member individually with very thoughtfull thank you emails detailing our discussions, to which not even one of them replied...I found this awkward and off-putting considering what seemed to be a strong interview, to not even send a quick reply...I know university hiring processes can be slow, so I waited 3 weeks after not hearing back to confirm my interest, let them know I had another potential offer and needed to respond within a week and politely asked for a status update...a week later and still nothing. I just find it very unprofessional, not in standing with the university's mission and misleading, specially when you are working in Student Services where you need to be responsive and are not allowed to just ignore emails...but it's better to see what kind of people you're dealing with before hand and realize that first impressions are not always sincere.", "Interview Questions": "How would you guide an international student to package him/herself against US students applying for the same positions?"}, {"date": "27 Sept 2015", "title": "Graduate Research Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 days.\u00a0I interviewed at University of San Francisco (San Francisco, CA) in Jan 2014", "Interview Descriptions": "Initial phone interview, then in person.
