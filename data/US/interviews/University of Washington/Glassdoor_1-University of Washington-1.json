Easy interview because the interviewers have low standards for hiring. If you work here, it'll probably be amazing because from what I've gained from the interview process, there seems to be a lot of thumb twiddling all day. Interviewers really liked to point out how slow moving UW is and the work life balance is amazing, insinuating that there's more life than work. A lot of the interviewers here seems to be taking refuge from the high stress environment of working in the tech industry, so I'd imagine this place is great for doing little to nothing and getting paid. After the two interview rounds, I hope you have enough time and money to live off of if you're unemployed because you will wait from at least a month and a half to, in some cases I've heard, up to a year before you hear an update. I was treated with unprofessionalism but respectfully followed up every week for over a month. Today, I received an offer from another company and let them know because they told me to notify them of any timing constraints and was rejected right away despite last week receiving an update that I am still being considered. I am not sure what they could have been doing for over a month instead of hiring someone and putting them to work. The last response I received gave off the idea that they were never really planning on hiring anyone. The position preaches that they're looking for industry talents to bring into academia where there is usually a lack of technological industry standards. Yet it's ironic that they hire in ways that are the complete opposite of industry standards. I wanted to work here because I thought the mission contributes to changing our understanding of the universe but unfortunately it's gate-kept by bureaucracy that doesn't make sense. My advice to the department is to not forget that the people you're interviewing have lives and bills they need to pay. If you leave people hanging for too long, they'll move on to better jobs and you will never hire anyone and just waste money and time instead of using what little funds UW has (after the administration sucks out most of it out of the wallets of students) to improve the lives of students on campus. It's just hiring someone for a job. How hard can it be that you need to take months to a year to process it? Universities are privileged with some important work for public organizations working in the discovery of the universe and the most meaningful work this world has to offer that could improve the lives of billions. Hoping the money that comes from tuitions and the government will be put to better use for that cause, starting with hiring the best talents in the best ways or at least let students graduate with less debt while NOT forcing them to live in dorms like tetris pieces.", "Interview Questions": "I forgot it was so long ago but the question was really open ended and they didn't really require you to code.

I spoke briefly on the phone with the biostatistician who was reviewing resumes.  We went back and forth in email but I had a phone interview within a week (unusually fast for the University).  The phone interview consisted partly of a description of the research study whose data quality was being checked (QC was a big part of this job) and the reporting, analysis, etc. necessary.  The questions I answered had to do with why I was leaving my current position, what I had done with the relevant software (SAS), and so forth.  \r\n\r\nThe next step was a skills test - ten SAS programming problems.  Many were easy, some were at a fairly high skill level, but since I completed it on my own time, over a weekend, with full access to documentation, it was not a problem.  I also sent the biostatistician sample code and process documents.\r\n\r\nWithin a week I heard back and was invited for an in-person interview - but first, there was a lengthy email discussion about salary (since I was a current employee of the University, my salary was posted with other state employees, and he was able to determine I was earning much more than the position was budgeted for.  We were both still interested, so the in-person interview was scheduled.\r\n\r\nI met with two other data managers (the position was advertised as \"Data Manager\" but the University classification was \"Research Scientist/ Engineer III\"), the biostatistician, and the principal investigator for the research project.   It was an illuminating discussion; by the end it was clear (to me, at least) that the job would be better filled by someone who had a few years of SAS under her/ his belt rather than someone with database / project management experience (who would probably rock the boat).  \r\n\r\nI stayed at my current job.
