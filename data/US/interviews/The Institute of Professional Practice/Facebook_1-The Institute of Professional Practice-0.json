The interviewer and I scheduled a date and time to which we both agreed on. The day of the interview it was chaos and I did not know the precise Location of which to meet the interviewer and the receptionist was no help either. There were no customer skills at all. I arrived fifteen minutes prior the set date we made.  The interviewer came after 30 minutes to start the process to which she seemed disheveled. The interview took place in a computer room to which I sat on a low chair which I  did not mind. The interviewer concern was too much on my supervisory experience than the ones pertaining to the job I applied for. The interview last five minutes and next thing she is taking me to observe a child. I was not ready for an observation or to be observe on my job performance when I have no rapport with either child even with experience . All companies do things differently. Word s of advice from managemen: that is not how you adequately get people for the job. All companies especially from different states do things differently.
