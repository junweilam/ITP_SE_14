I did so, and in a couple of days received another email, this time from the hiring manager. She wanted to set up a date for an interview, which was quick and painless. I arrived at the interview 5 minutes early and the front desk person seemed like he was expecting me, then he asked that I wait. While I sat in the stuffy and very hot waiting area (think cheap doctors office), I could clearly hear the front desk guy looking for the people I was interviewing with, then after a short while he asked me to come with him. At some point as I followed, the guy realized that nobody was ready, or even around, so he asked me to go back to the waiting area again. Then I noticed there was a guy with a lot of gel in his hair sitting at the end of the hallway hollering as he closed his laptop to \"bring him back!\", yet I was clearly standing right there. That was a little odd I thought. I went to the conference room and ended up interviewing with 4 individuals; one team member, the gelled hair holler-er who ended up being some kind of \"hot shot\" supervisor who was way overdressed, and no doubt thought highly of himself, and two managers. They asked standard IT questions but seemed like they wanted to show off how awesome they thought their infrastructure was. Telling me little knowledge nuggets like \"we have over 400 technicians\" and \"we're using blah blah blah\", standard gloating type comments about how great they are. The hot shot supervisor aka gel guy had a bunch of meaningless specs on thousands of accounts and other uninteresting facts which seemed to impress his managers as he recited them (having no doubt just looked them up moments before we first met). It was humorous enough. The overall interview went well and I left with an overall positive feeling. Alas, I was never to hear from them again. That is the reason for my review here. I thought it to be pretty bizarre and border line unprofessional to leave no follow up with their potential candidates. No letter, no phone call, no email. Nothing... Nada... Zip! The thing that is irritating to me is that I was \"feeling them out\" just as much as they were trying to discover their \"perfect match\". I took time to devote to a potential career move with Promedica, and mind you I'm employed, so to me time really is money. I can safely say that I am no longer interested in Promedica. I will close with my overall thoughts: the office looked dated and booring, cubicles were jammed everywhere, almost no window light whatsoever, and super uncomfortable and stuffy. The employees that I saw as I walked by seemed to be silently screaming to me \"run away!\", \"run as fast as you can before you get sucked in!!!\", \"it's a trap!!\". Hopefully you get the point. Promedica seemed like it would be a wonderful opportunity. Unfortunately it seemed like a really bleak and unpleasant looking work environment. I felt bad for the \"team member\" who looked like he was forced to be there. Not only did he have no questions for me, but the managers forced him to ask me something. Pretty weird. My advice is to skip this one. As IT professionals we have opportunity to work in amazing fields and places that care about you.
