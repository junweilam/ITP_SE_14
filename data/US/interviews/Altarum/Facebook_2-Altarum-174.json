The process took about 9 weeks, across 5 interviews with HR, Hiring Manager, Cross-functional team leads, Senior Management, project management interview. I was told the process would take no more than 3 weeks. The recruiting team I found quite unprofessional and unable to stick to schedules, or even respect the time of candidates. After being called several times in one day by the same person, who was unwilling to schedule a call via email, I grew tired of the back-n-forth. Although I had spent the last 2 months going through this tiring interview process, I decided this wasn't the right environment for me.", "Interview Questions": "How do you handle competing priorities?

I had a phone interview with the recruiter. During the interview, I specifically asked if there were any assignments I would have to do, and she assured me there weren't. I then had my final panel interview and was told I would receive the decision by the end of the week. At the end of the week, the senior talent acquisition team leader asked if I would complete a writing exercise. I was hesitant and mentioned how this writing exercise was never mentioned, as I believe any company that wants you to do take-home assignments is not worth working for. I submit the writing exercise and then have to reach back out to the talent accusation team leader because she does not get back to me about an update. She then tells me how they are moving forward with another candidate, but another role has opened, and she asks if I would be interested. I tell her, yes, and then I never hear from her again. It was a blessing in disguise because I ended up receiving two job offers from different companies. The lack of professionalism, communication, and run around from this company tells me everything I needed to know.
