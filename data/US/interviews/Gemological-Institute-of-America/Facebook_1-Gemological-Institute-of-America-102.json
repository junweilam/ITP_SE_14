The technical director seemed less cold this time, but it felt forced. The interview went well despite some of the questions seeming a bit too loaded, or so I  thought. When I checked my application status online a few days later, they changed it to \"no longer under consideration\" when i emailed my HR contact, she stated that they went forward with a more qualified candidated. Considering the ridiculous turn around that they have,  I think it is fairly obvious that they are not picking the right candidates, and I stated many times that this was my career choice.
