I received immdiate outreach from an executive recruiter expressing interest to interview, and then total silence for weeks after I responded. When I sent them a follow-up as a courtesy (in case I'd been lost in the shuffle), the recruiter responded 10 days later with an apology and offering times for an interview. I had a perfectly fine introductory interview with the senior leader, where we talked generally about the position but not really in too much detail - presumably because much of the work would be done between peers in the system.  At the end, next steps were laid out and it was fully intimated that the recruiter would be contacting me to schedule the next formal round of interviews, where we would really dig in. \r\n\r\nThat recruiter never reached out one way or the other, even after a thank you email. The position is still posted months later.  I guess they want someone to just recruit themselves every step of the way?

Create a profile, save your info as you go. You can then use that completed form to apply for multiple Bon Secours positions and it is much faster. Once the app is submitted, you will be asked to complete the \"survey\" - it is a personality survey that determines if you would be a good fit within the company. It will ask similar questions over and over in different ways - to see if you change your answers each time, or if you are consistent. Be consistent! If you for some reason do not pass the personality survey, the HR dept will not even receive your app and you would be discarded as a candidate. So take your time with that survey!\r\n\r\nOnce you get through that exhausting process online, it's a waiting game for the call from HR. Hopefully, you will receive a call inviting you to interview with one of the managers. You will not really be given any info, other than what the position is and the name of the nurse manager, and of course the time and place for the interview.\r\n\r\nAt the interview, usually you'll meet with the nurse manager at the unit, spend some time interviewing in the office, and then spend some time taking a tour of the unit. Sometimes the nurse educator or assistant nurse manager would also sit in on the interview. Once it's over, you'll leave (hopefully with a business card!) and follow up by email to say thank you.\r\n\r\nIt totally depends on the unit and the urgency as to how long it will take to hear something.
