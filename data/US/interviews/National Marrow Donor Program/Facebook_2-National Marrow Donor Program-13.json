The questions are off general HR hiring form. I think they must ask all candidates the same questions regardless of field - they were sort of generic.

It's normal to interview with more than one person in the room - for example, an HR rep, the hiring manager, and a team lead or co-worker. The people interviewing will have been given a multi-page sheet of sample questions, which they read off in turn. Questions will typically be multi-part questions. An example: Tell us about a time when you did (blank). (Maybe, managed a project from start to finish; or maybe, had a disagreement with a colleague.) The main question will be followed by more specifics: What was the situation? Who did you talk to? What was the end result? These types of interview questions rely on the principle that past behavior on the job is is the best predictor of future behavior. Try to be specific in your answers. Even if it's something that happens all the time, you'll be asked to pick one illustrative example to talk about. Don't get hung up on answering all the multiple parts, in order. The questions are not meant to be a memory test - they are meant to get you talking about yourself and your approach to your work. Be honest in your answers. If you, for example, tend to avoid conflict or smooth over awkward situations, that's real for you. If, however, you normally face a conflict head-on, then let them know that. Maybe they're looking for a \"smoother,\" or maybe they're looking for \"honesty,\" but either way, if you're not yourself, then both you and the NMDP will be unhappy with the hire decision.", "Interview Questions": "Have you had to convince your team to work on a project they weren't thrilled about?
