In approximately one week after that, I was invited to the on-site interview.   I mentioned that I have to travel from Silicon Valley to attend the on-site interview and was verbally assured that all travel expenses should be taken care of because this is a Director-level position.   When I have already made all the travel arrangements,  I found out that I am meeting with just a single person.  I specifically reminded the HR to arrange several interviews to make sure I meet everyone in a single on-site interview visit.  Nevertheless, when I came to the Department of Urology, I still was scheduled to meet just a single interviewer.    Moreover, the interviewer was late and spent just 30 minutes for the interview.   He said that everything looks great and they will invite me for a second on-site interview soon.  After the interview, the admin assistant said she will send me the travel expense reimbursement forms but I never received them.   Then I tried to contact HR and they said that this position is a \"Director-level\" only in the advertisement but in reality, this is a low-level analyst position which is not eligible for travel reimbursement.  What a lie!  Basically, I wasted the entire day and my own money just to meet with one interviewer for 30 minutes!
