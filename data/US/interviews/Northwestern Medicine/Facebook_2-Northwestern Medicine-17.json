The job posting was vague (did not specify what department the role was for) and the talent coordinator did not seem to have a clear understanding of the role and what the department was looking for. Speaking to the talent coordinator, he mentioned to me that \"NMH is a political org so we will try to move as fast as we can but keep that in mind\". My first interview was a standard 30 minute behavioral interview with the hiring manager. Next, I was moved to a 45 minute technical interview with a program manager. Then I did not hear from NMH for 2 weeks untiled I was asked to come onsite for a 2.5 hour in person interview. They gave me the full agenda 12 hours before my interview where I was scheduled to speak with the hiring manager again, a 3 person stakeholder interview, then an interview with their analytics manager, and then a panel interview with 5 clinicians managers (this role was non-clinical). All of the onsite interviews were behavioral based and similar questions were being asked in each round. I later got feedback that I did not get the role because I did not seem \"overly excited\" for the position and that the interviewers felt I should have not asked about career progression within this specific role and NMH as an overall organization. I found the process to be slow and there was scope crept regarding the role that I did not find out until I was at my onsite interview.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work at Northwestern Memorial?

The hiring manager reached out to me via Indeed and within days I had a virtual interview with her. I even scheduled a phone interview with the HR representative the day after Thanksgiving. The next step was to interview in person. I arrived well dressed and ahead of schedule. I was very excited to meet everyone and had a great experience, or so I thought. Thinking back, I noticed that the surgeon who I was to potentially work under, was asking personal questions from the very second I sat down. He questioned if I had children and what type of education they were receiving. He automatically assumed they were enrolled in a public school and he went as far as to ask if the e-learning they experienced the past year had harmed them in any way. Which was odd but I thought he was just being curious. I thought it was going well when he abruptly ended the interview. Being that he is a highly regarded and very busy surgeon, I didn\u2019t quite feel it was because he just simply made up his mind right then and there that I wasn\u2019t a good fit. After, I continued to interview with the rest of the staff. I met  5 people in total and everyone seemed great! I felt pretty good leaving that morning. I followed up with an email when I had not heard back for almost 2 weeks, the hiring manager simply responded stating that there was another doctor they\u2019d like me to meet. Making this the 4th interaction with one or more staff members. The interview was at 7:30am. This was my 2nd time driving up to the hospital and paying for parking. There was definitely effort on my end! When I arrived the doctor seemed frazzled. I thought maybe he had a busy schedule. He wasn\u2019t really engaged as it seemed his mind was somewhere else. He\u2019d start to speak on a subject and then forget where he was going with the conversation. At one point, someone walked in and he didn\u2019t know who it was. I asked if it was his patient but he just seemed confused. The point is that he was not into the interview. I also ended up meeting his nurse that morning. My experience there was better but I left knowing that I wasn\u2019t going to get a call back. Either way, a couple weeks later, I sent yet another follow up email thanking the hiring manager, congratulating them on finding the right candidate if it applied and asking for some feedback. At this point, I was 100% positive the position was not going to be awarded to me. Normally, this wouldn\u2019t be a problem. It\u2019s a part of the job hunting/interview process. I am not at all disappointed that I wasn\u2019t chosen if I wasn\u2019t a good fit but more so that I felt as though my race played a  role in their decision making. The entire office aside from 2 of their surgeons are Caucasian. I hate to think this way in this day and age and especially because the team seemed to mostly be millennials who are usually very aware and open minded. But I just cannot shake that feeling off! After she responded that a decision wasn\u2019t made yet, I left it alone and thought that was her way of dodging my question of asking for a helpful critique. I received an email today after almost 2 months from the hiring manager. In the email she is telling me yes, yup! I\u2019ll finally let you in on it, the position has definitely been filled BUT we\u2019d like to offer you an opportunity to work the front desk. An entry level type of job. I have a degree and I have over a decade of customer service and management experience. That was in my opinion, rude. Yet, I still responded gracefully and with no ill words. I am a well qualified person who has years of experience but was offered an entry level role after so much effort and interest was placed. Hiring managers, please be aware that we are people too and that we also deserve to be acknowledged timely and please, please do NOT take it upon yourself to personally demote people!
