Then i went on a 30 minute tour with one of their senior technicians who was very helpful and topped the experience as a delightful one . I then returned to a group of (well not a group but was supposed to be) two female pharmacists who took notes and asked me several challenging but fun questions. I connected very easily with them and they actually over-used their interview time . Overall, it was a delightful experience and I am still in shock on how I didn't get the position(even though I am a Senior Certified Pharm tech) but it was a great learning experience .
