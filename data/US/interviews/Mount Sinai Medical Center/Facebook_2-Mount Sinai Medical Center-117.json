It's was the orientation that didn't go well. First of all, the people doing the orientations for new employees were RUDE. I came in with new sneaks pants and a dress shirt. 2 hours later they tell me I don't meet the dressed code Bc I had sneakers. They told me to leave and go to human resource. HOWEVER, I saw new nurses dressed in scrubs, flip flops, Jeans etc. A few weeks later I had to do another orientation.  When I was hired I didn't have an updated ID so from my understanding, she told me to bring it after I finish the second schedule orientation.  This time I came dressed, showed up in pants, dress shirt the works. At 10 am, the same rude lady who pulled me out the last time, did it again and rudely said goto human resource and don't return!!!!!  I'll never forget that!!  I went back and she told me I wasn't hired anymore Bc I didn't bring my ID BEFORE ORIENTATION? Which was weird Bc I thought she told me to bring it the day of orientation? I had it that day and showed her. She looked at me and said sorry they decided to not hire me.  I explained to her she never told me there was a dressed code, I was drressed nicely both times and at both orientations I attended, there were nurses in scrubs , jeans, flip flops etc. Why are nurses getting special treatment? Not too mention I saw new nurses come to the orientation hours late and they were not asked to leave!!! I would never reapply again from that experience. Besides they are paying 1990 wages. Not worth my trouble if I can't be treated with the same respect as nurses.  I learned that from just being humiliated at ORIENTATION. SAD", "Interview Questions": "Do you work well with nurses?"}]]
