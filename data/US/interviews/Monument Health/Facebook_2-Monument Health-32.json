The last interview, which felt unapologetically like a, \"lets throw 'er a bone\" type of group interview came and went with little to no response from the HR representative. It took a variety of emails for them to even acknowledge that the last of 4 fairly intelligent interviews even took place. Its clear that the organization is currently undergoing a great amount of change and that can always cause a certain amount of chaos. However, it looks bad from an outsiders perspective if you string along a candidate due to internal turmoil, lack of organization, or rather for any reason.
