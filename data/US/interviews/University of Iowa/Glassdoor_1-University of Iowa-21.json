This could involve additional filtering criteria, such as aptitude tests, assessments, or preliminary telephonic or video interviews. Schedule Interview: Once the candidates are selected, the recruitment team schedules formal interviews. These interviews could be conducted in-person, via video call, or even as a panel interview, depending on the organization's process.
