I did one video interview with them-- I can say abundantly that the two interviewers lacked professionalism. eg. they continued to mispronounce my current institution's name despite my telling them specifically how it's pronounced. For those who don't know, Purdue Global was once a private ed company (that Purdue now owns). A lot of the employees that Global has came from private sector jobs and aren't used to jobs in education. This interview mad that clear.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview was completed, I never heard back from them or their HR rep. Quite frankly, I'm glad.

I submit my responses, which was on a Wednesday, and the next day (Thursday) I get an email around 9:45pm from HR asking if I was available to interview the following day (Friday) at 9am. I was unavailable during that time (I also didn't like be given less than 24 hours notice) so I gave the HR rep my availability and asked if any of the other days/times would work. I didn't hear back from her so I followed up that following Monday and we got an interview scheduled for that Thursday. It was a virtual interview and I met with 3 people. The interview was different from others I've been on. 1 person would ask all their questions (maybe 5 questions), and then after they asked their questions would move on to the next person. The interviewers who weren't asking questions would turn their camera off, as if they weren't \"in the room\". Honestly, it didn't seem personable and kind of rude. At one point one of the interviewers lost connection and left the interview while I was answering a question (that she asked), and that really threw me off. The other two interviewers sat their silently with their cameras off, since it wasn't their set of questions, and we waited for the other interviewer to get back online . At the end of the interview when asked, \"Do you have any questions for us,\" 2/3 of the interviewers were nice (though one kept their camera off) and answered my questions. The other interviewer seemed like she had already made up her mind that I wasn't right for the position and was very short in her responses or just didn't answer at all. She was also the one who lost the connection, so maybe she was upset about that; but overall she came off pretty rude. I was told I'd hear back from HR about next steps, but it's been over a month since I interviewed and I haven't heard back. I'm assuming I didn't get the job, but that's fine because I've since accepted a much better job.", "Interview Questions": "Talk about a project where you used a project management cycle."}, {"date": "18 Jul 2021", "title": "Student Services Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Purdue Global", "Interview Descriptions": "Pretty straight forward.2-3 rounds of interview sessions.
