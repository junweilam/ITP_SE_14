Applications for an August start date opened in October of the proceeding year. It took about a month after the application deadline (November 15) to hear from the search committee chair for a phone interview (December 17). The phone interview was with the entire search committee. Questions at this stage were centered on ability to teach and mentor students. Within a week of the phone interview (December 21), I was notified that I received a campus visit. The campus interview was scheduled for January 29 & 30. I did not receive the itinerary for the visit until a week before the interview. The campus interview lasted a day and a half. It included: breakfast with the search committee, tour of facilities, search committee interview, job talk presentation, teaching demo, meeting with department students, dinner with the chairs, interview with the dean, and interview with the department chair. There was also some down time for an unguided tour of the campus. They provided guidelines for the teaching demo, but I was able to select the topic. I was offered the position a month after my campus interview (February 25). The department chair scheduled a call with me and verbally offered the position and the starting salary. They asked for my start-up request and other negotiation terms. Salary was non-negotiable. I was able to negotiate $30,000 for start up funds (that must be spent within the first two years) and service credit toward tenure. Teaching load was non-negotiable as all new hires have half a teaching load in the first two years. Moving expenses were also non-negotiable since I lived within 50 miles of the campus. My spouse was not looking for a job, so I did not request a partner hire. The chair collected my request and acted as the middle-man for negotiations with the dean. After the offer was approved, the University needed official copies of graduate transcripts before sending out the offer letter for a signature. This last part in the hiring process took several months. The department chair was very responsive throughout the entire process. \n\n**WARNING** CPP is a beautiful, huge, and hilly campus.

Received three separate calls for different ASC positions. All three positions were for different departments of the University. In each of all the interviews, the Dean of the Department sat in for the interview which does not support them to begin with. Coming from a major So-Cal University I don't understand where the Cal POly Deans find the time to sit in on an insignificant staff position. Cal Poly Pomona seems to be very nepotistic in hiring other Cal Poly/ CSU grads for staff positions while they fill their Faculty/ Administration with UC and Ivy grads. Makes sense... Save money on the staff while filling the pockets of Faculty... \r\n\r\nBut I digress... The process takes forever! At least 3-4 weeks before getting the phone interview, another 3-4 weeks for the actual interview and 8 weeks for the offer (for 1/3 positions). I assume they offered the position to someone else and it did not work out. The questions for staff positions are simple as long as you use the STAR method. The interviews were a pleasure and had a great balance between being personal and professional.\r\n\r\nThe negative for Cal Poly Pomona is how long the process takes and how unprofessional the staff is with regards to follow-up. I mean 16 weeks for basically an assistant position. I have heard from 1/3  positions and I believe I will not hear back from the other 2. When you go through 4-5 hour multi-day interviews and become a finalist, you hope that they would at least take the time to email you to let you know what the result was. Don't waste your time following up to see where the process is, they will respond with absolute silence. \r\n\r\nBasically got offered another similar position in another So-Cal University paid 1.5x more than what they would have offered. Try your luck somewhere else. I'm just sad, cause I really wanted to get a feel for Cal Poly as I was looking into a masters program they offer.
