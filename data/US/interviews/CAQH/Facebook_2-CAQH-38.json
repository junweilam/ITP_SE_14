I had a first call and then was told they want to schedule more calls, then did not hear back for about a month about when they actually wanted to schedule them. Eventually I was asked about my availability for the following week, which I sent. I last minute heard back that they had scheduled 5.5 hours of interviews and a case study, mostly all on one day. I am working a full time job and told the recruiters I could not accommodate\u00a0all of this time on one day given my other job. I was given a lot of pushback and they attempted to make it seem like it's my fault for giving my availability on those days.\nIn addition, they required a case study that required a good deal of time to prep for, including developing a presentation and then running a mock call with several CAQH team members, and then writing a mock follow up email for after the call. The process of scheduling this was also frustrating and I was sent the wrong link to the meeting, which added extra stress right before the call.\nAfter all of this pressure to get the calls done as quickly as possible during one week, and a lot of effort on my end to make this work during a busy work week, I then heard nothing from them for over a month. Finally, I heard I did not get the job and that they didn't move forward with any of the candidates and would keep looking.\nWhile I enjoyed some of the conversations I had with team members, I would never consider interviewing with CAQH or with these recruiters again. I did not feel like they respected my time, were organized or that they knew what they were looking for.

They then got back to me a week after that only to say they were closing the position and would re-evaluate in 90 days. So, basically they wasted a month and a half of process time plus all the work that went into it just to abandon the process entirely.
