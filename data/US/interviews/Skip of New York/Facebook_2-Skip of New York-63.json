They begrudgingly complied- but mixed up the day and time because they do not use email or electronic calendars (the first of the red flags).  I eventually had phone interview with executive director and program director, it went extremely well and I was very excited about the role. When I met with them in person, the interview was very unstructured. They had very few legitimate questions to ask and I felt like they did 95% of the talking. Afterwards, they had me complete an intake and do a computer task. The task was so basic and I quickly realized that I was beyond qualified for this position.  During the interview, the role and salary they spoke about offering me was VERY different from the role and salary they actually offered me. The biggest turnoff from the whole experience was the negative way in which the executive director spoke about her employees.
