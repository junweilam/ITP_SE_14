I had a phone interview, which I would say was more extensive than most I've had, and then a day of in-person interviews at the office in which I'd be working. Overall, it was a good experience--interviewers were friendly and gracious, they made sure to show me around the facilities/campus, and I got to meet my potential coworkers, all of which helped me assess my level of interest in the position. They were also helpful and communicative when I was making travel plans (I was traveling in from another state).\r\n\r\nI've never received a rejection from either the hiring manager or the human resources office. Considering the time I spent traveling to the interview and back, this is really disrespectful and has certainly tanked my impression of the organization.
