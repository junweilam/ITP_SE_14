The team was communicative regarding next steps throughout the process and available to answer questions. The CEO was very open, honestly sharing where they are as an organization, which was very helpful in my own discernment as to whether or not it was a good fit. He took the time to know me as an applicant and generously shared feedback.

It went well and I did another video interview. I advanced to the next round and flew out to Boston for the final interview. It was really nice that they paid for the travel, because most nonprofits expect you to pay out of pocket. The questions were really straight-forward, and everyone was very friendly and respectful of my time, which I appreciated. I didn't get an offer, but they were nice enough to connect with me on LinkedIn and offer to help me with possible job connections at other local nonprofits.", "Interview Questions": "How do you handle conflict?"}, {"date": "6 Oct 2016", "title": "Intern Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Peace First in Jun 2014", "Interview Descriptions": "I interviewed over the phone and answered basic questions about my organizational habits, my past work experience, and what I thought I could bring to the position.

A week and a half later,  I received a response with a list of five questions that had to be answered before they would decide who to interview. I spent the weekend composing thoughtful answers to each question and then submitted my answers. The next day, the Operations Coordinator emailed back and arranged for a phone interview. The phone interview consisted of standard interview questions such as why you are interested in the position and describe your background. \r\n\r\nSeveral questions were of the \"what would you do in this situation\" variety but hard to answer without any sense of the organization's culture, modus operandi and time to reflect. The Operations Coordinator did not come across as someone with much experience conducting interviews because she was reading from a script and many of the questions she asked were already answered in writing. I was not particularly impressed and struggled to contain my disappointment that she did not bother to read what I wrote. To make matters worse, what they were looking for was a Scheduler for the President who would cater to his every need at whatever time he wanted something. When I asked if there was any other responsibilities it became clear that despite the title, the scope of the position was pretty limited.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview concluded, she indicated that they would be in touch by the end of the week with those that they wanted to invite to meet with the President. I never heard back and wasn't expecting to based on the phone screen. Two weeks later I received the standard email sent to candidates that were unsuccessful which states that your resume will be kept on file.\r\n\r\nThese are the questions that they ask you to respond to in writing:\r\n\r\n1.\tWhy do you want this job? How do you see the role of Special Assistant fitting into your larger professional goals? (Please limit your response to one paragraph.)\r\n\r\n2.\tUsing the job description as a reference, what makes you an exceptional candidate for this position?  Which parts will draw on your strengths?  Which areas will be more of a challenge? (Please limit your response to two paragraphs.)\r\n\r\n3.\tEric\u2019s role requires him to spend a decent amount of time out of the office. In order to have success in this position, you will have to be able to prioritize and work independently. Could you describe a project you had to complete with a limited amount of supervision? (Please limit your response to two paragraphs.)\r\n\r\n4.\tHow would you describe your ideal work environment? How would you describe your ideal supervisor? (Please limit your response to two paragraphs.)\r\n\r\n5.\tWhat are your salary requirements? Is there anything else we should know about what is important to your success?

From there, they selected candidates to be interviewed by the president by phone. Lastly, those of us who made the grade were invited in to meet the president and COO, for an in-person interview.
