Then was invited for an on-site interview. I am not local and had to travel 700 miles for interview. The on-site interview consisted of a 1-1 interview for an hour, then a group/panel interview. Everyone was very kind and seemed like a great place to work for. Interview wen't extremely well, I was told I'd hear back within a couple of days and left with a very confident feeling. A couple days went by, no answer. Couple weeks went by, no answer. I followed up with HR a couple times and finally TWO MONTHS later I found out I did not get the job. Found out because the HR lady (who is extremely kind and helpful) went out of her way to see the interviewer in person and ask if they were going to hire me or not. \r\nI'm not upset that I did not get the job (bummed, yes a little) but I am mad that I traveled so far and spent a LOT of money to be there for this interview, to then be ignored and lied to in the end.

I was in shock and started to just leave at that point but decided to see where this was going.  The recruiter called me back in and said she could not reach the manager and just go ahead and go over to meet her.  I was given about 10 minutes to make a trip that normally took 20 and when I left the building I really contemplated not going to meet the manager.
