I then met with the two hiring managers for the role via Zoom. This process has been, by far, the most drawn-out, agitating, and frustrating experience I have had as a candidate in a while. After my first Zoom interview with the hiring managers for the role, I was told they would get back to me within two weeks. OK- I can handle that. Two weeks later, I got an email from the hiring manager telling me that the first round of interviews were still being scheduled and that they were delayed. But they would reach back out to me as soon as possible with the next steps in the process. Well, that time has come and gone, and I haven't been updated. My frustration with Harvard's process is two-fold: Recruiters are supposed to ensure that candidates are kept warm in the pipeline so they don't lose talent. Recruiters are also supposed to act as a middle person between a candidate and a hiring manager to ensure that the process is moving smoothly and without delays. I only got to interact with my recruiter ONCE. And then it was like they dropped off the face of the planet. I've had this phenomenon happen numerous times at this institution. It makes me wonder what the recruiters do at Harvard because it isn't recruiting. My second frustration is with higher education's recruiting process as a whole. I don't know if Harvard is entirely relying on their namesake, which is why they have no real sense of urgency in their hiring process, or if the bureaucracy within this school is just THAT ridiculous, but don't be in a hurry to find a job.

Within a few weeks, they flew me out for an on-site interview. I had to pay out of pocket to book my hotel and flight, but was later reimbursed. The onsite consisted of meeting with the PI I'd work for, a lab/facilities tour, a one hour presentation by me to the group, then several one-on-one meetings with the director of the center and various other people. Lunch was in a conference room where other postdocs gave me presentations of their research and I asked them questions. There wasn't really any one-on-one time with other postdocs, as the PI was in the lunch room with us. I wish I would have had some one-on-one time with the other postdocs so I could have asked questions about the PI's management style.\r\n\r\nDuring the portion of the interview with the director, I was offered the position on the spot. I verbally accepted. The official letter came later. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the hardest part of the process has been the onboarding. It's a dual appointment with BWH, and BWH has been extremely rude and unhelpful throughout the process. I feel as if I didn't press issues on my end (like setting up the occupational health screening, etc) then my start date would have been continually pushed back (it was already delayed by 1 week). The go-to person at BWH has been a nightmare to work with and has said things like \"you are taking up too much of my time,\" \"I will apologize on your behalf to HR for contacting them,\" \"now you have wasted my time,\" etc., when I have e-mailed questions and waited for more than 5 days for a response. The whole onboarding process literally almost made me want to throw my hands up and look for a position elsewhere. It was the most unwelcoming thing I have ever experienced as a new hire!! I can only hope my interaction with this person ends after this stage and it's smooth sailing from here out. \r\n\r\nThe interview process was actually amazing. If you come prepared and knowledgeable about the lab you're joining, then there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I was not at all expecting to be offered the position on the spot.

Last year I figured I\u2019d try to get my foot in the door by temping, so I accepted a three month long assignment that paid $14/hr, hoping it would be an investment...\r\n\r\nAfter three months, the person I was covering for came back.  But I was thrilled  when the department called me back a month later,  asking me to fill in again. It turned out the original person left for good, so there was now an open position available! \r\n\r\nI truly thought this was my lucky break, since they requested me back for the same role that was now open. But whenever I asked about the timeframe to actually be hired, they would just say they\u2019re not sure what the new role will look like and that I should basically treat every day like an audition for the job. This went on for three months (so by now I was there for a total of six months and getting more and more stressed).\r\n\r\n After they maxed out the time they could keep me as a temp, they decided to make me a Term employee for three months, hyping it up to seem like a huge success. But whenever I asked my supervisor for projects that would allow me to leave a foot print and prove myself, she would just tell me she appreciates my proactiveness, but unfortunately \u201cit\u2019s not appropriate because you\u2019re a Term employee\u201d.  So, I made sure to keep a spreadsheet of everything I did, and tried to build solid relationships with my co-workers. My supervisor and the Director even told me on numerous occasions that all of the reviews they\u2019d gotten about me were  been very positive. \r\n\r\nHowever, towards the end of my term end date,  one of the managers gave me a very generic interview and barely glanced at the spreadsheet. And when I asked the department director a few days later if there are any updates, he told me I wasn\u2019t even chosen as a finalist for the position. \r\n\r\nI wish I knew what was going through their minds as they put me through this experience, and why they wanted to keep me around as long as they did if they weren\u2019t intending to hire me permanently.", "Interview Questions": "How do you measure success?"}, {"date": "18 Dec 2019", "title": "Postdoctoral Research Fellow Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0I interviewed at Harvard University (Boston, MA) in Feb 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "I was introduced to the principal investigator and we discussed about the projects available.

I applied online and was called for a phone screening just a week later, which lasted about 30 minutes and asked basic questions like my previous experience, ability to do the job, why I want to be involved with the project, etc.  Lots of description of the position, which I appreciated.  The email said that the call would last about 15 minutes but it was more like 30, which I saw as a good thing.  They wanted to know a lot of details about my current position and work.  The phone screening was ended with the scheduling of a Skype meeting with other people in the department.  This is where the process got frustrating.\r\n\r\nI was on Skype waiting for the interviewer to connect and they were running late.  They then sent me an email saying that they had \"written down the wrong time\" for the interview and asked if I could do it an hour later, which I did.  After waiting over an hour to speak, this interview was exactly the same as the phone screening.  Same questions, same answers, but to one other person, in addition to the person I spoke with on the phone.  Why wouldn't they share the information  from my phone screening and then ask me different, more in depth questions on Skype?  Aside from all that, it went as well as it could, and about 3 days later I was offered a more formal Skype interview with the professor that I would potentially be working alongside.  I was told that this would be the final interview for the position, so I felt good about that.\r\n\r\nFor the final interview, there were even more problems.  They were on time this time, but they had very serious technical difficulties connecting to Skype and using their camera and microphone.  I was patient and even helped them out with getting it connected properly.  This all took about 30 minutes.  Once we finally got connected, the professor said that he had to go to another meeting that was very important and was sorry that we couldn't talk.  The assistant who had done the first few interviews with me asked me just a few questions, but sort of rushed me because I guess the room was booked up for another group to use and she had to get out.  Basically, I sat there for 30 minutes while they tried to get connected and then did not get to have a real interview with real questions.  I wasn't even given time to give real answers.  \r\n\r\nI emailed saying that I understood the technical difficulties but would like to have another chance, if possible.  No answer.  I emailed two weeks later asking the same thing, and this time was an immediate answer:  We picked someone else.\r\n\r\nI have interviewed for these positions at several top universities and I am stricken at how unprofessional almost every person at Harvard was throughout this whole process.  It made it very frustrating.  I feel that I should have been told that there was a time restriction on my final interview and I feel that I should have been given another chance.  None of it was my fault.  I got pushed out of an interview that I was very excited and very prepared for.  I feel that I gave a lot of good information and good answers in the initial phone screening, but wasn't even given a chance to do that in the later interviews, when it mattered a lot more.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, I feel that I did as well as I could have and the interview questions were relatively easy.  The entire process took about 3-4 weeks, which is very fast.  I think that this was a one-time (very) bad experience and I will continue to apply for positions here, obviously.  The lesson I took from this is that from now on, I am going to avoid Skype meetings if it is possible.  If I had made the trip for an in-person interview, I might have this job right now.

As soon as the call began, I could tell not only that this was a very broad, boiler plate phone screen (the type you would have when starting work with a staffing agency) but also that the description of the job was much more glorified that the actual position.  It seems that the only thing that the coordinators do at Harvard is coordinate administrative support.  It was clear the interviewer hadn't read my resume-at all-since she asked me why I wanted to move into this specific field and I replied that I had been working in that field for a decade so it wasn't exactly a move for me. This raised yet another red flag for me, if she knew this was an entry level admin support role, I'm not sure why they wasted their time and mine knowing I had a decade of experience. I had the Harvard job grades and salary estimations chart in front of me that I had printed off the website.  When she asked my salary requirements, confident with my qualifications and skills (and also knowing what I deserve to make), I said I number and she audibly scoffed.  She said they would only be prepared to offer me $25,000 less than the number that I mentioned.  I said that was surprising given the pay scales that were listed on their site, in fact, the number she mentioned was even lower than the minimum for an entry level position and she said there was no room for negotiations.   I had read other reviews that mentioned negotiating was discouraged but I didn't think it would happen at the very first stage.  It was also frustrating to have a clearly junior recruiter ask repetitive questions, giving the impression that she hadn't read my resume and wasn't even listening to my responses (asking questions I already provided answers to, I must have said \"As I mentioned earlier\" no less than 8 times in a 37 minute call).", "Interview Questions": "No unexpected questions...not even a resume review.

Be prepared to interact and communicate with a minimum of 10+ people per every position you interview for at Harvard. It is one thing to have a candidate professionally meet other members of the team they would be working with, but it is another to have candidates sit down with nearly every team member, when the majority of team members do not have enough substantial experience conducting interviews.\r\nIt seems contradictory that Harvard is so stern about its HR/screening interview process, yet when it comes time to interview rounds, the University has no qualms about throwing candidates in to interview sessions with quasi-important team members that ask ridiculous questions because they are not yet well-seasoned enough to know how to conduct an interview in a light that best represents the University.\r\nThere seems to be a huge lapse in the interview process at Harvard. The first phone interview was conducted with an HR rep over the phone, the initial phone screening (this applies to any job) is really just about verifying if the candidate sounds like an educated, respectable person. At Harvard, the issue arrives during the in-person interviews. The first meeting is segregated to meet 1 on 1 with several different people. After the first session, the next time Harvard has you in it will be to meet with other members of the team- be prepared for a variety of meetings during the second round as you may meet 1 on 1 and then 2 on 1, etc. The issue in this specific department is that all of the members are not qualified to conduct interviews. The style of every interview with this (rather small) team was inconsistent and it gave me a red flag- it felt like the team has low energy and that there is no cohesive personae to this team.  I felt a huge shift in personality, interests, and experience from person to person. The sense of humor was lacking in some and present with others. Some of the interviewers for this position were gracious, others were distant, some followed up in emails, some ignored them, and some even acted like I was about to get hired, then shifty answers with HR followed next, and some shifty moves by HR/the hiring manager quickly let me know that the position was going to be given to the other candidate. \r\nTotal bag of mixed messages, ups and downs, and dragging along for well over a month. For about two solid weeks I was lead to believe that I was going to be offered the position and then all of a sudden I got a very rude vibe from the people that I was been dealing with. It is HR on Hiring Managers on Chaos. Also, last note- their \"reference\" background check is literally the most impersonal process in existence. They ask for reference information and they send your references an email from a \"do not reply\" address. In the body of the email, the third party (the company that conducts the electronic reference checks) drafts the emails for you and sends it out to five professional references that you provide Harvard with. Case in point, Harvard- if you are going to do reference checks, have the decency to make HR pick up the phone. Seriously, get rid of this third party reference check computer system. I value the relationships that I have with my references and did not appreciate the HR banging out automated emails asking all of my references to conduct a survey. Sneaky language in the email too! Harvard, pick up the phone and call references. This is so inefficient, impersonal, fake, worthless, useless. What does this third party system remotely provide you with? I find it implausible to see how you gather useful, candid, meaningful information about candidates by dealing with references this way. It seems like a lazy HR move. Make your HR employees have actual conversations, this is not remotely professional!", "Interview Questions": "I literally was asked by a staff member \"What is your favorite color?\" as well as \"What can you tell us about yourself that we can't tell by looking at you?\" My answer to the first question about my favorite color was \"White\" because when sunlight passes through a spectrum the white light represents all colors, therefore by having white as my favorite color, it actually makes all colors my favorite color. I got a blank stare and then was asked by the two (very young) interviewer some other questions that were completely irrelevant. It was clear they were just asking the first things that came to mind. It felt like they were trying to make me feel like an idiot. These two interviewers seemed lethargic, burnt out, dry, and snobby, it was draining to be in the room with them.
