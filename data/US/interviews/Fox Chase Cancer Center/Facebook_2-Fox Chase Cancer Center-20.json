All of them went through the same recruiter. What a disaster that was. I got one offer, one rejection, and the other I withdrew from after accepting the other offer. The HR staff proactively advised AGAINST hiring me. I had accepted a job offer directly from the hiring manager. He was \"very excited\" that I accepted the offer. Three hours later I find out, through HR, that the job offer was rescinded. What a pos. There is no doubt HR helped sway him to not hiring me. But I'm glad I don't work at this awful company. Their salaries are awful anyway. They are trying to scam you. The only purpose of the HR bureaucracy is to pay sci techs less money. This way Temple saves a few bucks on payroll taxes. This was the worst interview experience I ever had. HR persuaded a hiring manager NOT to hire me (despite already accepting the offer). I even withdrew from one of my other interviews at Fox Chase after accepting the offer. The HR rep even said that they didn't \"screw me\" out of the position I withdrew from since I \"wasn't a top candidate anyway\". Yeah, that's why they brought me in for an interview after a 40 minute phone screen, because I wasn't a top candidate. And yet the HR rep had the nerve to yell at me for directly contacting the hiring manager (oh what a crime!). This company is awful, HR hates you, and the hiring managers will lie to your face. Don't apply to Fox Chase, they are going to underpay you anyway. Don't let them scam you. HR is the worst.", "Interview Questions": "Most question were related to science experience.
