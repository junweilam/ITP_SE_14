There were three rounds: \r\n1. An initial phone interview\r\n2. Zoom interview\r\n3. In-person interview that consisted of a) case studies and questions with two individuals and b) a separate peer interview.\r\n\r\nBefore I get into the interview questions, I want to discuss how shady the entire process was. Contact with professionals at Upstream was extremely spaced out, with no receipt of email confirmation or really any correspondence after following up. I did not even know the salary or location of the position until 3.5 months after being involved in their process. \r\n\r\nThe recruiter told me up front that this position would not be starting for 5 months, but could make exceptions if someone needed to be employed sooner. I let them know that this was the case for me, but the process did not move any quicker. I came to find out from LinkedIn that someone with less experience had been hired into this role much sooner than the originally planned start date (they had four openings for the same position).\r\n\r\nI was made aware that I would be prepped by a recruiter for my in-person interview, which never happened. \r\n\r\nThe Zoom interview was great - no complaints there. This was a typical \u201ctell me about your experience\u201d interview, very straightforward. \r\n\r\nThe in-person interview was a disaster. It started off with two case studies that were meant to show what someone in this position would typically experience on the job. Then there was a third case study that was a literal printout of a PowerPoint slide, and without any writing utensils, I was asked to verbally explain how I would fix that slide. I found this absolutely ridiculous - if it were sent in an email and I had some time to show creativity, I would have been better than mumbling over my thought process in front of them. I was embarrassed, and I think this is a surefire way to make candidates look inferior (despite knowing how to optimally edit a PowerPoint after many years of formal education and work experience). The PowerPoint was out of line for an interview and there was no way anyone could have prepared for that. \r\n\r\nThen, the second individual who wasn\u2019t in the original Zoom interview asked some questions, all of which were either repeated standard questions from the Zoom interview, or extremely negative and borderline condescending personality questions.\r\n\r\nThe peer interview seemed like filler, considering that person was not even in the role I was interviewing for. They mostly asked about background. \r\n\r\nOverall, it felt like Upstream was confused on what the position even is and what they were looking for. The questions felt as if they were designed to deliberately cut down a strong applicant with years of experience and education in the field, especially someone so excited and eager about their mission. The process was disorganized from start to finish, and I think they could benefit from a hiring structure that is much more clear and concise. Rather than feeling disappointed that I didn\u2019t get the job, I am appalled and hurt after getting so excited about this interview and finding out that it would only be negative, demeaning, and a display of the exact place I would never want to work.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us about a time when you had a conflict with someone you worked with"}, {"date": "10 Dec 2018", "title": "State Director of Quality Improvement Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Upstream USA (Seattle, WA) in Oct 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "Initial screening interviews with recruiter, then with the Director of QI.
