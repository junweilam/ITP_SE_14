A position for which I am more than qualified perhaps overqualified. There were two people a director and an employee. The interview was very rigid and structured, not conversational at all. It seemed they were only interested in getting to know the professional and not the person. It felt rehearsed as they both took turns asking questions based on a script they read. I felt it was impersonal. Having worked in HR myself, I find that conversational interviews work best in recruiting talent. Both recruiters spent most of the time looking into their computer monitors and not making eye contact with me, which is crucial in person and even more so in a virtual interview.\nAt one point and  I was talking and made a grammatical mistake (English is my second language) and I was quick to self-correct and at that moment the director quickly turned her face to see me. At that point, I thought it was unlikely I would get the job, and I was right, so much for inclusion and diversity.  It is unfortunate, TAMU still has staff with this attitude and worse when it is now a Hispanic Serving Institution. These behaviors give TAMU the bad reputation it has struggled so hard to change.
