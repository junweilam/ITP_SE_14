I ended the day with an HR interview. \r\n\r\nThere were tons of behavioral based questions, technical questions by the staff, and the Administrator put me through a bunch of real-life scenarios. He was really straight-forward, and blunt which was a different style than the rest of the interviews. Be prepared to explain in detail why you want to work there and he'll try to put you on the defensive. If you say your challenge is keeping up your staff's morale, he's likely to ask why he should  hire you if you haven't figured out how to keep up morale? It was interesting, challenging and fun in a weird way.", "Interview Questions": "I have people that can balance productivity and morale. If you're challenged by that, why should I hire you?"}]]
