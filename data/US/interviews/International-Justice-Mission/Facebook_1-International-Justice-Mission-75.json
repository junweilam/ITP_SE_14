I had nearly a full day of one-on-one interviews with the hiring manager and others across the organization \u2013 from 10:00 to 5:00 \u2013 with a break to attend the morning prayer time with all staff in the office and for lunch with my HR host (which could have been part of the interview process too, for all I knew). Before my day there, I had been given a formal letter with a formal schedule of my interviews. I was told they do this with all candidates \u2013 this long day of interviews \u2013 when they want to see you in person.\r\n\r\nHowever, this formality and thoroughness may not be something to mess with, and it may cost you. When I had received my schedule before the day, I had responded via email with a request to go to lunch with a current employee who is an acquaintance. My email was totally ignored and went unanswered. Also, since it\u2019s a faith-based organization, I pressed the hiring manager a bit, wanting to know how much influence, if any, there was of religious beliefs on any business-related practices or procedures in the office. She took it to mean any influence or pressure on employees to adopt certain religious doctrines, and she responded with a firm no, and I stopped trying to explain what I was getting at. It seems there are high expectations to comply with organizational practices, even if they aren\u2019t dictated or even guided by any religious beliefs. There is a certain rigidity to the organization, and I got the feeling that asking questions about them, even just to understand them, is frowned upon.\r\n\r\nOf course, with so many people interviewing me over the course of the day, I had some repetition of questions, but that wasn\u2019t a big deal. In fact, there was less repetition than I expected, mostly due to another very strange thing: After the interview with the hiring manager, it appeared as if every other person had a script to follow \u2013 a set list of questions to ask me. Nearly every person asked me their questions as if reading from a list. I wanted to ask one of them who gave them that list of questions. Some took notes on a laptop while I answered their questions. They were interesting, probing questions, and this was the thorough part of the interview \u2013 many chances for them to ask about my professional experiences and who I was as a person. Nothing too personal or too off-the-wall (except for one or two questions), but just strangely very thorough \u2013 more so than other organizations.\r\n\r\nEverybody was very warm and friendly, personable and hospitable. They were sympathetic to the fact that it was a day full of interviews and being bombarded with questions. Everybody seemed very professional. Many talked about operating at a high level of excellence and being driven to do that personally and by the culture there. There is an energy in the office to do well, to perform at a very high level, to always be working hard, to always be striving for something even better. It was the usual talk I\u2019ve heard at nonprofits about being committed, dedicated and \u201cmission-driven,\u201d but only at an even higher (almost impossible) level. While this was all admirable, I felt like some of it was a bit artificial, like they were expected to be robots, or that there was a false sense of perfection, that mistakes shouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t be made. I felt almost like I might be inadequate there if I brought any human frailties or weaknesses into the office or position. That, ultimately, might have been why I didn\u2019t make it past this stage.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview, I was told that I would be given a skills test, which would have to be completed at home within 24 hours of the interview. This was the first time I had been told about having to do a skills test, and I was not pleased to have it sprung upon me like that. (Why could I not have been told in my formal letter, which was sent before the interview, or why could they not have done the skills test when I was with them for a full seven hours?) When I got the test very late that same night, it turns out that I had two or three days after all to complete it. I sent it back after a day, but I never heard anything about it \u2013 not even an acknowledgement that they had received it.", "Interview Questions": "Why does Donald Trump use Twitter, and how can his use of it be useful to this organization in advocacy?"}, {"date": "21 Mar 2017", "title": "Recruiting Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at International Justice Mission (Washington, DC)", "Interview Descriptions": "I was first scheduled for a phone interview.
