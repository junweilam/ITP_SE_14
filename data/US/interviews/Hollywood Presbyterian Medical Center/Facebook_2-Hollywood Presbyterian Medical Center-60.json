After that your group gets sent to meet with the Director and a Supervisor of the nursing department. You're all in a small room nervous as all hell and the director informs you about about what they're looking for and answers any common questions from the start. Then they'll ask you when you graduated, when you got your license, where you see yourself in 2 years, and what units you're interested in.
