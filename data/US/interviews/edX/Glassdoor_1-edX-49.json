During the assessment, you are tested on your knowledge, skills, and qualifications related to the job. This exam allows the company to evaluate your understanding of the subject matter and determine if you meet the basic requirements for the role. After completing the assessment, the company provides you with materials to review. These materials could include documents, reports, case studies, or any relevant information that pertains to the position you have applied for. The purpose of this step is to assess your ability to analyze and comprehend complex information within a given timeframe. Once you have thoroughly reviewed the provided materials, the interview process progresses to the presentation stage. In this stage, you are expected to present the findings or insights you have gained from studying the materials. This could involve preparing a formal presentation or delivering a structured explanation of your analysis. The presentation allows the company to evaluate your communication skills, critical thinking abilities, and how well you can articulate and convey information to others. Throughout this assessment, material review, and presentation process, it is crucial to demonstrate your expertise, attention to detail, and the ability to effectively communicate complex concepts.

In 3 different occasions I asked what they wanted from an intern and got the same generic response \"someone who is willing to learn, collaborative etc\" only to learn this particular engineer had never worked with an intern before.
