I was up for two different positions at Barnes and got offered a final round interview for both. The recruiter that I was working with asked my minimum salary requirement, which I told her. She responded by saying that position A won\u2019t be able to meet that requirement, and that position B would be a better fit for that reason. \n\nWith that knowledge from the recruiter, I dropped out of interviews for position A and went to the last round interview with position B. They told me during the interview that they would like to verbally offer me the job, and to look out for a formal offer. The formal offer took 9 weeks to arrive. I went multiple weeks at a time without hearing an update from anyone about where in the process the offer was. \n\nThe worst part, though, was that when I got the offer, the recruiter called me to tell me that the salary they were offering was significantly lower ( by 10k+) than the minimum salary I told them (a minimum that she said was within range for that position when she encouraged me to move forward with this interview over the other position I was interviewing for).  She was very condescending and kept saying things like \u201cI know you gave us your minimum salary requirement but what\u2019s your REAL minimum?\u201d Another disappointing thing was that the salary they offered was less than the salary range listed for position A (which is the one she told me could never meet my minimum). \n\nI probably would\u2019ve considered accepting this offer (even with the salary below my minimum) if I had gotten it under better circumstances. But I just felt manipulated by the time this whole ordeal was over, and I was angry about several other opportunities with other companies that I had turned down after I had gotten my verbal offer from BJC, since the process had taken 9 weeks.

It was the end of the day, the interview schedule had gone past the scheduled time and they appeared tired.  They asked similar behavioral questions, similar to the previous group,.  They also asked \"how\" you completed tasks, interacted with people, how you determined priorities.  It seemed like they were waiting for a pre-determined answer and I could tell that my responses did not hit the keywords they were searching for.  \r\n\r\nThe interview exceeded the time allowed, so I did not get to ask the questions that I had planned to ask.  Each group had a long list of questions and it was evident that they did not allow enough time to get through the list, nor did they allow enough time to probe deeper into some of the questions.  \r\n\r\nThe groups did not describe the position well nor did they describe what they needed in the position; this made it difficult to accurately target responses to show how my experiences would meet their needs.  They preferred to ask all of the questions without giving much guidance, waiting for the candidate to say the magic words.", "Interview Questions": "What is the largest group that you have worked with?"}, {"date": "14 Dec 2015", "title": "Internal Audit Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at BJC HealthCare (Farmington, MO) in Feb 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Standard HR interview with usual questions regarding education and previous employment.
