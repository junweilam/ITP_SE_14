I arrived early and waited for her arrival. When she was over 30 minutes late for our interview, I called her to ask if she would like to reschedule- because I had assumed she had gotten busy or tied up. Well no, she actually completely forgot about the interview SHE scheduled with me. Lovely. She comes down and meets me and does apologize. The interview was one of the strangest interviews I've ever been on. She only asked me one or two questions pertaining to the actual position I was applying for and some how the conversation switched to something extremely casual such as shopping and things going on around the city. I did try quite a few times to shift the conversation back to something that actually pertains to the job, such as my clinical experience but quickly got the vibe that she didn't want to talk about the position and just wanted to get to know me as a person so I just went along with it. At the completion of the interview, I was informed that I had gotten the position. I was asked to not explore other employment opportunities or schedule any other interviews. I was asked to act \"surprised\" when the HR department called me to offer me the job since they like to be the one to tell people they got the job. I thanked her for her time and giving me the chance to be a part of their team as well as expressed my excitement over being offered the position. Well a week or so passes by and I did not receive any phone calls from the HR department. I called her directly and she did not answer, so I left a message. She never called me back and I thought that was strange but figured she was probably very busy and forgot. Fast forward another week and I still haven't heard anything. I tried calling her again and she does not answer. I send her a respectful professional email asking for an update on the process and to let her know I have not heard from the HR Department. She never responds.  Fast forward another week and I decided to call the job recruiter in the HR dept to ask if the position was still available or if it had been filled. I was informed that the position had been filled. I obviously did not get the job. It's quite possible that she interviewed someone after me who had more experience and was a better fit and she hired them instead. I completely 100% understand and respect that decision. What I can not understand nor respect is why she didn't have enough decency to call me or send me a quick email and let me know that. If she would have I would have been spending the past few weeks looking elsewhere for a job instead of assuming that the hiring manager was extremely busy and that their HR department is just slow. I found the whole situation to be very unprofessional and it has changed my opinion on this facility. To ask me not to explore further employment opportunities or schedule any interviews, then offer the position to someone else and not bother to contact me to let me know- is in my opinion pretty unforgiving and not a boss I would want to have. So heads up- if you are offered the position during your interview here- don't bank on it until you've received your offer from the HR dept.
