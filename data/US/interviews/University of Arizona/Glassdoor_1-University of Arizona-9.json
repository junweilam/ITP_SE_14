You can look them up on the universities website to see who you will be interviewing with. I was then asked series of questions, followed by a role play. The questions were fairly simple, but the key is to remember to say that if you can't figure something out to pass it onto the next level technicians to show you are a team player. The role playing consisted of a user calling in who was having an MS Word issue that I exhausted all options with and they still had the issue. The correct answer would have been to try your solutions then pass it onto the next stage technician. Following the role play, I was able to ask questions. Be careful with the questions you ask them! Be very vague and general, nothing that makes the interviewers think too hard. The supervisor for this department does not like being questioned. He felt I asked an unfair question and started to raise his voice to me. I had previously looked up this question online and multiple career sites said it was okay to ask. I asked if my skill set was something that matched well with their department. He did not respond to it directly, said it was unfair of me to ask, and said that he will not give me an answer. Another supervisor of another department answered me in a very general but professional way (the answer I was looking for). The other supervisor told me that they are looking for someone they can mold into what they need, and that experience plays a huge role, but so does personality. Also, do not ask what the time frame is that they will call you back if you are considered. This question also upset him for some reason. There is only 1 female who works in this department and she is blonde and skinny. After looking at the teams website, everyone on the 24/7 team is white. I am Hispanic, and overweight. I feel like looks and race play a huge role to this department. At the very end they let me know that they will let you know within a week if you're considered. Overall, this interview was turned around on me and my questions made me look bad.
