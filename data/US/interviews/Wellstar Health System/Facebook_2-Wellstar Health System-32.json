I asked if she could tell me what the projected salary would be? She stated that the compensation department would review and provide she wouldn't know. At this point I truly was no longer enthused. After the call I heard nothing from both the manager or recruiter for almost 3 1/2 weeks.\n I sent a follow up email to both and received out of office replies.

Four days later, \u201ca walking tour of the facilities\u201d with four of the panel members and the hiring manager.

Even when qualified, the return reply is more often than not an automatic rejection. \r\n\r\nI applied online and was rejected last yr and then received an interview call a month later. They do not follow protocol in the contact method and HR does not care about your concerns that they do not follow protocol in the hiring process. The person running the HR hiring dept responded to an email I wrote in an unprofessional manner. I had called  (she was never available and did not return calls) asking about interview follow through post-interview and correct chain in the hiring process. No one has job security these days including HR hiring managers. It is incredible to have such a sloppy hiring system combined with unprofessional email transmissions.\r\n\r\nTry to apply online? Get used to the categorical rejection without so much as an call. But they list and relist these jobs almost weekly. Either they cannot retain those hired or they need to meet regulations  on listing.\r\n\r\nThey do NOT care how qualified you are. \r\n\r\nAnother student in my school recounted a similar no follow through interview. She was interviewed by several of would be co workers and never heard back from the hiring interviewer. If you get an interview (rare) then be prepared to be set before a group of peers who get to decide if you are hired or not. No previous review of your resume.
