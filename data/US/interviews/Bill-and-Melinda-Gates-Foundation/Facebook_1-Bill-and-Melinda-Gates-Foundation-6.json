I emailed a contact I have there as soon as I applied, and I think the referral I got from her helped me to get through the resume screening process (the recruiter later told me they had hundreds of applicants for the position). The recruiter set up a time to talk to me and told me to plan for about a 45-minute call. We ended up talking for less than half an hour, and it was all very basic (i.e. questions about my resume and background and lots of time for me to ask questions). She told me I would hear back the next week and the following week I got an email to set up a time to talk to the hiring manager. This conversation was around 45 minutes and was more questions about my resume and experience. A few days after that I heard from a different recruiter who set up a time for me to come in, and I spent four hours at the Foundation the following week (this is now a month after the initial contact). I spoke to the people I will be working with as well as higher-level people and the recruiter. Most of the questions were again about my background, and everyone I spoke to gave me time to ask questions as well. This is not an interview where anyone will try to trick you, and it's much more about making sure the person they hire is a good fit and is dedicated to the mission of the organization.

They were very gracious in all e-mail to me, thanking me for considering employment there.  Given the recent economy and some people still not working, they treated me like I was considering them more than the other way around.\r\n\r\nI had a recruiter phone interview first.  Very nice woman and we had a good conversation.  (Now that I'm with the company, we still keep in touch.)  We discussed my past experience and qualifications.  Normal first interview type of questions.  At the end of that call, she discussed the salary and the benefits.  That was helpful.  I had been working at a for-profit for 14 years and thought I would be offered less money.  I was very surprised to find that I would be making at least as much, if not more at the Gates Foundation. Plus, the benefits are amaziningly better and there's a pension contribution that is given (not based on tenure or job level).\r\n\r\nNext, I was set up for all day interviews.  I was actually being considered for 2 different jobs.  I interviewed with 6 people that day in a conference room.  They very nicely had me pre-order lunch but I was in the conference room all day w/ no breaks.  Even my lunch was an interview.  I didn't eat much as it is awkward to interview and eat (plus, I would have no doubt gotten something stuck in my teeth and that was not the impression I wanted to leave w/ anyone!).\r\n\r\nI knew my chances were very good after that series of interviews.  I rec'd good feedback and thought I had a good showing.  However, I did go back for 2 more interviews late on a Friday afternoon.  It was to meet the director of the dept and a person who would be my co-worker (who wasn't available during the first round).\r\n\r\nAgain, things went well and I thought I might hear next steps the following week.  I was blown away when the recruiter called my cell phone before I had even arrived home.  I called her back and she verbally gave me the job offer on a Friday night at 6:30pm!  Throughout my experiences, everyone was really great, respectful, and complimentary. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that gave me pause was what I was hearing through my background research (I knew people who had contracted with the Foundation) and even existing employees mentioned this during the interview.  That is, that it can be a hard place to work and to get things done.  The reasons mentioned were that it is still a young company, working on process and organizational maturity.  I see that is true now that I'm here.  However, it's also exciting to be part of that building process.  It has a bit of a start-up feel.  People are really passionate and want to make a difference.  Both in the world through the Foundation's mission, but also at the company.

I ate lunch alone, in the room (it was explained that they seem to think that people like a breather to be on their own. er, lunch w/ potential co-workers is where you get a real sense of what it is like to work there.. so that was concerning). You do not get to see where you will work, or who co-workers are aside from those involved in the interview. Interview Qs depended upon the person, but for the most part clearly untrained in determining best fit. A few illegal Qs thrown in, but I think these were ignorance over intentional fact finding. Major attitude w/ junior peers, which is to be expected, I suppose. Not one person could clearly explain how things work or identify specific projects or tasks- everything described in a vague sort of way. I got the distinct sense that decisions are not made easily, or by any specific person or persons. The environment described as collegiate, but seems more like \"under managed\" is more accurate. Initial follow up emails were not responded to (probably because I wasn't going to be offered the job, but still. \"nice to meet you, too\" - is that so difficult?). I don't think they would've bothered to tell me that I wasn't going to be offered the position if I hadn't been diligent about following up. My criticisms are not coming from bitterness- to be honest, if I had been offered the job it would've been a difficult decision. Something was not right, and I got the feeling that I was not given an accurate picture of what the job really entailed (despite direct questioning) or what the environment was really like- it was like talking to politicians.
