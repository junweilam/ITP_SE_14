I also needed to have two letters of recommendation submitted since I was selected for an interview. (There was contradicting information on the website and what was said at the info session about who exactly could write the LOR, and what email to send the LOR. There also wasn't any hard deadline given for the recommendations. When I asked these questions via email I got no response.)\r\n\r\nI came in for an interview in early April. Before the interview, I believe it was an HR rep who sent an email with details of how to get to the hospital, the position in general, and the name of the manager I'd interview with.  I also had to email this person my CPR card and fill out background check info before the interview day. On the day of the interview, the manager at the hospital I applied for met me in the lobby and took me to her office for the interview. I did not receive her contact information, so unfortunately I could not thank her for the interview via email/message afterwards.
