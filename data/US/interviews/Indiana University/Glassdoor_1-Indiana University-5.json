I followed up with the Admissions Department, but never heard back from my follow-up email. A few months later, I was asked for a Zoom interview and I accepted.\r\n\r\nThe interview went well. They had 3-4 people on the call asking questions and everyone was welcoming and kind. \r\n\r\nThey called me in for an in-person interview after that, which they said would last for 2 hours if I am remembering correctly. When I came in to interview, they had the team interview me in a conference room, which went well. I then had a tour of the campus and had two more interviews-- one with staff from other departments, and one with a higher up in Admissions.\r\n\r\nThis is when things got a bit odd. While I was in the third interview with the higher up, she went on her phone and started texting during the interview even though she also said there was no emergency. I thought this was odd, but then the interview time went over by an hour. I felt as though this was not respectful of my time. She had also called in an employee who had asked for paid time off that day (and he had been accepted for that PTO), and she told him she wanted him to be in the office that day in order to help interview me. This showed me that the Admissions Department didn't seem to have a culture of having work-life balance and healthy boundaries. I felt bad that this employee had to come into work after he had already been approved to have the day off. \r\n\r\nI was still interested in the position at this point though, so I was looking forward to hearing back from them after the in-person interviews. The higher up said she would let me know their decision by Wednesday of the next week. When the next week came around, I never received any email or form of communication from the school. (Even if they needed more time to decide, I think it would have been conscientious and respectful to communicate that on the Wednesday that I was looking to hear back from them). \r\n\r\nBy Tuesday of the following week (so nearly a week late), they emailed me and asked for another interview where I would be asked to do a 20 minute presentation. I love presentations and didn't mind this particular request, but I found it disrespectful that they were a week late in communicating when they easily could have said they were going to get back to me a little later, and they were asking for another interview when they had let on to giving me a decision on my employment during this time. I decided to decline their additional interview offer, but I believe I did so kindly. They never responded to my email.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt as though my time had been sorely wasted, and I was not happy with this process and the lack of clear communication.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us how you keep track of multiple projects at the same time."}, {"date": "20 Jul 2022", "title": "Biostatistician Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Indiana University", "Interview Descriptions": "Long all day process with about 30 people.

You must apply through the Jobs@IU website - do not send your resume and cover letter to the department head directly!  The outcome will not be good.  I've worked for the university for several years and I can tell you that for the most part the dept. head will be annoyed at best if you send your application directly to him/her.  What makes a good impression is addressing your cover letter to the hiring manager (you can locate the name of that individual by looking at the departmental website - if you paid attention to the job description, you'll have a good idea of who will be your future boss!). \r\n\r\nWhen you send in your application, someone from HR will look at your resume/cover letter and, if you meet the minimum qualifications, they'll send your application on to the hiring manager.  At that point all you can really do is wait to be contacted.  You'll be able to see when they start interviewing because under the status field, you'll see \"HR Approved\" (basically they're still reviewing resumes), \"Interviewing\" (they've started interviews) and \"Filled\" (someone accepted an offer).  \r\n\r\nInterviews really vary depending on the department.  I've interviewed with just my potential supervisor, with a few people from the office, and with the entire office.  Usually the questions are behavior based, so try to think of many different scenarios related to the job description and craft a response as to how you'd react.  Of course you'll get your standard run-of-the-mill questions like \"tell me about yourself\" and \"what interested you in the position?\"  But primarily the questions are behavior based.\r\n\r\nThen after the interview they'll generally give you a timeline.  Respect the timeline and don't follow up until a few days after the \"you'll-know-by\" date.  Things happen and I think my aggression cost me a job offer earlier in the year.  Send your thank-you notes, though!  Those are always important.\r\n\r\nSomething important to consider when applying: if a department is hiring for more than one position, ONLY APPLY FOR ONE OF THE OPEN JOBS.  If you apply for more than one, the hiring manager will scrap your application because they'll have the impression that you're after just any old job out there.  I've heard this from three of my bosses in different positions.  So choose carefully!\r\n\r\nIU loves enthusiasm - so be sure to show it if you really care about the department or type of work you'd be doing (such as student services, PR, alumni relations, or whatever else it is that you love to do).  \r\n\r\nThat's about all I got :) Good luck!!!", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "3 Nov 2015", "title": "Box Office Clerk Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Indiana University (Bloomington, IN) in Jul 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Submission of resume and one informal interview.

I followed up with the Admissions Department, but never heard back from my follow-up email. A few months later, I was asked for a Zoom interview and I accepted.\r\n\r\nThe interview went well. They had 3-4 people on the call asking questions and everyone was welcoming and kind. \r\n\r\nThey called me in for an in-person interview after that, which they said would last for 2 hours if I am remembering correctly. When I came in to interview, they had the team interview me in a conference room, which went well. I then had a tour of the campus and had two more interviews-- one with staff from other departments, and one with a higher up in Admissions.\r\n\r\nThis is when things got a bit odd. While I was in the third interview with the higher up, she went on her phone and started texting during the interview even though she also said there was no emergency. I thought this was odd, but then the interview time went over by an hour. I felt as though this was not respectful of my time. She had also called in an employee who had asked for paid time off that day (and he had been accepted for that PTO), and she told him she wanted him to be in the office that day in order to help interview me. This showed me that the Admissions Department didn't seem to have a culture of having work-life balance and healthy boundaries. I felt bad that this employee had to come into work after he had already been approved to have the day off. \r\n\r\nI was still interested in the position at this point though, so I was looking forward to hearing back from them after the in-person interviews. The higher up said she would let me know their decision by Wednesday of the next week. When the next week came around, I never received any email or form of communication from the school. (Even if they needed more time to decide, I think it would have been conscientious and respectful to communicate that on the Wednesday that I was looking to hear back from them). \r\n\r\nBy Tuesday of the following week (so nearly a week late), they emailed me and asked for another interview where I would be asked to do a 20 minute presentation. I love presentations and didn't mind this particular request, but I found it disrespectful that they were a week late in communicating when they easily could have said they were going to get back to me a little later, and they were asking for another interview when they had let on to giving me a decision on my employment during this time. I decided to decline their additional interview offer, but I believe I did so kindly. They never responded to my email.\r\n\r\nOverall, I felt as though my time had been sorely wasted, and I was not happy with this process and the lack of clear communication.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us how you keep track of multiple projects at the same time."}, {"date": "20 Jul 2022", "title": "Biostatistician Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Indiana University", "Interview Descriptions": "Long all day process with about 30 people.

You must apply through the Jobs@IU website - do not send your resume and cover letter to the department head directly!  The outcome will not be good.  I've worked for the university for several years and I can tell you that for the most part the dept. head will be annoyed at best if you send your application directly to him/her.  What makes a good impression is addressing your cover letter to the hiring manager (you can locate the name of that individual by looking at the departmental website - if you paid attention to the job description, you'll have a good idea of who will be your future boss!). \r\n\r\nWhen you send in your application, someone from HR will look at your resume/cover letter and, if you meet the minimum qualifications, they'll send your application on to the hiring manager.  At that point all you can really do is wait to be contacted.  You'll be able to see when they start interviewing because under the status field, you'll see \"HR Approved\" (basically they're still reviewing resumes), \"Interviewing\" (they've started interviews) and \"Filled\" (someone accepted an offer).  \r\n\r\nInterviews really vary depending on the department.  I've interviewed with just my potential supervisor, with a few people from the office, and with the entire office.  Usually the questions are behavior based, so try to think of many different scenarios related to the job description and craft a response as to how you'd react.  Of course you'll get your standard run-of-the-mill questions like \"tell me about yourself\" and \"what interested you in the position?\"  But primarily the questions are behavior based.\r\n\r\nThen after the interview they'll generally give you a timeline.  Respect the timeline and don't follow up until a few days after the \"you'll-know-by\" date.  Things happen and I think my aggression cost me a job offer earlier in the year.  Send your thank-you notes, though!  Those are always important.\r\n\r\nSomething important to consider when applying: if a department is hiring for more than one position, ONLY APPLY FOR ONE OF THE OPEN JOBS.  If you apply for more than one, the hiring manager will scrap your application because they'll have the impression that you're after just any old job out there.  I've heard this from three of my bosses in different positions.  So choose carefully!\r\n\r\nIU loves enthusiasm - so be sure to show it if you really care about the department or type of work you'd be doing (such as student services, PR, alumni relations, or whatever else it is that you love to do).  \r\n\r\nThat's about all I got :) Good luck!!!", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "3 Nov 2015", "title": "Box Office Clerk Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Indiana University (Bloomington, IN) in Jul 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Submission of resume and one informal interview.
