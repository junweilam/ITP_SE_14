Technical difficulties aside (also not really their fault), it was clear that the design position was more UX and not simply graphic design. They should be more clear about their goals in filling the position in the posting, as well as the recruiter interview. I've always been upfront that I don't do backend work but it seemed to take the panel by surprise. \nIt was clearly not a fit, but the frustrating aspect was after the interview was complete I sent 3 emails to the recruiter thanking her for the time and if there was any update. She never responded to any of the messages which is extremely unprofessional. I don't believe ghosting is a good recruiting strategy. I definitely won't be reapplying for any future roles at this company.", "Interview Questions": "Asked about my design process.

I found it interesting that the ladies that interviewed me have their positions, and are empowered to hire or not to hire, because neither of them are college graduates, they are high school grads only.  How can you be qualified to have the critical thinking skills necessary to be a lead without paying the education dues?  Also, they came up the easy way in the insurance industry through clerical or salary jobs not business to business x-dating and hard core or commission sales, but they can decide who gets their cushy sales position.
