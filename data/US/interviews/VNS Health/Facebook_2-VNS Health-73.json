I had a screening call with a recruiter. I then had a 30 minute interview with the hiring manager/potential supervisor, a 45 minute interview with 2 staff members of the compliance team, a 45 minute interview with 2 staff members of the RA team, a 45 min interview with the AVPs of Govt. Affairs and Compliance, and a 45 minute interview with the CCO and another director. I was also asked to submit a writing sample. This entire process took 3 months, just for me to receive a call from the recruiter stating that they're reconsidering the role due to budget concerns. The recruiter told me that I will receive a follow-up call from her if they decide to go with another candidate, or if this team wishes to extend an offer to me. You would think these people would have the common sense to confirm their budget BEFORE a job posting was made public. These people (the C-suite) have absolutely no respect for their candidates. How exactly do you expect to command any respect from a future employee if this is how you treated them during the interview process? These people have ZERO regard for someone else's time and dedication to this process. Again, how do you expect to have someone show any loyalty or dedication to this role if this is how you treated them? Honestly, if they made me an offer today, I'd reject it. This process has been an absolute sh*t show, this is an obvious reflection of the people running this team and I want no part of it. I feel like I dodged a bullet. *Please note that the reason I rated this interview process as \"very difficult\" was not because of the questions asked. The interview questions weren't challenging, each interview felt like a normal conversation to me. The \"difficult\" part about the last 3 months was the lack of communication I received from these people. I had to be the one reaching out to them every week for updates.", "Interview Questions": "Most interviews started with \"tell me about yourself\" - that's where you can talk about your current role, how you got there, and why you're looking to pursue this role.

Finally, after the 4th interview, I was told they were very interested in offering me a position, but there's been yet another change: This time, a more junior role and a significant cut in salary.\n\nI found everyone I spoke with at VNSNY to be incredibly professional and personable. I felt great about every single interview, and the rapport I had with each person. Moreover, they all seemed to truly enjoy working at VNSNY, which was great to observe as a job candidate.\n\nBut of course, all of that goodness and goodwill quickly disappears when there is so much ambiguity, upheaval, and uncertainty about their actual hiring needs. Flashing red lights that they don't know this much about their organization's needs before starting the process of recruiting candidates. It also seemed as if they were slugging through molasses to move the process along -- 2.5 months is insane.\n\nI am choosing to view this as good interview prep.
