This company is truly disorganized and unprofessional. I initially interviewed with the hiring manager who admitted they use a combination of proprietary and outdated tech. He also mentioned that his subordinates would entirely be making the hiring decision, not him. (Not a wise choice, as mangers tend to hire for talent and team members seem to filter out anyone they perceive as competition.) Against my better judgment, I decided to move forward to the next round because the manager and I got along well despite the red flags. His team...yikes. They were not on the same page as their manager at all. They contradicted most of what he told me about the position and badmouthed him several times during the interview. When asked why they were hiring for this role, they gave a very defensive non-explanation claiming they didn't actually need another data engineer because they were so good at their jobs. Sure... They also seemed to not be keeping up with current tech in the data sector and were threatened by my experience. When I was talking about basic cloud data warehousing concepts like file staging, one of the interviewers cut me off to falsely assert that I was making the whole thing up because he had never heard of it. The most concerning thing about this team is that they don't even seem to care about the non-profit they're working for. When asked what his favorite thing about working for ANTHC was, one interviewer actually said \"the health insurance\" and nothing else. Wow. Naturally, they ghosted me after the interview. Huge bullet dodged, and a newfound appreciation for my current job.", "Interview Questions": "There aren't many questions, strangely. They abruptly told me to share my screen for a poorly organized coding test. They admitted that everyone they interview is confused by the instructions, but still have not bothered to fix it. If you try to jot down any notes or organize your thoughts on a different screen, they will accuse you of cheating (with raised voices)."}, {"date": "18 Oct 2022", "title": "Health Facilities Engineer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium", "Interview Descriptions": "This company is very disorganized and unprofessional. I received an email about a month after applying that I had been selected to interview for the position. The interview was simple, and took about an hour. After the interview I received no correspondence from either the company or the interviewers. A week after the interview I inquired if I was still under consideration and received no response. I waited 45 days with no response whatsoever when I sent another email inquiring if the position was still available. I shortly after received a very condescending and unprofessional message implying that I should have taken the company's radio silence as meaning that I was no longer a candidate (despite the company website that I applied through still listing me as \"under consideration\"). I understand sometimes the interview process can take a bit of time but everything about this process was incredibly disorganized, even setting up a time for the interview was unnecessarily difficult.

Within days of my application, I received a computer-generated notification that I would not be selected for the interview process. Imagine my surprise when I was contacted on May 3 for an interview. A member of the data team (Analytics Architect) contacted me via email to request a phone screen, which took place a few days later. Following the phone screen, the same individual contacted me for an interview with the rest of the team  (which took place a few days later -- I liked the team). About a week later, I interviewed with the same individual and the director of the department. The interview proceeded as one would expect, until I was asked about availability. As I am relocating from the lower 48, I mentioned that while I could be available within two weeks, I would appreciate the ability to work remotely for a brief period of time while selling my home. I was told that it takes CEO approval for anyone at the company to work remotely, and that I would need to be there within two weeks. Following the interview, I wrote a 'thank you' email to the folks that I interviewed with (as I had done every step of the way). The following day, I was surprised to see that one of the people that received the 'thank you' had inadvertently replied to my email with a negative comment about another applicant (to his credit, he caught the blunder and attempted to recall the email). After not hearing anything for about a week, I followed up and was told that they were still in process. I next heard from them after 42 days of silence, where they asked for references -- indicating that they wished to proceed further. Upon providing references as requested, I asked to speak with someone about benefits. I was told that he would send my request to the recruiting department -- and I never heard back. After both of my references gave glowing reviews of my past and present performance, I received a system-generated email stating that I had not made the cut. \r\n\r\nRed Flags:\r\n1 - Why did I received a system-generated rejection email before I was contacted by them?\r\n2 - This was advertised as a \"Relocate to Alaska\" position. Do they really think that it's reasonable to expect someone moving cross country to be there in two weeks? \r\n3 - Ghosting an applicant for 42 days isn't okay.  \r\n4 - Calling an applicant's references without the intent of offering a position isn't okay. \r\n5 - Sending a system-generated rejection email after having invested two months and going so far through the process is unprofessional. \r\n6 - Why not allow an applicant to speak with a member of HR for benefits questions? Seems suspicious to me. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I found this process to be alarmingly amateur and unprofessional. I never spoke with any recruiter or HR member -- my only contact was with the team. The process was the slowest I've ever experienced -- as a matter of fact, another recruiter in the area commented about how slowly ANTHC's recruiting efforts drudge along. Fortunately, I am accepting a position that pays $35k more, and will allow me a period of remote time while my family relocates.", "Interview Questions": "Basic questions about reporting, ETL, etc., as well as a question about the various uses for a paper clip.
