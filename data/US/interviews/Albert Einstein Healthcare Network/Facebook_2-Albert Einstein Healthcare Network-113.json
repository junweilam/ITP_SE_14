She was very responsive, polite and informative. The process however after speaking with the recruiter became very unorganized and less than professional. There was a clear disconnect between the hiring department and HR. I was not sure who the decision maker was even though it was clear who was supposed to be the head of the department. It seemed as if they were too distracted with other concerns rather than fairly and diligently evaluating my experience and qualifications. I felt as if I was only part of the candidate pool because of a necessary standard and I do not feel as if I was taken seriously. It seemed as if they had a favorite or candidate already selected and they did not do a good job being discreet about it. When I arrived for my final interview only 2 out of the 6 people scheduled to meet with me showed up and was asked to meet with someone else who was not originally scheduled to meet with me as part of an obvious stall tactic while they tried to give the rest of the people time to arrive who never did. It also seemed very clear that the expectations of the role had not been explained to all stakeholders and it caused for a very awkward interview. I did not receive specific feedback after being told I was not selected. The best part about this experience was that I was able to see early on that this department within this company was dysfunctional and consistently overwhelmed and understaffed which makes me ok with not being offered the position.", "Interview Questions": "What is my Leadership style?"}, {"date": "17 Nov 2015", "title": "Registered Nurse Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Albert Einstein Healthcare Network (Norristown, PA) in Aug 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "first a telephone interview with a nurse recruiter, asking simple questions about my experience.
