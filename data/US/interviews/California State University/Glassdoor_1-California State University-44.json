I've been in a number of interviews in my career and this has got to be the worst one I've ever had. I literally started getting annoyed mid-interview when they were asking me questions that 1) were covered in both my resume and cover letter had they read it prior to meeting 2) answers I already discussed or covered when I talked about my background, but instead of listening or having a conversation, all 3 participants were looking at questions and reading from their screens. Did not make eye contact at all until finishing their question and looking up. It was just awful and I was so offended by the lack of genuine interest in a candidate they showed. They all seemed like they didn't want to be there, which then made me feel uncomfortable.
