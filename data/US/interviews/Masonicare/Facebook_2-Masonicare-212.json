All standard process, but I certainly dodged a bullet here. The initial salary range was 80-90k and the schedule was hybrid, completely lowballed during the second interview when it changed to 75k and on-site only. Lots of red flags with taking on responsibility of other departments such as networking while management relaxes at home. On call rotation didn\u2019t sound too bad but lots of \u201cyou\u2019ll be drinking from the fire hose\u201d comments.

I was cold-called by a member of their staff who sent me an email on LinkedIn and a Voice Message on my personal phone that I would be a 'fantastic fit' for an open role with their firm.  I made arrangements to leave my job early and travel approximately 30 miles to attend an interview at their corporate location.  I followed-up the interview with appropriate thank you letters to both interviewers.\r\n\r\nAfter 3 weeks I contacted the recruiter and left a polite message reaffirming my interest in the role and asking if she would mind letting me know if I was still being consideration.  I never received a response.\r\n\r\nI understand that rejection is part of the job-search process.  But I do believe that if a recruiter is going to engage in 'cold-calling', making unsolicited calls to already-employed potential candidates that result in a candidate taking the time and effort to personally show up for a 60-minute interview, it is just common courtesy and the professional RESPONSIBILITY of that recruiter to follow-up with a timely status report or decision.  A simple boiler-plate rejection letter or timeline for a decision would suffice.\r\n\r\nAs a professional, my time is very valuable.  Regardless of whether a candidate is the 'right fit' - or not - as a recruiter, it is your responsibility to treat potential candidates with the professional courtesy they deserve, as well as represent your company vis-a-vis the highest professional standards.   As an HR professional with nearly 30 years of work experience I believe that respect and courtesy is essential in dealing with the public.", "Interview Questions": "Do you think you would be happy in this sort of environment?"}, {"date": "8 Jun 2019", "title": "Clinician Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Masonicare (Wallingford, CT) in Aug 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "Started with a phone interview with HR followed by an in person interview with clinical supervisor.
