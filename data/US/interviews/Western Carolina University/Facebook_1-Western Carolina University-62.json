Dinner with interview committee, day of interviews, research and teaching talks, meeting with various HR. Met with students at my request. Third day meeting with \"higher ups\", both of whom kind of grilled me, and didn't seem especially interested in answering my questions.  Everyone was very polite and professional.\r\n\r\nSome of my questions were not answered, or were given vague answers. E.g., no information on salaries would be provided. Answers suggested that research start up was limited to a few thousand dollars, and there were no research lab facilities associated with the position. Internal funding for research expenses (annual funding) is good - fairly easy to get annual grants of $5000 to $10,000 from the university system. North Carolina Universities do not offer sabbaticals (there is something alternate you can apply for but they are often rejected). Health care cost for family is about $6500 annually, which comes out of salary. Raises for successful promotion to associate and full professor are flat rates of around $4000 and $6000, if I remember correctly. I was informed that most people do make tenure. The culture of the program seemed very healthy and good, and there was a very strong interest in the well being of the students.\r\n\r\nDid not follow up with me for 2 months - I inquired with search chair and immediate received a canned rejection email from HR. I requested feedback from the search committee chair on my interview (how to improve, etc.) and received an email that the search committee does not make the decisions (the higher ups do) and so they have no feedback to give. So as a growth experience, the interview was not very valuable.", "Interview Questions": "A handout of 10 questions was provided, and there was 60 minutes to answer.
