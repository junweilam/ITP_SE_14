Six sets of numbers (3-8 digits) in each line and 2 of the 6 numbers set are identical) you circle the 2 identical numbers.  In 10 minutes you circle as much as you can.  Next is the essay question.  I don\u2019t remember the exact wording but the question is asking what cause the ER to overflow in hospital and how can you address this problem.  They give you 10 minutes for the essay.  The next part is more questions.  They give each interviewee a package (5-7pages) of questions.  And ask you to choose 4 number from 7 -20 and write on the front of the packet.  You must answer all of the first 7 questions, and 4 more question which ever 4 number you wrote on the front of the packet corresponding to the questions.
