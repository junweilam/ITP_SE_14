Show how better you are at OOP, you are free to do anything just keep in mind that you need to convince them that you know OOP better than the other candidates. (you have 1h 30min) 2. Debbugging problem . Fairly easy debuuging problem. You will need to go through some documentation to get it but it's okay. (you have 30min) 3. Adding features. You have 4 problems, starting from the code you just debugged, you need to solve 4 more exercises which pretty much mean to add 4 new features. This is the most challengin problem and I dont think you got enough time to solve them all (2h 30 min) Overall, a negative experience. I went there at 9am and I left at 5pm. It was like a full working ( and probably that's what they probably want) which was very exhausting and unnecessary if they wanted to determine what candidate is good for them. Also, after spending ~8 hours and solving all of their problems besides the lase exercise on the last problem, I got refused without any feedback. Just imagine having a candidate spending 8 hours at your HQs and doing almost everything you tell them just to refuse them and not even tell him what he did wrong. Bad experience, I would advise you not to go there.", "Interview Questions": "I already specified them ."}, {"date": "14 Dec 2021", "title": "Project Manager Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at SBP", "Interview Descriptions": "Seamless interview process and easy communication with recruiter. \nIt felt more like a conversation than an interview. \n\nInterviewer was timely, prompt and respectful. \n\nThe interview was over the phone, which I probably preferred.
