I was hesitant at first, but after a few emails I decided to give it a chance. \r\n\r\nOverall, the phone interview was a little bit uncomfortable and odd. The manager stated that this role would be responsible for fundraising for part of their own salary. This would include asking for donations from family, friends and different organizations. \r\n\r\nThe manager then asked, \"are you religious or of Christian faith?\" After I told him that I didn't necessarily follow a specific religion, he stated that \"unfortunately if you were to be put up against candidates who were of Christian faith, they would have the upper hand.\" \r\n\r\nI understand that Intervarsity's mission is to promote the Christian faith, but to make someone feel inferior because of their religion is unacceptable. If I knew that this organization was this strict about religion, I wouldn't have gone through with the phone interview.", "Interview Questions": "Are you religious?
