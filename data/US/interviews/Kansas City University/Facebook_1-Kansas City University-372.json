I filled out resume online & heard from HR within 1 week to set up interview.  The PI I interviewed with was friendly & personable.   Asked me about my experience,  my role in my prior labs research projects & papers.   The PI went over their research interests & current projects.  I was then taken in a tour of the research department.  Every individual I met was friendly,  seemed genuine and quite competent.   The facility's equipment was limited,  not a surprise given its size (such as 2 high quality lab water units & 1 hood for the entire building), but a majority of it recent.  What was older was quite dated,  some of the biosafety hoods were > 20 yrs with difficult to use metal sashes. The 1 fume hood for the building was completely filled with various bottles, pipet waste, beakers, waste  & had me wondering about the state of the EHS department.  The tour concluded the interview.   I refrained from inquiring about the university's benefits,  advancement opportunities & other training opportunities for a follow-up interview if there was to be one.    I did find out that the interviewer contacted not only my listed references, but researched my past labs' staff listing to contact some of them for their assesment of my performance (I'm not sure prospective emplorers are able to do that).  There was no 2nd interview,  which I found surprising, & a position was offered.", "Interview Questions": "What type of work environment would your ideal?"}, {"date": "29 Aug 2015", "title": "Financial Aid Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Kansas City University (Kansas City, MO) in Apr 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview took about 5 hours total.
