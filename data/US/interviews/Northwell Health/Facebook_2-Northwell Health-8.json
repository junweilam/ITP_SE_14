At one location it took about a week after applying for them to get back to me. I had a phone screening interview, then an in person interview with the nurse manager and assistant nurse manager. The interview was very generic, and they seemed disinterested the whole time and just reading through set questions. I'm not sure whether that's because they had found their candidate and were just bored or if it was me, but it only took about 15 minutes. The questions were easy, but they never even explained anything about the unit or position until I asked them to. The recruiter had stated in his email to contact him once I had finished my interview. I did, a few different times over a month. No one ever contacted me back. The position was never filled. This has been my experience that they never contact you back if they don't want you, so you're left hanging forever.", "Interview Questions": "What kind of preventative measures can you name for patients at risk for falls?"}, {"date": "18 Aug 2018", "title": "Patient Care Associate Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Northwell Health (New York, NY) in Aug 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied online after being referred by two employees at Northwell Health.
