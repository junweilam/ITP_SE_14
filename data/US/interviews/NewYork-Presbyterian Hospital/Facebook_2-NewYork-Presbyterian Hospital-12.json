Remain concise and on topic!  \r\n- Don't forget to write down your questions so you won't forget them! I actually printed out a special copy of my resume with my questions and a one line bullet point for a lot of my prepared answers printed on the back so in case i drew a blank i could take a peak, but in the end the process of writing it down helped me to remember anyway so I didn't even have to refer to it. \r\n-Be aware of your body language \r\n- Email a thank you note to all of your interviewers! Try to include something you talked about or learned during the interview to personalize it, ex \"it really resonated w me that we discussed..\" \r\n\r\nAbove all, go in with a can do attitude and your best professional look and be yourself!

Here's a summary to keep it short:\r\n\r\n1. I was given an impromptu phone interview...\r\n...It was preceded with an email asking to schedule a time, however I had not yet responded and got an unexpected call with phone interview questions a day or two later. Luckily I was generally prepared and available.\r\n\r\n2. I was given ambiguous instructions as to where to arrive for my in-person interview and nearly blamed when I was not in the exactly correct meeting place...\r\n...I managed to seat myself just a few feet from the correct location (next to a door I was supposed to ring a bell to enter, against the wall of the waiting area I was supposed to be seated in), but the interviewer walked right past me without checking if I was the interviewee (the only person waiting in business attire on the only bench in a narrow main lobby) and then called me a few minutes after the scheduled time to imply \"you're not here.\" She then admitted as we walked to the interview room that she \"thought it was me\" yet hadn't said anything.\r\n\r\n3. I was given a pharmacology exam and provided no study materials/suggestions for content and vague instructions to find the testing location...\r\n... the location was in a service building with no official entrance and locked doors that required a company ID to enter (which I had no yet received).\r\n\r\n4. The background check instructions and links were never sent to me...\r\n... I was called and provided verbal instructions as to what I needed to do for onboarding, my point person told me \"don't take notes, it will all be in the email.\" The email had zero instructions for a background check, then I was called a week later asking why I hadn't filled out the background check.\r\n\r\n5. The background check itself then took such a long time that my start date had to be pushed back a month...\r\n...There were 2 'discrepancies' on my background check and it took them over 3 WEEKS to verify the two simple discrepancies (aka make 2 phone calls). \r\n\r\n6. I was given instructions by one point person that unofficial transcripts were acceptable, then told after sending them via email that they were not acceptable....\r\n\r\n7. My start date was pushed back 1 month over the phone, and I was given the WRONG DATE...\r\n...With my original Monday start date looming on a Friday afternoon, still with ZERO information regarding an orientation meeting time/place, I was told verbally that my start date would be pushed back, then provided ZERO written confirmation. When what I thought was 1 week before my start date had arrived and I still had zero starting info, I called my point person and was told \"you're supposed to be here RIGHT NOW.\" Turned out that I was given a week late start date, sent an email 2 business days before the actual start date.\r\n\r\n8. I was told by my point person the night before my start date that I \"had to show up this time\" after being given the wrong date by that very person one month prior. \r\n\r\n9. I missed vital information and activities, a previously planned trip to visit family, an entire day of pay, and a day's worth of work time allotted to learning what I would need to know in my position with no guidance on how to remedy my predicament ... \r\n...My first day of work involved having to explain to people why I was unprepared and trying to track down things that were fundamental to my continuing to work the next day. This, all while missing a previously planned trip to visit family that cost me $400. I also had to file about 8 documents the following week due to the clocking-in/out system not recognizing me. Then I was made to attend the first day I had missed on a date I was scheduled to learn concepts I would need for doing my job and was expected to catch up on my own time.\r\n\r\n10.

However, the second half was not the same.  \r\n\r\nI met with the Manager Operations Food and Nutrition and two other managers I assume. The director was pleasant. The other two were rude and unprofessional.  Whenever I didn't understand the question or answer it wrong they snickered and laughs like middle schoolers. One was looking up at the ceiling looking around and the other looking at her watch. I can definitely feel their energy as they checked out of the interview. I felt judged and so uncomfortable.  \r\n\r\nThis honestly is a bummer.  They are about to launch new systems and programs and I want to be part of it. I am extremely passionate about hospitality. food service, and team building. I put 100% in everything I do.  I firmly believe I would be a great addition to this team. \r\n\r\nI still appreciate this opportunity to interview with them. I learned a lot about this industry and I will make sure to work on my skills and build on areas I am lacking on in order to be confident and transition into healthcare. Looking back, I was not fully prepared and that is on me to make sure I dot all my I\u2019s and cross all my T\u2019s.

Why? Because they are customers or potential customers and we have to make sure they continue to be fans and support our business.  The last thing I want is to leave a bad taste in their mouth. \r\n\r\nI honestly do not know if they will even offer me the position. Most likely they won\u2019t and I am content with that. To be quite honest, they probably will not even read this. But if they do, I want them to understand that they should always respect anyone they interview with. Even if you think they are a joke.

I believe it was back in 2012. I applied through my university's job bank and received a phone call to schedule an interview. During the phone call they asked me why I chose pharmacy, my GPA, and brief general questions about me. I then had an interview with the HR staff. I remember it was a young white male that had interview me. The front HR secretary was a young asian lady that took a copy of my intern license. \r\n\r\nDuring the interview process, the HR guy was friendly, but he was literally just asking me questions that were pre-written from a gathered list. I honestly thought the questions he asked me were not relevant to my field nor the position I was applying for. I remember he would ask me a management question, when I was applying for a pharmacy intern position. He was reading off the list and told me I was allowed to skip/not answer one question. In my opinion, it was a waste of time interviewing with him because he knows nothing about the pharmacy profession. He asked me questions that were geared for other positions and I remember he was trying to choose which questions to read off and ask me. \r\n\r\nThus, in spite of the fact that he was friendly, I knew he didn't have a clue about my profession. I don't know about how much the interview process has changed. However, I do know that I would never want to work for NYP. I work as a pharmacist now and at Montefiore the interview process is much better. I was called directly by the pharmacy director and then had an interview with her and the panel of pharmacy managers. They are directly related to my field and know which questions to ask and understand the profession well. \r\n\r\nI believe NYP should have better HR staff that know more about the position people are applying for. Also, I think NYP is very much all about GPA's and value higher GPA's in candidates.

Most questions were related to my daily responsibilities. They asked whether I am familiar with tube feedings and TPN. Also asked to see a portfolio. Truthfully I thought they did not seem as interested as I thought they would be. I did not think it was hard; you just have to be prepared to discuss your work experience in details. \r\n\r\nThen a week later the clinical supervisor contacted me to say they decided to not go further with the process because they want a candidate with experience, flexibility and who demonstrates leadership characteristics. Also someone who is proactive. \r\n\r\nI was fairly disappointed. The listed posting asked for 6 months of experience. I have close to 2 years of work experience and a Master's Degree. Also mentioned I should go for more certifications but I felt that was not fair because I have only became an RD for only 2 years and just recently finished my Master's. \r\n\r\nI wish they were more specific with what qualifications they are looking for on their job postings.

The interviewers (there were two) spent the first part of the interview picking at my resume. I took that in stride, because I saw it as free-of-charge feedback, and who doesn't want that? They spent the rest of it asking questions with a tone that suggested that I really should beg for inclusion at this \"number one\" institution (they made sure to throw that in a few times, too).  I am entry-level for the job I interviewed for, but I am NOT entry level professionally. I expected to have to explain my transition, but....goodness. I'm sorry I felt the need to go in a different direction people!\r\nI asked questions at the end about the interviewers (because I had looked them up prior) to see how they got where they had gotten and where they saw the position and the specific field going. I was not impressed with their answers. They stated that the next step would be to come in person, but they didn't say whether it would be a one on one plan, or a panel. I didn't ask.\r\nI got off the phone with mixed feelings and a feeling this wasn't going to work out, though I was still a little optimistic. To be honest, I felt a little disrespected and picked apart. To add insult to injury, it took them ONE MONTH to publicly state (because I am sure they decided quickly) that I didn't get the job, and then they didn't even have the courtesy to send a direct \"thanks but no thanks\" email (and yes, I think those are good, because SOMEONE sent that). Rather, I had to make it a point to login to my account and see what the updated status was -- THAT is how I confirmed I was out (I mentioned the one month, correct?). I had applied for a different position way after interviewing for this one -- I applied for this new one in April --  and miraculously, they knew just a few days afterwards that they didn't want me for that either. That's fine. I don't expect to get every job I apply for. I just expected far more...everything from NYP. No.  I'm not at all impressed with this \"number one\" hospital, and how I was treated.
