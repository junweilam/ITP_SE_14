Describing past roles, how you would handle situations and how you go about your job.\r\n\r\nThe interview with the director started out well, stating he wanted to get to know me as person and as a whole individual. Where questions started out with my education, career decisions and directions to where I am now. This is where the interview went south. The mood turned into more of a hostile interrogation. The director intensely and aggressively asked questions about my past employers and their internals processes, structures, policies and business practices as he took detailed notes. I answered his questions to start, but as his follow up questions became more and more detailed about specific process and structures, I knew I was brought in to be questioned on my past employers. From then, I fed him embellished details for the heck for it.\r\n\r\nThe next part he asked questions on how I did my job and tools or sources I used. When he was not satisfied with the answer with he would follow up saying that I could think harder or that I was holding back. Again, very aggressively hostile nature taking very detailed notes. The last part he asked questions on was my salary history and specific names of people I have reported to in past jobs. Same deal hostile nature, when refusing to answer on some, he would continue to pry and not take no for an answer.\r\n\r\nLooking back on this I should have excused myself from the interview when he started asking for specific details about my past employers. I think what got me was how the interview started.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the interview, he told me that he didn't think I would fit the department. The competitor in me, had to give a snippy response on why he is wrong.

I arrived 15 minutes early and due to the long drive there, requested if I could use the restroom. The receptionist asked me if I actually really needed to go then conceded to try to scan me up to another floor. The elevator never opened so I went back to reception to try to get them to scan me back in. Instead of doing so, they simply informed me that \"it takes awhile\" and I was turned away. After about 7 minutes I returned to reception and I was then questioned on how badly I needed to use the restroom (at this point, it was pretty badly). They scanned me back and I ran up to use the restroom. Reception failed to alert the team that I was there 15 minutes early. Also, once I was finally taken to the interview conference room, the first interviewer WAS AN HOUR LATE. The individual then asked me how I was compensated at a previous position. I answered truthfully to which this hiring manager retorted with \"I KNOW they DO NOT pay that much.\" (which actually isn't much at all). Then the hiring manager proceeded to question me on the compensation and then go on a tangent about how competitive the team is. While the hiring manager was asking questions and I was responding, there was a lot of texting going on. I was then taken to a person of a higher level. To sum it up, this director level individual declared how they could go \"anywhere else\" and make xxx more money but they don't simply because of the mission. Overall, from just that experience alone, I can gather that it is likely an uncomfortable culture with leadership that has a sizable chip on their shoulders. It was a complete waste of my time since I had to take some time off of my current role to attend the interview. Also, no \"thank you for your time but...\" communication.

I was later told I'd speak with her in a 2nd interview if I passed the 1st; I passed.\r\n\r\n2nd interview was panel-type. \r\n\r\nOne panelist asked me an odd \"gotcha\" question, & as I answered in a way that seemed to bug her, she glanced at the exec who 1st interviewed me & gave her a look to convey that I didn't cut it; she'd used the interview to flaunt her smarts.\r\n\r\nMostly, it went well.  Within 2 weeks I heard from the TA rep who'd recruited me; she told me I'm the \"top pick\" & that she'd like to ask me about my job history in order to fill out a \"worksheet\" to determine my pay.  When I asked if I'd gotten the job, if an offer would be made, she stumbled through her response, finally telling me she'd call in a few days.  When I asked for clarification -- i.e., if I'm the \"top pick\" & you're creating an offer worksheet, doesn't this mean I have the job? -- she couldn't answer.  To see if I could get a real answer, I asked if instead of popping the cork on champagne, how 'bout I have a glass of my favorite soda?  She said, \"Sure, & share some with me.\"\r\n\r\nBizarre; if I'm the \"top pick\" & an offer worksheet is underway, then why can't the rep give me an answer re am I to be HIRED?  BAD conduct by the rep.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard back from the rep, she said: \"I have bad news for you -- the job's gone to someone else.\"  Shocked, I asked what became of my \"top pick\" status; she stammered.  Finally, she said she'd \u201cnever\u201d tell a candidate he was the \"top pick,\" that she'd told me I'm in the \"top 3.\"  She'd LIED to cover-up her misconduct; I told her I\u2019m filing a grievance against her.\r\n\r\nI then contacted her sup again & asked her where to send my grievance.  The sup told me she'd like a honcho in TA to call me.  I gave her my number & set a time for him to call. The call was brief; I just wanted to know where to send my grievance; he replied that I should send it to him.\r\n\r\nI wrote a detailed grievance against the rep serving under him, including dates/ times & copies of all relevant emails.\r\n\r\nHere's the reply from the TA honcho:\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Mr. ___\r\n\r\nThank you for providing us with feedback about your experience with ___during the recruitment process. Your input is appreciated. We regret that your experience did not reflect the level of customer care that we\u2019re committed to and regret any inconvenience.  We wish you all the best in your professional endeavors.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n____\"\r\n\r\nSo, instead of tackling my complaint, this arrogant hack had the gall to attack me, say my customer care skills are sub-par.  My customer care skills were never questioned in either interview, as it is self-evident from my resume, references & many awards that my \"customer care\" skills are top notch and, in one instance, contributed greatly to the saving of a member's life.\r\n\r\nAppalled by L.A. Care's hiring process, I escalated my complaint to a honcho in HR.  I added the honcho from TA to the complaint & cc'ed the CEO.  An employee representing the CEO wrote back, telling me the CEO ordered the HR honcho to look into my complaint against the TA rep & her boss.\r\n\r\nI heard back from the HR honcho; his response was no better than any prior response, DESPITE THE FACT the CEO had ordered the HR honcho to handle the matter properly.  Here\u2019s the HR honcho's \"response\" to my complaint:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. ___, \r\n\r\nYou have previously received a correspondence from us regarding this matter.  We will not be taking any further action nor respond to any further communication from you on this matter.\r\n \r\n ___\"\r\n\r\nMy complaint was blown off by yet another imperious stooge, DESPITE THE FACT that the CEO had told him to treat the matter properly.\r\n\r\nThis is UNACCEPTABLE. \r\n\r\nSo, I put together an e-mail containing all the correspondence between me & the employees of L.A. Care with whom I'd interacted & forwarded it to the L.A. Care Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, I got a certified letter from a lawyer in L.A. Care's legal dept., a cease & desist  letter, demanding that I no longer contact anyone at L.A. Care or face legal action.  Incredibly, the letter stated, in part: \r\n\r\n\"You applied for a job at L.A. Care and the job offer was made to another individual .... It appears that you are displeased with this result and have made a number of inappropriate communications to various L.A. Care staff, despite L.A.
