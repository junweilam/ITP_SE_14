My offer to complete a new screening same-day to alleviate \u201csuspicion\u201d was still rejected. I was then informed that this was due to a Children\u2019s Hospital policy that was not outlined in the onboarding information nor expressed verbally to me at any time.

Outreach attempts to my prospective manager were also ignored even though I had been told to reach out with questions or concerns. I am still pretty dumbfounded by this entire situation.
