The nurses were very unfriendly to me. The next morning I called to inform the manager that I had done the peer interview and to thank her again for the opportunity to interview. I ask if she wanted me to meet with her at anytime and she said no. She told me that there were a couple more applicants to interview and that she would be in touch by the first of the next week to let me know either way.

I remember now. I've been meaning to call you.
