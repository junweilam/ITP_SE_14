It should have been a huge red flag to me from the beginning when they couldn't commit to communicating with me when they said they would and would constantly push things back. I wasted about 3 weeks of my job search waiting for this company to follow through. \n\nI immediately found it strange when they didn't start off the interview asking me a single question to get to know me, but rather, the entire interview was just a number of people reading from a list of questions. No introduction, no overview of the position, no explanation of the role either, just nothing. They jumped straight into the questions and rushed through all the questions. There was no attempt whatsoever to get to know me, no attempt to make me feel comfortable, and there was zero conversation except for when they gave me the chance to ask questions at the end. I felt completely disrespected and felt like my time had been wasted by the end of it. Interviews are supposed to feel like a conversation, not an interrogation. Strange that they apparently don't care about what a potential member of their team is going to be like as a person? That gives off the impression that they're more interested in filling the position with just anybody who qualifies and can do the job instead of someone who they feel would genuinely fit in with their company. Is that a place that I would want to work for? Absolutely not. The people who interviewed me either have no idea what it takes to conduct an interview or just cared more about filling the position with the \"perfect\" candidate than honestly trying to get to know each interviewee and what they personally have to offer. It is seriously concerning for a company to specialize in social work and care more about what their workers can do than they do about the character of their workers. \n\nI read a lot of reviews from others who has worked for this company and the general theme seemed to be that they do not care about the wellbeing of their workers. I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and showed up to the interview anyway but I can now see clearly why people have had such bad experiences working for this place. If they can't even be bothered to get to know you during the interview, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they won't bother to get to know you or care about you as a member of their company either. This kind of attitude is unacceptable in a field that experiences high rates of burnout. A company who cares for their employees is integral. They also made some strange comments while they were explaining their billable hours that made it pretty obvious that they only care about the money. \n\nSave your time and efforts and work elsewhere with a good company culture!", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about a time you dealt with a stressful situation"}, {"date": "26 Jun 2020", "title": "Clinical Case Manager II Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Caminar", "Interview Descriptions": "Much more intense than I expected, and off-putting in some ways.

People in the office and the interviewer were very nice and welcoming. The interviewer mentioned multiple times her frustration with the Caminar HR team and how quick they were to reject candidates and how she'd lost a lot of people she wanted to hire. After a great in person,  i was offered the position pending cleared background checks and a physical. I was concerned about being denied the position due to a medication  I am on that could show up on the panel. I was told to tell my concerns to a personal assistant which I refused to do. I understand HIPPA laws and was not about to talk about protected medical items with a secretary. When I finally got the phone number for the HR Generalist (not an email since I bet they didn't want a paper trail)I called and she clearly was not educated very much in Human Resources. She also didn't understand when  talked about HIPPA or GINA. But since she was all I had, I talked to her about the medication and she said it shouldn't be a problem and I would still have the job. So having disclosed everything, I went to the physical. The physical itself was intensive and may have injured me as I was told to repeatedly lift in 5 lb increments up to 50lbs. It wasn't just lifting but it was squats with the weight and I'm not sure that my interviewer could have done this. My chiropractor said that I have injuries from this and the medical staff said they have NEVER done such an extensive physical. I made sure that the practitioners noted my  medications multiple times so imagine my surprise when I was denied the position based solely on the panel. It was so much work for a low low paying job and the whole process took about a month. I would think that a company who places people in jobs who are on medication would not discriminate against an applicant due to medical information received. Maybe my interviewer was right. Maybe they need a new HR team so that down the line they are not sued for discrimination. I'm not pursuing this avenue since I now have no interest whatsoever in working there", "Interview Questions": "Very very basic. \r\nWhy are you interested in position, etc"}, {"date": "16 Nov 2014", "title": "Case Manager Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1+ week.\u00a0I interviewed at Caminar", "Interview Descriptions": "Submitted resume and cover letter via email through a listing found online.
