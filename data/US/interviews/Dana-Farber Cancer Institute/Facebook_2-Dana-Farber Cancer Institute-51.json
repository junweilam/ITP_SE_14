While I have always been enthusiastic about contributing to research and working with this company, my experience was negative. After submitting my application, it took approximately a month to receive a response for an interview, which I understood and remained excited about. However, during the interview at the Brockton, Massachusetts location, the interviewer displayed extreme rudeness, rushed through my responses, and asked an inappropriate question. Unfortunately, this led me to decide not to proceed with the interview. I acknowledge that this isolated incident does not reflect the company as a whole, as I still believe it is a great organization to work for. However, I believe it is important to share my experience to potentially benefit other applicants. Throughout my career, I have undergone numerous interviews and have never encountered anything negative or felt compelled to leave a negative review. However, in this particular case, I felt compelled to share my experience. I am uncertain whether I was a victim of discrimination, if the interviewer was having a difficult day, or what exactly led to this encounter.

It was for a research assistant I position in a small lab, so an entry level job for someone newly out of college or looking for experience. As someone who was newly out of college and really struggling to find jobs in the health world in Boston, the process really further discouraged me. At first it took about a month to receive any follow up from my application, which at that point I just assumed it had been a rejection since no reply seemed to be the norm for RA jobs here and at other hospitals I've applied to, so I was really excited to hear back at all. We scheduled for a short 15 minute informational call, which after I was feeling even more excited about the job, hearing more information about what exactly the lab was studying (the original positing didn't have much info about the specific studies and research -just general psycho social research on cancer outcomes and treatment experience). This phone call was with the current RA in the lab and went well, but she was also honest that  they had a lot of applications so I still wasn't expecting much (but felt the role would be perfect for me and thought the phone call went great). I followed up with a long email explaining more of my qualifications and interest and got a response about a week later that I would move onto the next round, this time a zoom interview with the current RA and the doctor in charge of the lab. Again, I thought the interview went great and was really excited, but still didn't get my hopes up too much as I knew there were a lot of applicants. The interview was nothing out of the ordinary with standard questions about my interest and experience and how I prioritize work, communication styles, etc. Both the doctor and RA were very nice and engaging and I was hopeful and excited after the interview. The RA told me that they would be in touch in a \"few weeks\" and that they would let me know definitely one way or another and lamented how she knew it was really frustrating being ghosted by employers, which was nice to hear. I sent another follow up email soon after to thank them for their time and recap the conversation etc. I quickly received a positive email back from the RA saying they enjoyed speaking to me, thanks for the note, and the would be in touch. About two days later I received an email from DF HR about references. This is where I feel the interview/hiring process became a little ridiculous and unfair to applicants. They asked me to provide 5 professional references for a \"short\" survey within 24 hours. This email was sent on a Friday afternoon... making 24 hours especially difficult. 5 references is a lot, I think 3 is usually standard and this is for an ENTRY level job straight out of college. I have not even had 5 bosses and didn't have 5 people at the drop of a hat to ask to fill out what DF referred to as a short survey. So, as I was really excited about this job, I was frantically emailing and texting old bosses, coworkers, and professors to ensure they would be willing to fill out this survey. Once I had 5 sure references, I put them into the system for them to receive the survey as an email. This took me about 36 hours (email originally said to please provide in 24 hours, but since the email was sent late afternoon on a Friday, I thought they might be more lenient about the 24 hour window, but I did receive a reminder email 24 hours stating that I had failed to provide the references and to please  do it ASAP). So after finding these 5 references and giving them all the instructions about what email they would receive and how to fill out the survey (which I had originally told them would be a SHORT survey because that is what the email told me - come to find out it was actually about a 25 question survey asking to rate me on a variety of topics and skills, with room for comments - which in my opinion is not what I would call a short survey and is not really the professional norm for what would be expected of references.) At this point, I'm frustrated, but also really excited because I thought if they needed my references this quickly, it meant I was most likely a final candidate and was really excitedly waiting for next steps. Well, I was wrong because after this DF ghosted me for a full month until I finally sent a follow up email to  restate my interest and ask if they were still in the hiring process or had concluded. I received a short email about 3 days later confirming they had hired someone. After I had scrambled to find references and had them fill out a long detailed survey, I was ghosted and rejected. Makes me embarrassed to reach out to references again for other jobs as it is clear I was rejected from this job and they already generously gave me their time on this long, detailed survey, putting me and them in an awkward position and making my further job search even more difficult.", "Interview Questions": "How do you delegate your time when facing multiple important tasks and projects? \nWhat is your interest and experience in this kind of work?\n"}, {"date": "25 Feb 2022", "title": "Intern - Hourly Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute", "Interview Descriptions": "Over the phone.

I first met with a recruitment coordinator who did an initial phone screen with me.   I then interviewed a week later with the clinical scheduling manager.  Both interviews were very pleasant and went well, although they were quite lengthy and the exact same questions were asked. The clinical scheduling manager quickly followed up the next day with me to schedule a third interview with two other clinical scheduling specialists with whom I would work. The two clinical scheduling specialists were not as friendly and seemed either uninterested or unprepared for my interview. Still, the third interview went alright. Followed up with the clinical scheduling manager to discuss next steps and never heard back. For a prestigious institution such as Dana Farber, not even bothering to send a reply email or following up with a phone call is the height of unprofessionalism and rudeness. Three lengthy interviews is a substantial block of time and misleading for potential job seekers. I would not recommend the interview process to others\u2014it took about three months to finish the application and interview process only to not even receive an email saying that I was not moving forward to the next steps in the hiring process.", "Interview Questions": "Q: What are your strengths and weaknesses?\r\nQ: Tell me about why you think you would be a good fit for this position."}, {"date": "3 Aug 2021", "title": "Administrative Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute", "Interview Descriptions": "Everyone was very nice and professional.
