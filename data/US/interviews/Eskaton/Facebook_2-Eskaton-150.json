I was called a few days later and offered the position.  However, I declined because it was not a good fit for me.  Also, I would be remiss if I did mention that this was the second job I applied for at Eskaton.  The first time I applied was for the same position at a different location.  I was not invited to interview.  In lieu of not responding to my application at all or simply sending me a standard notification email, I received a form postcard informing me that another candidate was selected for the position. While I think sending a decision in the mail still has merits in the 21st century, despite being somewhat old fashioned, a postcard is tacky and distasteful because it does not protect candidate confidentiality.  Anyone who handled the postcard prior to its delivery was privy to the information.  Occasionally, I receive a neighbor\u2019s mail by accident, and vice versa.  I would have been extremely embarrassed if one of my neighbors had received this postcard.  I recommend that Eskaton stop sending these form, impersonal postcards immediately.  Instead, I recommend that the company either send a letter in a confidential envelop or just send an email like most other employers.  Even not responding to a candidate that took the time to apply for an open position would be better than a postcard.", "Interview Questions": "What led you to apply for this position?
