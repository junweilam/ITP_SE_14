I applied for the job in December 2017. I didn\u2019t hear anything back. They reposted the position in February 2018 and I applied again. I received a telephone call inviting me to a telephone interview in April 2018. The telephone interview was with a panel of Counselors who work in the office. Very straight forward, basic questions. I received a call back about 1 week later inviting me in for an ALL DAY interview. Now I know this is academia but an all day interview for a Counseling position seems a little obnoxious. I was advised that the interview involved a presentation & was given 3 weeks to prepare, which I thought was fair. The interview was indeed all day, starting at 9:00am and ending at 3:00pm. It involved a panel interview,  a case conceptualization, a 1:1 lunch/interview with the assistant director, a presentation and interviews with members of the front office staff. Now, all of this was a bit much but the team was inviting and pleasant throughout the day. The worst part of the interview process was the lack of communication after the interview. I was advised I would hear something back within several weeks as they would be interviewing candidates over that time. After about 8 weeks without hearing anything, I called and spoke with the Director who advised me that they were still interviewing. At that point, I knew I would not be offered the position. I looked online and saw that 1 person had already been hired. I emailed the Assistant Director a few weeks later and received no reply. Finally after 6+ months I received a \u201csorry you weren\u2019t selected\u201d email! This is totally unprofessional for a University of this magnitude. It is absurd to have candidates prepare several weeks for an all day interview, and then not have the professional decency to let them know they weren\u2019t selected within a respectable timeframe. \r\n\r\nI must say though, I\u2019m sure I dodged a bullet because an employer who behaves like this pre-hire most likely behaves even worst post-hire.
