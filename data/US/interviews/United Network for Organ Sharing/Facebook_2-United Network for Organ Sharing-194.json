They called back and asked if I would like to come in for an interview and if I was willing to make less. I agreed to it but did not commit to the salary amount. Initially, I was to be interviewed by two people; the number increased on my arrival. Each person had a list of questions to ask, and they took turns. I asked many questions and came to the realization they are not well versed in the Instructional System Design field. Their approach is antiquated and lacked clear vision on how to create unified eLearning courses. They expressed concern about the lack of creativity in their work and how it is not received well by their targeted audience. I said I would need to evaluate the material before I can give them any suggestion. They agreed, and I was pointed to location on their website to review some documents. Next day, I sent a thank you letter and took a single frame to suggest possible changes by placing a before and an after example. That was not received well. The following day, I received we are not an interesting letter and was told that I lied on my resume regarding having experience in specific software. During the interview process, I stated the name of the application I was using and that I have experience in their preferred app.  Apparently, that information fell on deaf ears. They concluded the letter by saying I should think about this before I continue searching for work.\r\nThis group lacked tact and professionalism. I can understand if they are not interested, but to flatly lie so they can feel better about themselves, shows there insecurities. \r\nMy opinion of this company and the amateurs who work in the Instructional Innovation group;  stop living inside of a bubble, remove the silos within your group and move into the 21st century. Their learning materials are below average at best.

After three days I received a final round interview offer and so I flew to Richmond a few days later. I was told there would be a panel interview and a management interview. Much to my surprise, I had a panel interview, a management interview, as well as a technical interview, and a senior leadership interview. \r\n\r\nAll went great except for the technical interview which was a bit awkward as the main interviewer was via Skype and it was requested I write SAS code on a whiteboard.
