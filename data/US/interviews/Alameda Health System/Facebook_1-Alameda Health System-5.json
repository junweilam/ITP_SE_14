      "Interview Questions": "General questions were asked in terms of what I have done, and what I want to do in the future etc. Surprisingly no technical questions were asked which was shocking. only thing I was asked is whether I know MFA, which is multi factor authentications. I was so shocked that, somebody asked only this question in a technical scenario."
