Management was very poor with explaining their end of things, answering questions, and justifying decisions. More than anything, they contacted several references BEFORE the final interview (nonetheless a job offer, which they didn't ultimately make).\r\n- I'll note that all staff I'd talked with at that time seems to have left since then as well", "Interview Questions": "What's the first thing that comes to mind when I say the word:\r\nOne example, \"funny\".  Not all were that bad."}], []]
