Went to job fair and interviewed for talent acquisition specialist and release of information clerk. I recommend going ahead and applying before you go to the job fair because if not, they don\u2019t have your prior experience to look at and they may not seriously consider you. I did get a second interview for both positions with the hiring manager though. I also interviewed for multiple scribe positions and for unit secretary and I had another scheduled for precertification specialist on Monday. The interviews were all extremely long and in depth. They asked questions about why you want to work for PMC, to tell about something that can\u2019t be determined from your application, to tell about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it, etc. They all asked the same questions. There were a couple that didn\u2019t go as long as the rest so I guess maybe they weren\u2019t that interested. Idk.
