She was very friendly and immediately invited me to a second interview. I didn't live in the area that I applied to, so they were nice enough to interview me via zoom rather than in person. The second interview was with two employees who were not in the programs department. They were about 15 minutes late, claiming that they didn't realize that they were using zoom. This didn't bother me at first, but after reflection, it was a bad sign. The interview was standard with general experience questions and \"tell me about a time...\" questions. The interviewers were professional but didn't seem interested in connecting with me. I specifically asked about the next steps and was told that I would hear back- whether yes or no- the next week. I never heard back, so I reached out the following week. I still haven't heard back. I am shocked that after being explicitly told I would hear back no matter what that they couldn't send me a canned email saying that they wouldn't be moving forward with me. I have been ghosted before with applications, but never after two interviews!

Then a beach ball with questions like \"What's your favorite restaurant\" is thrown to you. \r\n\r\nThe second interview is in a conference room with 4-5 interviewers asking you questions about your previous work experience.
