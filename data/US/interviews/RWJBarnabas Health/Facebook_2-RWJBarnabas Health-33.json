My interview was scheduled for 10:00 am. I arrived at 09:50 and let the front desk HR employee know I was here. By 10:20, nobody came. I went up to the desk and asked if the person interviewing me was running late, the employee at the front desk stated the interviewer was just here and left for another meeting, but will be returning shortly. I let them know again that my interview was for 10:00, and I have been waiting for 30 minutes. I sat back down again. Finally, at 11:00, I went up to the desk and said that I will be leaving and I would not like to reschedule it. The employee at the front desk said \"Okay! Take care.\" After I left, it took me 20 minutes to exit from their parking garage for visitors. HR at Newark Beth Israel does not validate parking tickets- they make job applicants pay the $5 parking fee.  The parking garage does not staff the downstairs security booth, and both of the exits were not letting me out. I called the hospital operator, who transferred me to security. Security told me someone would come to the parking garage to let me out. Nobody came. Luckily, a woman who was driving behind me told me how to get around the parking issue and I was able to exit.
