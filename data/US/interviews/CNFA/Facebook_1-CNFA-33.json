The panel was comprised of two division leads for the programming departments and then the hiring manager - the senior agribusiness advisor. The two department leads were a joy to talk to, ask situational questions. The hiring manager was extremely negative and I could tell would be a bad manager, he corrected me during the interview itself.

I had a one hour interview by phone with this recruiting firm. Then I was asked to complete an in-depth test which I spent approximately six hours on. Next I was invited for an in-person interview with HR, the hiring manager and another member of the BD team. This lasted about one hour. I was told that they needed someone to start asap and that I would hear an update in two weeks or less. After a month passed, I called to ask for an update and was told that the HR rep I met with was on maternity leave and that they would let me know that day about my status. I have heard no update. This process was arduous and opaque. It feels like I just wasted more than 8 hours (one full work day). If this is how they treat a candidate for a job, I can only imagine how they must treat their employees. My advice is to not waste your time and talents on CNFA.", "Interview Questions": "When I was asked how soon I could start they balked at my answer and tried to get me to say I could start sooner.
