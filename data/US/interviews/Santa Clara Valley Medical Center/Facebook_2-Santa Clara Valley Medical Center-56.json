The results become available after about 1 month.  Keep in mind that this hospital is actively recruiting for extra help positions. Next, depending on how you scored on the exam, you are ranked in order to have your information submitted to various openings throughout the hospital system. Some required a telephone screening prior to an in-person interview. I attended various interviewa for a full-time LVN position here. One in particular stood out. For one opening, I specifically asked the recruiter if it was an extra help or coded position. The rep confirmed prior to interview that it was a full-time, coded position. Upon beginning the interview, one of the hiring managers begins to explain that there is a need for an on-call \"extra-help\" employee. I immediately paused to confirm if this was the correct position or not. \r\n\r\nThe point of this is that to proceed with caution with VMC, as the recruiting staff will make you jump through various hoops in order to qualify for an interview, only to be conned into interviewing for a temporary, extra-help position. If you decide to interview for this company, please be advised to ask for full disclosure of the job position prior to attending, in order to set expectations realistically. Objective appears to utilize LVNS to do the heavy lifting of nursing tasks, while allowing the RNs to sit back and relax from behind the scenes. \r\n\r\nThis company is not one I would seriously pursue once my RN in completed, as there are more valuable hospital structures in the immediate area that know how to identify a qualified employee and compensate him/her accordingly.

The first time, I made it past the phone interview and went on to the in person panel interview. Although I didn't get the job, the interview experience was pleasant and when I got the rejection letter for not getting the position, I made sure to send a thank you letter to the Director, thanking them for the time and consideration. \r\n\r\nThe second and most recent time was a little different. I had a phone interview and it was pretty standard questions and I felt confident in my answers and explanation of my background. However the interviewer, although pleasant, mentioned two things that took me back and I wasn't sure how to respond. First, she made it clear to me, in my opinion, that they were specifically looking for a woman to hold one or all of the open positions(the interview was for 3 open positions). I'm not opposed to that at all but if that's the case, why would I be interviewed other than to just go through the motions? It felt like I was just a number on a list that they had to contact in order to get who they really wanted. I understand this is a common practice in recruiting I just didn't know how to respond. \r\n\r\nThe second thing that bothered me was the questions about my military experience. I typically try to down play my military experience on my resume and elsewhere because I understand that a lot of employers either don't understand the job or don't want veterans in the organization, especially here in the Bay area. However, I can't completely take it off my resume because no matter how much I try to down play it, it still takes up a  significant portion of my work history.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview, I don't remember the exact wording of the question but the interviewer asked something similar to \"The military experience is good but how does that help us?\" I can't remember exactly what else was asked but I remember fumbling around  my answers after that because I felt like I was being told that my military service wasn't good enough. Prior to this, I thought I had done a good job explaining the value I could bring and how my experience related to the position but I'm not sure if it was enough.\r\n\r\nAfter the phone interview, I felt pretty confident that I wouldn't be called back to move forward. I don't fault the interviewer necessarily but want any other veteran that applies to a similar position to be very careful about how they word and explain their service. In my humble experience, a lot of employers, including the county, aren't very military friendly and a lot of times we have to go above and beyond to prove our worth.  \r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, SCVMC is a good organization to work for but like others, it's difficult to get past the screening process with a military background.", "Interview Questions": "How does your military service help us?"}, {"date": "11 Oct 2018", "title": "Clinical Nurse Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (San Jose, CA) in Sept 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "Applied the job from county website and it took about 2 weeks to receive a response email to notify your qualifications ranking for this position.
