I went back to SD and started my endless waiting. a week later, I heard nothing from them, so I emailed their recruiter(who contacted before) for inquiring the result, she didn't response. A couple of days later, I called her, she didn't pickup, so I left a message on the answering machine, NO ONE ever called me back.
