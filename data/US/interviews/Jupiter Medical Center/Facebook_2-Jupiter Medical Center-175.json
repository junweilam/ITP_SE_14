The interviewer didn't even bother showing up and I found they sent me the wrong \"zoom\" link to the interview. So they wasted my time and effort. The second time I interviewed I was rushed through the interview after I disclosed that I had another job offer but was excited to interview with Jupiter since I heard great things about them. I heard from a reliable source that they basically blacklisted me and accused me of being \"Very rude\" to them which was a lie. I believe it was because I disclosed I had another job but I wanted to see what Jupiter was offering (pay, patient-to-nurse ratio, and benefit-wise) but the director/recruiter for Jupiter took that as being \"rude\" how unbelievable. Honestly, if you value your time don't bother with them.
