Our first call went great and we seemed to be on the same page with what we were both looking for. \n\nI was told I\u2019d be scheduled for a second interview with the recruiting team\u2019s manager. This call was scheduled a few days later and was conducted via phone call. It was scheduled for an hour during my work day but wasn\u2019t a problem as I was able to move some things around to accommodate. Again, our conversation was enjoyable and seemed to line up well with the direction of the company.\n\nThe final interview was a week later with the recruiting manager and some tenured recruiters via video interview. This one was a bit harder to accommodate due to the fact that it was for 90 mins during the middle of the day. However, I came up with an excuse for my current employer and was able to take the interview. Once again, we all seemed to be in sync with our answers to each other\u2019s questions. I was told at the end of the interview that other people were still being entertained and that a final answer would be given to me by mid week the following week.\n\nThroughout the entire process, I would say that it was a positive experience. What changed this to a negative experience is that they did not follow through with what they had told me. I was not contacted midweek the following week. I decided to send an email to the recruiting manager thanking them and their team while also asking about next steps. After not receiving a response, on Friday, I decided to send an email to the director and to the hiring manager to try and spark some kind of conversation. Again, no response from either the director or the recruiting manager.\n\nI completely understand that I may not have been what they were looking for exactly.

The hiring manager, who was meant to attend this interview, failed to show up.  This entire interview was extremely awkward- hardly any of the team members asked me questions, as if they did not know how to handle an interview. I decided to take the reins and ask most of the questions. \r\n\r\nAfter this group panel interview, I was selected to proceed to the next round and speak with a local hospital's president.  This was the most positive part of the MultiCare interview process.  He was professional, asked great questions, and expressed enthusiasm over my qualifications and skills for the position.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks passed and I had not received any communications from the hiring manager. I reached out to his admin, asking for an update, and she responded with, \"We are moving in a different direction. Thank you.\"  I expected that the hiring manager would have the decency to communicate directly with me and explain that I was not selected for the position and why. I did make it through all 3 interview rounds, and should have been spoken with directly about MultiCare's decision to move in a different direction. Again, completely unprofessional.

I was an out-of-state candidate, so my experience is not likely typical. \r\n\r\nI spoke for a good amount of time with the recruiter initially. He was knowledgeable and friendly. I was a bit put off, though, as he asked my salary requirement within the first few minutes. I am a manager and understand the need to check salary, however, I felt it was too soon in the process since I had no understanding of the role or the department, and I was told the phone screen would only be 15 to 20 minutes. Because I was an out-of-state candidate, I did not feel comfortable giving a solid salary requirement, as I had not yet researched cost of living in a new state, etc. I gave him a ballpark number and let him know I did not feel comfortable giving a solid number because it was so early in the process. He said, \"I'm just going to put down $XYZ.\" Again, it was early in the process, so I wasn't too concerned (this comes into play later.) \r\n\r\nI then spoke with the woman who would be my supervisor if I got the job. She was great. Smart, obviously passionate, asked great questions, etc. I was very excited about the position as it seemed the perfect role for me, as well as the perfect location for my family. She invited me out to Tacoma to interview.\r\n\r\nThe travel arrangements were a bit rocky and hastily made, but I got there. I flew 8 hours out, stayed overnight, then interviewed all day the next day, then flew home about 10 hours. The interviewers were very thorough, and I was even more interested in the role after speaking to everyone. It seemed like MultiCare was in the middle of a positive culture shift, and I have experience with change management and was very excited to share my ideas. I hoped for the offer and began looking at houses in the area for my family and researching cost of living, etc. \r\n\r\nThe offer came! It was low. It was lower than I indicated to the recruiter from the onset. I researched, talked to friends in the area, as well as to executive recruiters who are in my family. I counter offered. At which point, things got rather unprofessional.\r\n\r\nThe recruiter's tone changed and became very passive aggressive and frankly, a bit unprofessional. All of my research was wrong (only his was correct), despite the fact that I talked to actual people living in the area, researched houses (which made it clear to me the cost of similar housing there would cost me much more than my current location), and spoke with a global executive search firm. The recruiter, \"I'm confused, you said you wanted to relocate and you said this $XYZ was your salary requirement.\" Me, \"Yes, I do want to relocate, but I cannot do so at a detriment to my family. While your data may say the cost of living is similar, I looked at houses, etc., and for the same living standard for my family, I would need to pay quite a bit more.\" \r\n\r\nThey were basically asking me to take a pay cut, a possible loss on my house, etc., to work there, and the recruiter was rather rude in the process. I was uncomfortable that he was not ccing who would be my supervisor on emails, as I wonder if I was misrepresented to her by the recruiter. \r\n\r\nI was very disappointed, as the role was perfect and I really enjoyed all the people I met there.
