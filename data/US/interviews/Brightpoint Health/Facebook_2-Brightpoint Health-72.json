Assured me that I would be doing Group and family therapy. Arranged for an interview at a Site in a borough of NYC other than the one in which I would be working. Interview was unfocused. Next day I get a call from the Out if state recruiter saying I was being offered the job. Really? I didn\u2019t see the site I would be working at, didn\u2019t meet the person who would be my Supervisor and they were offering me the position. I told the recruiter I needed a day to think about it. He told me that was not acceptable, that there were numerous candidates selected for that position and I had to decide by the end of the day. I called later that day declining the offer and the recruiter asked me if I wanted to see the site before I made a decision. Well, Duhh, that is something that any other recruiter would have offered much earlier. I accepted the site visit which was ac10 minute \u201crun through\u201d of a site that looked like a \u201cMedicaid Mill\u201d. Later that day I got a call saying I needed to make a decision. Since I was out of work for a few months and eager to get back to work, I accepted the job due to its location and hours. But I was right... it IS a Medicaid Mill and I should have steered clear of this Agency based on the lack of professionalism shown during the interview process.", "Interview Questions": "How did you learn about Brightpoint?"}, {"date": "19 Apr 2016", "title": "Account Liaison Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Brightpoint Health (New York, NY) in Mar 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "I was called to interview for Bright point health.

I was told that they wanted to hire me and that I had to wait for internal approval and that someone from HR would be contacting me. I waited an additional three week to hear from someone and was told that they are not going to hire for that position any longer and that there were layoffs through out the company.
