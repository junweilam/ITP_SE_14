They seemed to want detailed,  well thought out examples of some past work experience.  \n\nThe staff I interviewed with were all kind and respectful. \n\nThe questions and vibe are pretty obvious for a patient service role.

All of whom you have to hope and pray that they are willing to complete it and email it back via the email link sent by health Source.   This is something the applicant has absolutely no control over but this will prevent you from being hired if they don't complete it.
