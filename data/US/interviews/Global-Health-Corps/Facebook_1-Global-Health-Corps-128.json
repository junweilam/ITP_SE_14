Many of the questions were standard - ie tell me about yourself, about your work history/experiences ,your motivation for applying to GHC. There were also two case questions: one about how you would scale up a public health program and one about what to do if you arrived at your placement and no one knew what to do with you/you had no supervisor. I provided a short answer for the second one and they probed me for more information.  I was offered a finalist interview which I did in person with one person at the organization and we were also joined by several others on the study team in various locations on the phone.
