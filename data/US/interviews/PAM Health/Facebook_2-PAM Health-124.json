Was told that my application was specifically (the only) one selected by the hiring manager...she told me I should be excited when I sounded shocked. The interview was first issued by the hiring manager. The interview went well until she told me that I was competing against someone else that was really good and it would be a difficult decision, and to come back the following week.

Everyone went explicitly into what THEY did, no real questions for me pertaining to my skill set, with the exception of one person who asked me what my first 90 days would look like as well as how I would design out a training. After speaking to them all, I was a bit foggy on what exactly the job would entail, besides maybe a glorified trainer... not \"organizational effectiveness\" type of duties were heard, but told that would be the vision eventually. \r\nThe owner of the company was great and actually ASKED ME about my Ph.D. which was a \"preferred\" requirement for the position.

She AGAIN said... it would be a difficult decision (which to me, is a way of saying you're not the one), and then proceeded to say.. well I am blessed to have two great people interview so I can't lose. Very odd. I left with uncertainty and not very excited about the position due to the feeling of wasted time and energy with the decision already really being made. The company seemed like a great place to be, but the odd feeling was a bit contradictory to the excitement of the thumbs up and then the..\" well the other person is realllly good and on point etc.\"  Very inappropriate to compare how awesome (or not) other candidates are with your interviewee.
