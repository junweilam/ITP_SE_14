As a result, there is no consistency in the questions you will be asked or the situations you will be in. In its most general sense, the committee will review all of the candidate's packets given to the committee from HR. The packets are scored. Do yourself a favor by CLEARLY addressing in your cover letter how you meet each of the stated minimum and preferred qualifications. The clearer you are for the committee members, the better. Ignore a page limit - this is academia not business. \r\n\r\nThe process then consists, generally, of a telephone/Skype interview followed by a campus visit for the last 2-3 candidates. Your offer will come after that if you are selected. There is not a lot of negotiation space for salary, but there is some; take advantage of this opportunity to negotiate your salary. EWU does not give raises for merit so beyond COLA raises, your salary is static.\r\n\r\nFinally, understand that EWU's HR department has no incentive to move quickly and they live up to that expectation. Add in the reality that it is a state bureaucracy that encourages mediocrity and you have a pretty good feel for the time frame you can expect. It is not unreasonable to expect the process to take up to 6 months. 90 days is considered \"Fast Track\", and less than that is reserved for the President's pet projects.
