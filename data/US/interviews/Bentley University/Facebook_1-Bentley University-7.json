I came to campus about two weeks later and met with two senior staff members. \r\nA few days after that I received a invitation to come to campus a second time for the final round. About  two weeks later I had a final interview with the director, then met with the person who would be my supervisor, followed by a student lead tour, and then a final meeting with HR to discuss salary, starting date, benefits, and timeline for hearing back. \r\n\r\nI was told I would hear back within two weeks, at the very latest, either way. The HR rep was very insistent that I would hear from her, personally, with news on what was happening.\r\nAbout two weeks had passed and I had emailed the HR rep to see if there was any update. After about a week of no response,  I called and left a voice message and I sent one last follow up email which was not returned. A few days later I emailed the woman that would have served as my direct supervisor, as she had given me her business card during the interview and told me to reach out with any questions at all. A week later I heard back from her as she was out of the office traveling for work - she insisted that it should not be much longer, and asked if I was able to \"hold on\", as decisions should be finalized by the end of the week, at the latest.  \r\nThe end of the week came and went with no word from anyone. About a week and a half later, I sent an email to the director, who also gave me her contact information, asking if their was any update on final decisions. She responded almost immediately with a very friendly greeting stating \"That position has already been filled by an alumni, I am so sorry that no one ever informed you of that!\".\r\n\r\nOverall, this was the worst interview experience I have ever had. I have never heard of a finalist not hearing back. It was very challenging having to ask other institutions I was receiving offers from at the same time for more time, to only not ever hear back from Bentley. My issue lies with HR, as I was told I would hear directly from them (all offers come from HR at Bentley), and never heard a word from them after 3 contact attempts.

I came to campus about two weeks later and met with two senior staff members. \r\nA few days after that I received a invitation to come to campus a second time for the final round. About  two weeks later I had a final interview with the director, then met with the person who would be my supervisor, followed by a student lead tour, and then a final meeting with HR to discuss salary, starting date, benefits, and timeline for hearing back. \r\n\r\nI was told I would hear back within two weeks, at the very latest, either way. The HR rep was very insistent that I would hear from her, personally, with news on what was happening.\r\nAbout two weeks had passed and I had emailed the HR rep to see if there was any update. After about a week of no response,  I called and left a voice message and I sent one last follow up email which was not returned. A few days later I emailed the woman that would have served as my direct supervisor, as she had given me her business card during the interview and told me to reach out with any questions at all. A week later I heard back from her as she was out of the office traveling for work - she insisted that it should not be much longer, and asked if I was able to \"hold on\", as decisions should be finalized by the end of the week, at the latest.  \r\nThe end of the week came and went with no word from anyone. About a week and a half later, I sent an email to the director, who also gave me her contact information, asking if their was any update on final decisions. She responded almost immediately with a very friendly greeting stating \"That position has already been filled by an alumni, I am so sorry that no one ever informed you of that!\".\r\n\r\nOverall, this was the worst interview experience I have ever had. I have never heard of a finalist not hearing back. It was very challenging having to ask other institutions I was receiving offers from at the same time for more time, to only not ever hear back from Bentley. My issue lies with HR, as I was told I would hear directly from them (all offers come from HR at Bentley), and never heard a word from them after 3 contact attempts.
