I am being forced to track down information that should have been easy for them to verify and which they are paid to verify and I am not being paid to do.

She then sent a questionnaire survey to my email (to be completed prior to interview; mines was already completed) & scheduled a face to face interview for 2 days later with the manager of the ED department. Upon arrival I was asked to complete a typing test before interviewing with the manager. The face to face interview was just as pleasant. Asked about 10 interview Qs & then it became a little more informal with regular small conversation. Following the interview with the ED manager, she scheduled a peer interview with 2 future co-workers for a week later. The peer interview probably was the most laid back, every interview was seamless, but they both asked about 3 Qs each, explained to me about uniforms and training, asked if I had Qs, then we kinda joked, and and interviewer told me \u201cYou\u2019ll recurve a call from the department manager or your HR recruiter.\u201d, shook my hand, and then smiled & said \u201cSee you soon!\u201d So I kinda thought I had it already.
