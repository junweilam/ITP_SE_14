The job was listed as being fully remote, however he said now they are considering an on-campus requirement once the COVID restriction is lifted in June. He asked me if I would be open to the possibility of relocating if that did become a requirement. I said I was open to relocation in the future, but it was not something my family could do right now.\n\nAbout a month went by since that last conversation and when I heard from him again.

From other reviews, I'm also pretty sure they're a fine place to work. With that said, I was not impressed with how they handled the interview process. I will say a lot of this probably had to do with the COVID-19 pandemic. \r\n\r\nI started the process back in May and it seemed pretty easy at first. There was a short digital based interview through an app that asked pretty standard stuff. After that, they scheduled a video interview with a live person. This gentleman was extremely professional and easy to talk to, and mostly asked questions typical of a standard interview. He also went over what made SNHU a great place to work, and was pretty convincing.\r\n\r\n After this interview, I was instructed to fill out a reference sheet and was told I'd be reached back out to again shortly. Weeks passed and I wasn't told anything, so I figured I'd give the person who's name was in the automated Workday emails a call to ask what was up. She stated that as of right now they were currently not hiring for that position but remained interested in me and would let me know when I could see about next steps. A little weird they still kept up their job postings everywhere if they didn't have openings of these positions, but ok, fine. I wasn't in a big rush to be hired luckily, so I figured I'd wait. \r\n\r\nOver a month passed and I got a little anxious about getting into a new career. I went ahead and emailed the woman who I had called previously and asked if they were perhaps hiring for another one of the roles from their job posting. She told me that they were hiring for a financial aid rep and asked me to review the role description and email her back if I was interested. I emailed her back immediately that I was, but did not hear anything back. I emailed her again a week later, and nothing. By the end of August, I still hadn't heard anything back about either of the roles and had obtained my bachelor's degree in the time I had waited. Even though by this point I was pretty sure she wouldn't reply, I emailed asking if I could switch my application to go for the Academic advisor role. I then got an automated looking email from her stating that I got moved forward and that I needed to schedule an interview with a group of their team. I did so, but was unsure of what role I was even interviewing for at this point. I asked, but got no reply once again.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 plus months of waiting, I finally had this third interview with a group of people that worked for SNHU. The video call was incredibly laggy and I'm not sure if this was due to issues on my end or their's. That said, we were able to get through the interview okay, though they only really had two questions. I asked them firstly what role I was interviewing for, and maybe they didn't like that because the interview that was supposedly going to take like 30 minutes ended rather fast. They asked me basic questions about where I see myself in 5-10 years and why I wanted to work for SNHU. They asked nothing else and told me that I'd get an email \"fairly quickly\" about whether I was being moved forward or not. I got a denial email like a day later.\r\n\r\nOverall, the people from SNHU were pleasant and nice. However, the process seemed EXTREMELY disorganized and communication was not handled well at all. If you're applying for any of their roles right now, I'd say be prepared to possibly be waiting around for a good while.", "Interview Questions": "Where do you see yourself in 5-10 years?\r\nWhy do you want to work for SNHU?\r\nName a time when you dealt with a challenging situation."}, {"date": "25 Aug 2022", "title": "Transfer Credit Evaluator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Southern New Hampshire University in Oct 2020", "Interview Descriptions": "Very easy process overall - I was invited to do a digital/recorded interview, then had an \"in person\" video call interview - both were very concise, and easy to navigate.

On Monday morning, I was contacted for an interview. \r\n\r\nI was sent a fairly inane \"faculty survey\" to fill out (basically a pre-interview sheet) and the link to a survey that would be sent to my references. They want FIVE references, TWO of which must be managers. Did I mention this is for a PART TIME job that pays less than minimum wage when all is said and done?\r\n\r\nI sent back the survey and got in touch with my references on Wednesday. By Thursday, the interviewer was upset that all of my references hadn't gotten to her. Did I mention this is during spring break AND my references had less that 24 hours to respond at this point? Golly, all this pressure on people I admire was really making me want to work for this company! \r\n\r\nThe interview itself was pleasant enough and took about 30 minutes. I was interviewed by the manager of faculty recruitment. The interviewer was VERY happy with my skills and answers and at the end of the interview told me she was sending me a packet that I needed to have it filled out ASAP (notice a trend?) so I could QUICKLY get into the THREE WEEK UNPAID TRAINING that would follow. All of this so I can start teaching ONE class. IN JUNE. It's March as I type this. Yes, I need to work like a house on fire to get SNHU all of my materials so I can sit around and wait for my low-paying job to start three months later. Awesome!\r\n\r\nAt the end of the interview, I asked several questions (How often are classes canceled at the last minute? How active does the instructor need to be when facilitating discussion? How many items is an instructor expected to grade each week?\") and her answers were either \"I don't know, I'll have to get back to you on that.\" or \"That's something you can learn about during the training.\" Then I asked her how many classes an instructor can teach per term. She told me that for the first few terms, I'd be limited to ONE class and that maybe, MAYBE, after several terms, I could teach two at a time but they prefer to keep instructors to one at a time. \r\n\r\nSNHU pays $2200 per course and has six terms each year. That means this position could earn you all of $13,200 for the entire year. Mind you, the college will collect over $200k for your labor and that is a low estimate (6 terms per year, $524 per course hour, each class is 3 course hours, with about 20 students per course (though you may have as many as 28 per class.)) \r\n\r\nThough I passed to the next round (three weeks unpaid training!)
