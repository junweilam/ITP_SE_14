Received an email by the hiring manager about 2 weeks later to set up a phone interview/screening for the follow week. Did well on the phone and was offered an in-person interview the same day by email for the following week. Went to the interview and met with the manager and it went very well. I was told at the end of the interview that they would like me to come back and meet with others in the department soon and that they would contact HR to do reference checks. I barely got out of the parking lot before I got an email from HR for references (a good sign I thought). A few days later I got an email with a schedule to meet the others, which was scheduled about two weeks after my first in-person interview. Went through the second day of interviewing with 4 other people and was told that they would be in contact with me soon. \r\n\r\nWaited for 2 weeks and didn't hear anything so I sent an email to follow up. I was told that a decision had not been made yet and that they would be in contact with me soon. After 4 more weeks I still had not heard anything back and had given up on the position at that point. Its too bad because I had a lot of relevant experience and the ability to help them make much needed changes. The people were really nice during the interviews and I didn't feel like they were trying to trip me up on any questions. They seemed really interested in getting to know me more than just asking standard interview questions, which of course there were a few. I really got the impression that I was going to get the job. I spent $650 in travel expenses and 4 days traveling to and from San Francisco so the least that could have done was email me with a follow up and not left me in limbo for so long. I also wish that if they were not serious about offering me the position that they would have not wasted my reference's time by asking for references before making an offer. I only want to ask my references (all 5 required by UCSF) to spend time on helping me when an offer has been made or is in the works. If this were a high level position I would have understood that practice more so than for this position. \r\n\r\nI have been on a couple interviews with UCSF now and they really like to know what your salary requirements are and don't back down without an answer. I really find this odd but I guess it the norm in California because it has come up in every interview I have been. I don't think this is a question that should be asked during an interview with a company that posts their salary ranges. I wouldn't have applied if I wasn't willing to be paid inside that range. I recommend knowing the salary range offered and don't give your previous salary information. I am strongly against organizations basing your pay off of your previous job. You should be paid for your experience and what you can bring to that position. I recommend knowing the UCSF salary range and making the min-to-midpoint of the UCSF salary range as your salary range.

Responded to a posting on LinkedIn within 2 days of it being posted.  It literally read like my current job description and felt like a completely natural fit.  I was very excited and waited to hear.  And waited and waited and waited.  Finally more than a month later, I got a call from the recruiter to set-up a phone interview.  We set up a phone interview for a few days later but she didn't call until 30 minutes after our scheduled time.  We rescheduled and had the interview.  She read through the bullets of the job description and turned them into questions.  Interesting approach.  At the end, she informed me I was very late in the process and that there were already two people in the reference stage, but she would try to get me in to the Director, but we had to move very fast.  This puzzled me because I had applied, at this point, almost 6 weeks earlier immediately after it was posted on the recruitment site.  But no matter, I told her I would be quickly available for further interviews and would wait to hear from her.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I was thrilled to be moving on in the process!  Many days went by again and I heard nothing.  Finally, I sent an email to ask about the status.  I received a response that an offer had gone to one of the other two I mentioned above and they had accepted.  I was incredibly disappointed and sad that I missed out on such a perfect opportunity.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, I found a old work colleague was working in the same office.  I decided to reach out and see if maybe any other opportunities would be coming up and get the inside track.  I told of my experience and learned some interesting facts about the job I applied for.  Yes, there had been two people considered for the position.  Both were internal candidates and neither got it because it was deleted and the responsibilities were distributed among others.  Oh, and this happened a full month before I even interviewed, right about the time it was posted on LinkedIn!\r\n\r\nSo, in short, there was never a job available!
