When I saw who they hired (persons with less experience, less personality, and consistently only women), I could only conclude that they had this person already in line and chosen. The interviews were simply a fulfillment of law, procedure, and an illusion. To get a full-time position, a faculty member has to die or retire. 2/3 of faculty at Miami Dade is adjunct. The school makes a lot of money off the backs of cheap labor from professors who make less than their full-time faculty and they receive no benefits whatsoever. Many adjuncts are on food stamps. They are at the whim of a chairperson who may or may not give them classes if the Chairperson likes or dislikes the faculty. I've seen Chairpersons dislike a faculty for idiotic idiosyncrasies and deliberately refuse to give them classes, despite those faculty members having consistently great reviews from the students. Chairpersons are never evaluated by adjunct faculty though there can be many abuses.
