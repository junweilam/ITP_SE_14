Internal positions are set up only to be viewed internally by employees.  However, I decided not to challenge the matter with her.

I was completely unaware of this as I had a friend in this same position about 3 years ago who was a chain smoker. I don't know if this is something new or what? Once a contingent offer is made, they will do a drug screen which includes a nicotine test, which I did not know about until I went to get my lab requisitions and was told to go immediately for the screens. I came up positive due to my patch and my offer was rescinded, which I'm a little salty about but oh well. I think they hold this requirement back in order to prevent nicotine users from being deceptive - like quitting for a couple days while you're in the recruiting process and then going back to using?

I applied online. The application process included an approximately 45 minute aptitude test with SAT-like problem solving questions (questions like: if Person A is travelling from point A at 55 mph, and Person B is travelling from Point B at 40mph, when do they meet in the middle?). I thought that was a bit odd for an application, but I continued on with the process. I received an invitation to interview a few days later. \r\n\r\nThe initial interview was on the phone with a friendly and knowledgeable HR rep. The in person interview included a meeting with the provost, a presentation to a small group (that I was given resources to prepare for), and a one on one interview with the manager for the position. Everyone involved was friendly and respectful. I was offered the position that afternoon at 54k/yr, and negotiated up to 56k/yr. I accepted at that point. \r\n\r\nI came onsite to complete a drug screening and finish filling out paperwork. Even though I was not applying for a position in a health field, the amount of paperwork was quite extensive. I went in to give a urine sample and was not able to urinate enough for what they wanted. I was told I could have a second try and could not leave the premises in the interim. I drank some water and waited. For the second try, a nurse said she was required to stand in the room a few feet from me. I was fairly stressed out at this point as I needed to get back to my current job and was under pressure to pee in front of someone, which is not pleasant. I simply could not do it because I was intensely uncomfortable and embarrassed at this point.\r\n\r\nThe offer was rescinded for that reason. They did not give any alternatives -- it was pee on command or have the job offer taken back. The manager and HR rep I talked to tried to look into what they could do, but could not do anything. I find it unbelievable that they were willing to reject candidates because they could not urinate enough. Instead of providing some type of alternative test, which they are perfectly equipped to do being a hospital system, they will instead be spending more time, money, and resources to find another candidate.", "Interview Questions": "How do you handle people who do not follow the instructions you give them?"}, {"date": "12 Jun 2016", "title": "Medical Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 days.\u00a0I interviewed at CHI (College Station, TX) in Apr 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview consisted of myself, my future office manager and her boss that is in charge of all the urgent care clinics.

We were both extended written offers shortly following our interviews. During my interviews, I was led to believe that I was interviewing for a newly created medical director position for an expanding service. However, the offer letter specified a staff level position and a salary offer that was less than the median.  The real problems with leadership and administration's lack of transparency and integrity emerged during negotiations over a 2-month period. I found it odd that in late stage negotiations, the physician recruiter continued to be the point of contact rather than physician leadership or administration.  During my second meeting with FMG leadership to finalize our negotiations, I was assured of their commitment to employ me and to resolve the few outstanding issues. The CEO indicated that he would have resolution and would contact me by a specified date; however, he never called. During the next 2 weeks, I attempted to contact the CEO on many occasions to no avail. My calls and emails were ignored. I was surprised to learn of the CEO's decision to hire another physician for the position in an email that he inadvertently sent to my fianc\u00e9 and to several other uninvolved individuals on the distribution list. After the email blunder, he lacked the professionalism and courtesy to contact me to apologize or to offer an explanation. My fianc\u00e9 has a similar unfavorable opinion of FMG leadership. Her requests for clarification regarding key responsibilities, reporting mechanism, contractual terms were dismissed by administration. She was told that rather than being overly concerned about the details of the job, \"it is more important to employ the right person.\"  Her letter of offer contained the name of another individual within the narrative. Maybe a simple oversight, but when taken altogether, in our opinion, the leadership was dishonest or non-transparent at the minimum, grossly unprofessional and cost us valuable time and energy in our pursuit of employment.", "Interview Questions": "I applied on line for a posted position.
