His assistant contacted me, only via email, to schedule the in person interview. I unfortunately had a mandatory business trip and an important meeting on the 2 days offered. Assistant wrote me back (never picked up phone) and told me I was no longer a candidate because I couldn\u2019t make the two dates offered. Scheduling issues could have been resolved with a simple phone call. Clearly they don\u2019t care that candidates must protect their current job and can\u2019t drop everything with very short notice.

The interviews itself were not difficult. I had to follow up to see if a decision had been made as I had not heard anything after almost a week following the meeting with the president.
