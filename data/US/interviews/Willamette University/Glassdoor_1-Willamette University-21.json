Day-long on site, in person - which included a presentation (that one faculty member was nodding off in) and several group interviews with faculty, students and staff. I sent a follow up thank you note - the hiring committee chair requested to initiate my reference checks. Simultaneously, a faculty member did an accidental \"reply all\" from my thank you follow up email, complaining about how I didn't properly address him as \"Dr. So-and-so.\" I literally teach professional etiquette, and utilized more general terminology to address the group, because the school website wasn't updated with everyone's proper name, education and title, so I didn't want to offend anyone. I addressed them all professionally with the partial information I had. I withdrew my application - no way I'd want to work with faculty like that! I couldn't work with someone who is so unreasonably offended, and for their inability to professionally communicate via email, and for the way they spoke about all candidates in their email. Completely unprofessional and unbecoming for someone with a terminal degree.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work here?

Post-interview, they got back to me within a week, as promised. The response was, unfortunately, a 'no', but with no reasons given. I wrote back asking how I missed their marks, but as is usual in these kinds of things, I've heard nothing since and would be surprised if I do. That's the single thing I wish had happened.
