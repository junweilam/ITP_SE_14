We\u2019re talking WAY below market value.\n\nHere\u2019s the story:\n\nI received a phone call confirming that the position was seeking someone with 4-5 years\u2019 experience and masters degree preferred (which I meet). Phone call went very well, followed by a very positive panel interview with five people.\n\nThe next day, I received an offer that was 63% of the market value for this position. I was flabbergasted. I politely expressed concern that this is well below the salary I\u2019m seeing for comparable jobs and also well below the salary I already earned. (It was actually barely above what I made at my first job out of college with zero experience and no masters).\n\nThe response I received sounded almost alarmed that I would seek to ask \u201cthat\u201d much. I thanked them for the experience but let them know I definitely can\u2019t take an entry level salary with over 4 years of experience and an advanced degree. \n\nThe final straw was when they tried to sell me on it being a benefit to work for a big name school, which at this point bordered on insulting. (Is the name going to allow me to afford living in Orange County? Probably not.)\n\nDespite the conversations going well and everyone involved being pleasant, I was dumbfounded at the offer and at the insinuation that it was somehow fair or standard. \n\nA few weeks later, I received an offer almost 60% higher than this one, asking for similar experience and with no mention of an MA degree. This was right on par with market value.\n\nMy advice is this: do not expect to see an offer at market value here. Maybe PhDs are paid fairly here or something, but certainly, by the looks of it, not staff. If you do interview, don\u2019t let them tell you that the industry or nonprofit status means you have to accept what\u2019s barely a living wage. The offer I ended up accepting is also a nonprofit. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m just a tad bit salty, but it\u2019s hard enough to get by in such an expensive place, and to see successful institutions so severely undervalue qualified young applicants is just so discouraging to see.", "Interview Questions": "What are your strengths?
