High time commitments but accommodating to schedule changes.\r\n-Google meeting with two data team employees with video on. More personal interaction though still exclusively technically focused questions. This was a good opportunity to get a sense of the teams and culture internally.\r\n-Turn in a second technical problem assessment on a schedule.\r\n-Google meeting with video on with two employees who you would report through/up to. Most of this meeting I was listening not talking. The highest ranking person spoke very little and listened in on the call, so I had sense of their impression of anything that was said. The main interviewer rephrased my words with a critical manner, not quite for understanding or interpersonal reasons. It was a surprisingly cold interaction with a candidate they kept along in their process for so long.\r\n\r\nOverall high time investment with low human feedback.

The entire process was very well delineated and communicated, and all through video conferencing since that offers the best quality of communication.
