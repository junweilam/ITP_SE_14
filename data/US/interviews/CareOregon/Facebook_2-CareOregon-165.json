Had a nice panel interview with two Directors, waited two and a half weeks to hear back with a generic 'no thank you'. My only contact in the department was an administrative assistant who never returned my emails when I tried to follow up after each interview. I was pretty disappointed to have no contact, and for the process to be dragged out for so long, to have it unceremoniously be a 'no' in the end.

CareOregon however lacked any sense of professionalism. The interview itself was a waste of time and just plain frivolous. This is the job description that they sent to staffing agency. What the heck was I supposed to do with this? This job description is useless. It is just so astonishingly vague (troubleshooting. It just says troubleshooting.) \"There are about 700-1000 Win10 machines that need to be re-imaged as some of their SW programs are not running smoothly on the current image. Most of the imaging of these devices have been completed and now they need 2 people to help with the incoming machines to either fix them for re-deployment or retire them. They also want them to be flexible in the duties they perform every day. Some days they will do phone support, some days deployments, some days building accounts for new hires and getting new machines ready to go. Be flexible.

I still haven't heard from CareOregon\" so I got a text back from my recruiter with a screen shot that said he had \"some fires to put out\" and wanted to reschedule for 1:00 pm and I confirmed for the 1:00 pm reschedule.

To echo a previous review, the whole process was very disorganized and unprofessional. \nI had multiple panel interviews with part or all of the very large team via video conference. Red flags abound:\n1)They have NINE database developers at a company with less than 1,000 employees. If a company is automating their data and analytics processes correctly, they don't need anywhere near that amount of redundancy. When asked why they were hiring a tenth database developer, they were unable to articulate what the role would actually be doing other than replacing someone who retired.\n2)The final 90 minute panel interview included the entire team. How is any work getting done when the entire team is sitting in interviews for that amount of time? Who is handling any potential production issues?\n3)They didn\u2019t ask me any questions about data warehouse architecture/patterns, advanced SQL or anything appropriate for a senior developer with 15 years of experience. I got lazy fluff questions you\u2019d ask a recent college graduate like \u201cWhat is your favorite file versioning software?\u201d and \u201cRate your SQL skills on a scale of 1-5.\u201d\n4)Hazing is alive and well. One of the devs rattled off a list of fields and asked me to verbally code something with purposely vague requirements. When I commented this would be a lot easier and more realistic to do in a code editor, he sneered \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to ask questions.\u201d I had already completed a coding assessment and received positive feedback, so I\u2019m baffled as to what he was trying to accomplish. He looked to be in his late 40\u2019s, so I can only assume he still thinks companies are doing whiteboard coding and hazing to find candidates who will put up with anything.
