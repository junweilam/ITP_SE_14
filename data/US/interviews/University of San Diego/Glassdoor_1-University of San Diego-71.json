Very pleased with that, as it took less than 1 week to set up a phone interview. The phone interview went well, and I liked the enthusiasm I received from one male and one female--both leadership--from the IT department. They reached out less than another week later to confirm an in-person interview. Again, I was very pleased. I am familiar with the excess amount of time taken by a lot of educational facilities when it comes to hiring, and USD defied those beliefs.\r\n\r\nOn the day I arrived for my interview, I received amiable, kind, clear communication from every employee with whom I interacted, and was beginning to get excited about the prospect of working for USD. I thought the interaction went extremely well among the hiring managers and myself. Most everyone (students included of course), seemed youthful and hip in the department. I felt that I was a solid technical fit, as well as a great candidate for the culture. There were a few minor things with which I was under-experienced, but I felt positive about growing into the role, and quickly adopting any missing \"pluses\".\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, I was given a two-page copy of a written test, challenging me with some technical questions which were more overly basic. A couple of them required some memorization of where certain Windows directories are located, where to find network settings, and things of that nature. I utilized the full 20 minutes to fill out my exam. The next day, I sent a thank-you email regarding the positive experience I'd had. No response from that, but that is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 days went by after the interview, and I hadn't heard a thing. Feeling confident that USD had been on spring break for 7 of those days helped me remain patient. Another 5-6 days went by, and I decided to send a follow-up email just to say hello, and expressing hope that they'd found the right person for the job--and if not, to let me know, as I was still interested. It has now been two full weeks since I sent that email, and I have received no communication at all. I believe it to be proper, kind, and culturally sensitive to at least reply to an email like that, letting the candidate know that they've either moved on, or else-wise. \r\n\r\nWhereas every part of the initial interview went great, the non-responsiveness just blew me away, especially after receiving such initial kindness. I'm shocked that a hiring manager won't even take 5 minutes to reply to his or her candidates, just to say \"thank you\" or \"thanks, but no thanks\". I found this to be rather an ungraceful exit to an otherwise positive experience, and that just left me feeling a bit confused and discarded.", "Interview Questions": "Not necessarily difficult, but a bit unexpected: They asked for the exact location of the User's Outlook directory in Windows 7. Now I know where this is, and I go there routinely, but sometimes the things one does every day are difficult to conjure up.
