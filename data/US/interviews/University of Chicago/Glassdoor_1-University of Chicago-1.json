I know this because I interviewed at two departments at the same time and the interview process couldn\u2019t have been more different.\n\nThis review is for my application with Globus. The other interview I had was with a department within UChicago Medicine, which is a separate company here on Glassdoor, so I put it there.\n\nThe first step was a take home assignment in Flask/Python. The assignment was to write a simple REST API, with the option of adding unit tests.\n\nOnce they review your take home, if you pass, they schedule a coding interview with a senior dev.\n\nIf you pass the coding interview they schedule a technical interview with the manager, who asks a design question to quiz you on architectural principles, as well as specific knowledge of authn/authz and other components of a distributed application.\n\nOnce you pass this stage there is a second coding + technical questions interview with another senior dev.\n\nThe final round is a 1-on-1 with the director of Globus, Kyle Chard, who\u2019s extremely nice and pleasant to talk to.\n\nI went through all these rounds thinking that the next step was going to be an offer, since I made it that far and had good rapport with Kyle. Alas, I received a rejection and later feedback.\n\nThe thing that seemed odd was that the feedback seemed to refer to a very small issue around the first technical interview. To be clear, my code ran, the issue was that I apparently asked a question or two of something that \u201cshould\u2019ve been obvious\u201d. I found this odd because I don\u2019t remember struggling with the coding problem. My guess is that it was probably a close call between myself and another candidate but they had to come up with feedback that was better than, \u201cwe kept you interviewing for an additional 2 weeks because we were hedging the possibility that our preferred candidate left/got another offer.\u201d\n\nOn the whole the experience felt negative because I was given a the impression talking to Kyle was the proverbial finish line, and I had no reason to believe I wouldn\u2019t be getting the job.

I know this because I interviewed at two departments at the same time and the interview process couldn\u2019t have been more different.\n\nThis review is for my application with Globus. The other interview I had was with a department within UChicago Medicine, which is a separate company here on Glassdoor, so I put it there.\n\nThe first step was a take home assignment in Flask/Python. The assignment was to write a simple REST API, with the option of adding unit tests.\n\nOnce they review your take home, if you pass, they schedule a coding interview with a senior dev.\n\nIf you pass the coding interview they schedule a technical interview with the manager, who asks a design question to quiz you on architectural principles, as well as specific knowledge of authn/authz and other components of a distributed application.\n\nOnce you pass this stage there is a second coding + technical questions interview with another senior dev.\n\nThe final round is a 1-on-1 with the director of Globus, Kyle Chard, who\u2019s extremely nice and pleasant to talk to.\n\nI went through all these rounds thinking that the next step was going to be an offer, since I made it that far and had good rapport with Kyle. Alas, I received a rejection and later feedback.\n\nThe thing that seemed odd was that the feedback seemed to refer to a very small issue around the first technical interview. To be clear, my code ran, the issue was that I apparently asked a question or two of something that \u201cshould\u2019ve been obvious\u201d. I found this odd because I don\u2019t remember struggling with the coding problem. My guess is that it was probably a close call between myself and another candidate but they had to come up with feedback that was better than, \u201cwe kept you interviewing for an additional 2 weeks because we were hedging the possibility that our preferred candidate left/got another offer.\u201d\n\nOn the whole the experience felt negative because I was given a the impression talking to Kyle was the proverbial finish line, and I had no reason to believe I wouldn\u2019t be getting the job.

I would concentrate on highlighting working with kids in the past, and if you don't have that experience, highlight group activities and projects that required you to educate people, or at least have enormous amounts of patience (ie, if you were a director of a theater production, etc.) Once your resume is chosen, you come in for a 1:1 interview, which is really relaxed, but the most important aspect is to be as enthusiastic and personable as possible-- your future kids have to LIKE you in order to respect you and learn from you. A passion for education and helping others is a must. \r\n\r\nThe office is absolutely great-- they are willing to work with you, and understand if you cannot work some days.

The interview was conducted one on one and because I met with the senior business analyst first, I was able to better tailor my questions to the project manager. The 2 interviews lasted a total of about an hour and a half. To prepare for the interview, I went to geekinterview.com to get a list of some of the questions I would probably see for that position.
