Several weeks later, I received an email invitation for a video interview.  You set up your computer to use camera and microphone then access the interview within a 5-day window.  There are 5 video questions, and you have about 3 minutes to give a video response.  You get two attempts at each question.  This was not made clear (only that you would have multiple attempts).  If you want to preview a question then pause to compose a response, you only have one response attempt remaining.  I did not like the video interview because it is one-sided.  I feel that if I am going to invest myself in the process, I should get something back at every step, such as the ability to ask a question or get a feel for what kind of place it is.  I put some effort into the video interview, but I deliberately did not strive to present my best due to it being one-sided.  Several weeks later, I received an invitation to interview with the committee, and I was told that I would deliver a 15-minute lecture to students, and compose a writing sample.  The choices of interview dates and times was very narrow.  I was not available for any of the time slots, but I negotiated a different interview date by email.  Upon arrival, I had a 15 minute interview with an administrator, then I was taken to a classroom full of students and the committee, where I delivered my lecture.  The 15 minute limit was enforced strictly.  The students were dismissed and asked to prepare their evaluations, which they deposited outside the door while I was interviewing with the committee.  The actual interview was about average.  I would call it a positive experience.  The committee had members from three or four disciplines, and they seem like colleagues that I would want to work with.  At the conclusion of the interview, I was told that I would be contacted in a week, and I was escorted to the writing center where my writing prompt was waiting.  I was given a copy of my writing sample before I left.  I was never contacted, and now three months have gone by.  The position status is still pending, although the fall semester is about to begin in 2-3 weeks.  Six weeks after the interview, I contacted HR, and they said that I was still a candidate, and the matter was still in the hands of the committee.  Some committees are slow, and HR has no control over that, they said.  I think it is unprofessional for my contacts to leave me hanging for all of this time with no follow-up or explanation about the status.
