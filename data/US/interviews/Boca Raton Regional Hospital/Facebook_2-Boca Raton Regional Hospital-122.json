They asked mostly personal questions, like why do you want to work here, why you want to be an assistant, and a lot of scenario situations, like \"how would you handle yourself if this happened\" or \"what would you do if a patient was being rude to you?\" They didn't really focus too much on my experience, but they did ask where I worked now, and why I was looking for a new job.

I received a call back from an HR recruiter 6 days later. There was a phone screening, where I was asked about my certifications and experience. We talked about shifts and hours. She discussed pay with me right then because she noticed from my application that I was making more than the position offered. She told me that the pay for 2 years experience and I gave her a different number that I wanted, and she told me the pay was non-negotiable. I said fine. She put me through for an interview with two hiring Nurses on the floor for the following week (for a unit I didn't have enough experience for surprisingly).\r\n\r\nThere were two hiring nurses there to interview me for the first round of questioning. They asked me to tell them about myself, they asked about experience, skills, certifications, and future education plans. I got the feeling they were very interested in me because I'm a student who plans to further my education and could grow within the hospital. They also asked behavioral questions and gave me scenarios I may be put in and asked what I would do, etc. They were both nice! After they finished, they brought in two RN's who work on the floor and told me they (the hiring nurses) were going to leave and give me a chance to ask the RN's anything I wanted to know about what it's like to work there without them in the room. Then the RN's also questioned me. They were also nice, and asked many of the same questions as the hiring nurses did. That second round of questioning was much shorter than the first. After that, one of the hiring nurses came back in and offered to give me a tour of the unit. As we walked around she kept stopping to introduce me to people who would be my co-workers. She told me what the next steps would be: a 2 day orientation and a 2 week preceptor-ship. She also mentioned (two times) that she still had two other candidates to interview before she was going to make a decision.\r\n\r\nA week went by and I didn't hear back, so I called to follow up because I had another offer from another hospital pending. When I called the HR recruiter offered me the position with the pay she quoted me during the phone screening. I told her I would need to consider it, and I would let her know in 24 hours. I originally emailed and declined their offer because the other hospital made me a better one. Within 5 minutes I got a call from HR wanting to find out why I didn't accept the offer, and they wanted to know if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I explained to them that I had a better offer from somewhere else and then she made me a better offer than that one! So I waited a day to consider and then ended up accepting the position after all. Which is funny because she originally said it was non-negotiable, yet she increased the hourly rate by almost $3.00. It just goes to show, don't let anyone tell you a hospital staff salary isn't negotiable! Because it IS!
