She then told me she would be on vacation for a week and she would have an update for me then. On Thursday I got an email that I was being moved to next steps and they were requesting 4 references. So of course I let my references know to expect to hear from them. In the middle of the next week after my references hadn't heard from her I emailed asking for an update. After a week and a half after my email I emailed again and asked if they could please give me an update so I could let my references know to no longer expect a call or exactly what was going on. It took another few days for her to email back telling me they selected another candidate. Overall, this was one of the most unprofessional experiences I have had during an interview process.
