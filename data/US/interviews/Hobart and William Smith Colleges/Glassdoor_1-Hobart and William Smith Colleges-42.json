The portal was not very user friendly but not unmanageable. I received a call for an on site interview. Visitor parking was about a ten minute walk from the HR building. The interview was a panel of the director and three other human resources team members. The director was very brash and insulting. She would ask questions and then wave her hand in my face and say \"ok!\" if I took to long to answer. When I adjusted my answers to accommodate her she would ask me to explain more; when I did she would allow me a few more sentences before say \"ok! I got it!\". When I asked about the departments culture, one of the team members laughed in my face and said it was \"tense since (the director) came on. There is a lot of butting heads\". The other ladies sat their with tense smiles. I knew after the first questions I could not work for a director like that, and the tension in that room was so thick you could cut through it with a spoon. I think I could have worked nicely with the other staff, but that director is a nightmare! Then I never even got a no thank you letter, even after I sent a than you email. This place is a wreck!
