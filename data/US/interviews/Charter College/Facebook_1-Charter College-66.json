I applied for the Admissions Representative position and again had an interview with Arde from Vegas. She tried to say that the reps had been there for a long time and they were mature. She asked me to describe what I thought the student population was like and she informed me that I described it well and she asked me to tell her how I would be relatable to them. I thought I described it well enough but during the interview process she seemed completely disinterested in me again just like the first time. At the end I asked her if she had any concerns with my abilities and she said tell you what you can take another assessment and then if your results are ok I will refer you on.

I submitted my information as requested.  I then had to follow up by, among other things, calling their national headquarter in Nevada.  After getting a run-around for several weeks, I was given two telephone screens.  Since I made the grade, I was then given a battery of online tests.  I passed them successfully.  I then was brought in to the office for an interview with the Admissions Director.  An interview that lasted over an hour and a half.  Things looked promising.  I was called in for a follow-up interview with the president.  That interview started with the basic, \"Tell me what you know about our company.\"  So trite.  It went downhill from there.  I did not feel a connection with the President at all.  \r\n\r\nI had been told that they were anxious to get someone in the position ASAP.  Everything looked like a \"go.\"  Then, after waiting for a week, I called the office to find out the status of my interviews.  No response.  They had highlighted in the interview how much they valued follow-up.  I called again and again received no response.  \r\n\r\nI eventually received a call from the HR Manager, who was based in their Nevada office.  She said that the Admissions Director was no longer with the company and that they would no longer be pursuing employment with me.  She apologized that she couldn't give me additional information or feedback on my interviews.\r\n\r\nSo, after successfully passing their tests and being through numerous interviews, I did not get the job.
