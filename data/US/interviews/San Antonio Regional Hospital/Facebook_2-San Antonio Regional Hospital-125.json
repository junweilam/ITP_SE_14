A panel interview was conducted by three members of ED staff. Comfortable environment but some questions were not geared towards a New Grad RN. \r\n\r\nWhen taking time to answer a difficult question (and not sound stupid), I was told on multiple occasions to \"just think of something\" and felt rushed. I was also interrupted on quite a few occasions and two of the panel members decided to have a side conversation towards the end of the interview. In addition, after sending all of my documents (resume, cover letter, certs/license, etc.) to a specific ED staff member three or more times, it was obvious that none of the information had been viewed beforehand.\r\n\r\nOverall, the entire experience gave the feeling that candidates had already been chosen for the program and that I was most likely interviewed so the hospital could maintain a good relationship with my reference. Even applying for additional New Grad RN/Entry Level positions after this experience, it seems like the hospital tends to hire those New Grad RNs who came through their facility during clinicals or hires those who have a STRONG connection to the hospital (relatives, financial donors, etc.).
