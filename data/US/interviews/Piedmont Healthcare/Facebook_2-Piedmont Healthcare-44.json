However, they did not seem to be looking for crisis nurses in particular and asked the standard interview questions you might expect in any nursing interview. \r\n\r\nMy biggest problem was when I asked how their operations had been affected by the coronavirus situation and what kind of plans they had in place. I wasn't expecting anything super detailed, yet they were unable to provide any meaningful response. To summarize, they said operations had not really been affected and that the virus wasn't really bad here yet, something that is patently false and speaks to a lack of foresight and awareness of management. Instead, they emphasized the value of customer service...not a bad thing in and of itself, but in the context of my question seemed inappropriate. \r\n\r\nGiven my experience with the interview, I accepted another offer shortly after finishing the call.
