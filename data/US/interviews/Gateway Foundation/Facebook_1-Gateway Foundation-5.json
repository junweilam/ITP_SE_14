Both interviewers read questions off of papers and both seemed unprepared and quite honestly -  unfriendly or more like - stressed.

As a 0 hour Counselor Intern I didn't have any experience with this type of work, but I did have education and all the questions were related to how you would handle yourself in a stressful or questionable situation.

I've heard Gateway is great about hiring counselors with little to no experience, but I advise making sure you go in prepared to answer specific questions about how you should react when faced with difficult situations in a prison. As a strengths-oriented counselor, I walked away feeling like I wish I'd had a chance to discuss my strengths. The questions were oriented to mistakes you'd made, people you didn't get along with, your weaknesses, and problems you might face.
