I had a first round phone interview on a federal holiday, MLK Jr. Day, as I was told this would facilitate the hiring process. This was a mostly positive experience, and it was followed by a second round in-person interview on site, for which I'm local and luckily didn't have to travel. This experience was overall pleasant, if not unorganized, and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the staff and students. I was then informed that there would be a third round interview for those progressing. This is where the process becomes rather murky. \r\n\r\nI followed up with my interviewers 6 weeks after the interview, and I received no response. I understand this is common practice, but the position remained open until the new fiscal year began on July 3, when it was reposted. I was notified of the rejection the same day the job was reopened, which is a highly questionable practice. \r\n\r\nFurther, I received a general form letter, a practice more common in pre-screening candidates than second round interviews. I am not concerned about the rejection, but I attempted to explain my concerns about the lack of professionalism and transparency, especially after a four-month silence. The recruiter told me her understanding was that that I had been informed, and that her notice was an \"informal notification to close the hiring process.\" This is absurd coming from the HR department writing from an official university email account. I tried contacting the HR Office on campus to express my concerns, but I was redirected back to the recruiter. I've been in higher education for over a decade and have advanced degrees.

She left a voicemail, and she sent an email with the same information.\r\n\r\nI replied via email and was able to schedule the interview for the following week.  There was a scheduling conflict with my schedule and the Hiring Manager's schedule.\r\n\r\nThe interview was scheduled at the MANGO Building 650, at the Modesto A. Maidique Campus, and I was told I would be meeting with the Executive Director of Marketing, Communications, & Recruitment, the Associate Director of Marketing & Communications, and the Employee Services Coordinator.\r\n\r\nThere is no FREE parking on this campus, be prepared to pay for parking using your mobile phone and the PayByPhone App.  The Building itself is fairly new and modern, there is a Starbucks and a Panda Express on the first floor.  Take the elevator behind panda express to go to the FIU Online offices (5th & 6th floor, I believe).  I was a bit early, so I had to wait a bit before the interview.  The offices looked very nice, but everyone there seemed a bit too busy to be nice and say good morning/afternoon or even acknowledge the fact that there was someone there waiting to be interviewed, which I found a bit odd and rude.\r\n\r\nThe Marketing team members came upstairs from the other floor and then were directed to the conference room where the interview would be held.  I waited a bit for that as well.  I am not sure if I was the first person being interviewed for this position or not, but I got the feeling they were not prepared to interview me.  I was also told I would be interviewing with 3 other people, who would be my superiors or the Employee Services Coordinator, so I printed 3 copies of my resume and had them ready... only to find that another person would be joining us, which would be a co-worker.  Another Graphic Designer.  I thought it was a bit odd that they would bring a co-worker to the interview.  I understand why, but I feel like after you had a few possible candidates and came for a second interview, that would be the time to introduce the co-workers, I am not sure why the other Graphic Designer was involved in the interview process.\r\n\r\nOverall, I thought the interview had a good flowing conversational environment.  What I got from them was that they are a very small team and only recently have grown from 2 to 6-7 people.  I am not sure who they all are, but seemed like a very small operation.  They will be looking for a copyrighter and a traffic manager in the future, possibly.  They are in charge of the FIU ONLINE marketing only, and their target market are students who would take their entire degrees online, a fully online degree, graduate or undergraduate.  They just moved to that building.\r\n\r\nThey are faced paced, and have a balance of a lot of production to put out ads using templates.  But they also have some times when they can be creative and come up with new art.\r\n\r\nThey have a Monitor up where you can show your portfolio from the web, or hook up your ipad to it.
