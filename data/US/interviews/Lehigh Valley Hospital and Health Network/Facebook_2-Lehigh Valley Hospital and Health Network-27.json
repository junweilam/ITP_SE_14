I was then interviewed in person- again went great. Both times, I was offered a range of salary and with my experience, I was on the high range of that. I was offered a position, which I accepted. Everything was great until I spoke to HR. HR was absolutely unprofessional and that's coming from someone currently in school for HR via SHRM. She gave me one LOW BALL OFFER. When I explained, I spoke about this with the department and that I had 12 years experience, she tried to belittle me by saying that \" you only have NINE years experience\" lol. I reminded her I had TWO children inbetween and even though I did, I still remained EMPLOYED during and regardless that I was not entry level. For someone in HR, she was absolutely unprofessional and confrontational. She said she would speak to the department and get back to me. There was silence for about four days! I reached out to the department and explained what happened. She emailed me again (in writing) the salary range and again, it was a range I was happy with. It was BOE and I had experience! Then HR sent me an email RESCINDING THEIR OFFER because I was \"over the pay range.\" There was absolutely NO negotiation, there was no communication it was disorganized and disappointing. As someone who worked in the field, again for twelve years in management positions; it's quite disappointing and they should quite honestly be embarrassed at themselves. I had higher hopes for such a big health network. When I emailed HR- I asked kindly- why they rescinded their offer, when the department sent me an email that morning- with a range I was happy with? I was met with silence. Perhaps other departments and other people in HR are better- but there is so much mismanagement going on there; that honestly I dodged a bullet.

We set up a virtual interview and I was very impressed by the VP.  Although she didn't think I was a good fit for the role I applied, she saw value in me and offered me a different position that sounded good to me.  A few days later I spoke with the hiring manager, who was also very nice, if not desperate for more people because of high workload.\n\nThe VP and I agreed on a number, and mentioned we were both flexible and would meet somewhere in the middle.  She reached out to me and said to expect an offer.  I was shocked a week later when the offer was 30% below what we had discussed, and would result in a huge pay cut for me.  I reached out to the VP to ask where to disconnect was, and to her credit she responded quickly and said she was 'disappointed in the offer she could extend.'\n\nHere's what happened: HR overrode her decision and decided to lowball me based on an internal \"equity comparison/compensation\" pricing model, that reduces people to numbers on a spreadsheet and probably needs to be updated post-covid.  It astounds me that the same companies that are desperate to hire workers and complain that \"no one wants to work\" will turn right around and lowball people.  It's even more shocking to me that an HR department, who never even had a conversation with me prior to calling me to extend an offer, would override a VP's decision as to the value I bring to her team.  Why did you put that VP in her role if you don't trust her judgement?  Clearly, they just took a quick look at my resume for my age, and decided I wasn't worth what the VP and I both agreed I was worth.  Given what they are probably spending on travelling nurses and contractors these days, I find that downright insulting.\n\nAnd, gee, I wonder why the hiring manager is so desperate for more people.  This position has been open for weeks and I keep seeing it get reposted.  But, hey, if you want to hire cheap labor, only to have them leave two years from now when they realize how underpaid they are, who am I to tell you how to run your company?\n\nIf you apply for a job here, expect to be lowballed by HR - it won't matter what you and the hiring manager agreed to.

Lots of steps to go through but also lots of help available to navigate it. \r\nIt starts with an on-line assessment which seemed to measure your degree of cultural competence and tolerance. If you pass this, your references are thoroughly checked and you then go on to an in-person interview. \r\nIf hired, you go on to get a physical in the network, finger printed&cleared, and lastly, meet with HR to explain benefits. That whole process took about 6 weeks start to finish.", "Interview Questions": "The actual interview was very pleasant and casual as it takes place by the hiring unit manager. The difficult part was the general hospital orientation followed by a general nursing orientation. It's long and, as a nurse, you are expected to take a generalized pharmacology exam even if you are not giving meds in your position. To be fair, you are offered resources to help you through it and are offered retakes should you fail. In my orientation class, many experienced nurses had to retake this test at least once...including me. I recognize the need for such an evaluation, but it might make more sense to have it be unit specific.
