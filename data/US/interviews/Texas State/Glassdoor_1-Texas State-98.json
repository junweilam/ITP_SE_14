I applied online using their cumbersome application process on 1/21/16. The following week 2/28/16, I got a call and a follow up email to interview on 2/1/16. \r\n\r\nA word of caution about parking: make sure to be on campus at least an hour before your interview time. As a former student, I knew exactly where to park and knew the building location. I just had to find the office location. I arrived 45 minutes ahead of time and the parking employee told me that they hadn't reserved a visitors' spot. WHAT?! The email clearly told me to park in the visitors' spot! The parking guard gave me a visitors' pass so I wouldn't get towed, but said I was not allowed to park in the visitors' spot. WHAT?! So, I wasted at least 30 minutes of my time circling the parking lot trying to find a spot and running across said parking lot back to the darn building. I then spent about 10 minutes climbing stairs and trying to find the correct office. If I had known I wasn't going to be able to use a visitors' spot, I would have arrived earlier. I barely made my interview time. I normally like to be there 15 minutes early and felt this incident could have adversely effected my chances for this job. \r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge during the interview was the time limit. They claimed interview times were limited to 30 minutes to mimic the time/experience the advisor has with students. It was incredibly difficult to cram a discussion of my extensive experience into just 30 minutes. I ended up using graphic organizers inside a PowerPoint presentation. It was well received. I interviewed with three women: the department chair, an advisor, and a supervising advisor. Everyone was pleasant and polite, but it was very rushed and I don't feel that any of us got the information we needed. They wanted to know why I was coming back to TXST to work instead of teaching. (I fail to see why that was even an issue.) I explained that as part of my private tutoring business I advised high school students prepping for college and enjoyed it. I wanted to take those skills to the college level. I blinked, the interview was over, and I was being shoved out the door. As I left, I was told that I should hear back from HR in about two weeks. \r\n\r\nI was very eager to hear back from TXST and emailed the interviewer on 2/8/16. She told me the position had been filled and I was crushed. I followed-up and requested advice/tips for my next interview. (I was fishing for a reason why I wasn't hired. I was clearly qualified for the position.) She replied with some generic answer that didn't make any sense.

I had a standard panel interview with three library employees. Basic academic librarianship questions asked in a lackluster robotic manner was the first red flag, with one interviewer constantly and feverishly writing notes hardly ever looking up. I should have politely excused myself, knowing right then and there this was not a good fit as the professionalism took a nosedive thereafter! Over more casual conversation at lunch, I began to realize that I had been called in simply as a required second candidate due to university red tape requirements for interviewing a minimum of two persons for any position. I doubt I had a genuine chance as, in their minds, they already had the person they wished for the job. (In other words, they used me simply as a second body to hire someone else!) To me, this is a huge waste of time, resources and money on all sides. When I was given the chance at the end to ask my own questions, I first thanked them all for the opportunity to interview, and tactfully asked the question \"What about me drew you to invite me to interview for the position?\" The interviewer who eventually responded could not even look me in the eye and muttered something incoherent. I'm still unsure to this day as to what they attempted to say. Further, I even had to show myself out as this individual suddenly became \"too busy\" to walk me out. Most bizarre interview I've ever had! University policy states that the hiring manager is to contact all candidates interviewed as to the hiring decision. Despite having sent thank you correspondence to each person with whom I interviewed, I was never contacted by anyone at Texas State as to the status of my application.
