Third and final interview was, again, virtual with Academic IT. Submitted references (survey format for those submitting references on my behalf) and completed Babson's \"new\" Manager Assessment simulation. I prepped for the simulation and though it wasn't straightforward or library-related in any way, I thought I did well. The simulation was centered on an important client who just launched your company's software, which was not working as expected. Part of the simulation also involved a live video discussion with an actor essentially playing the part of an employee who was not willing to do their load of the work. Again, I thought it went well. This is where it starts to get shady/dubious: the Talent Acquisition person calls to offer me the position and the proposed salary is the max in the range (range was $76-84k). In summary: three VIRTUAL interviews, I never meet the director in person, never meet the library staff, and, conversely, they never meet me, and Babson offers the max salary. This is where my identity comes into play: I'm not White, I understand Babson, like many higher-ed institutions, wants to get on the DEI marketing bandwagon, but it's unimaginable that a prominent business school would hire someone without ever meeting them in person AND offer them the max in the range. My gut certainly said this is illogical. In the end, I accepted the verbal offer, but a day or two later, I received a succinct email from Talent Acquisition stating the offer was contingent based on references and the manager assessment, to which I listened to my gut and inquired whether there was an issue with my references (the same references I've had for the last couple of jobs, which resulted in my getting offers from them and elsewhere). Talent Acquisition stated the combination of the references and manager assessment scores forced them to rescind their offer. And of course, HR cannot share the results of either. It would be interesting to see what readers of this scenario think, and how their respective identities influence their interpretation. Am I, BIPOC-identifying, reading too much into it and it was an objective, metric-based decision, or, did they have other candidates in mind and needed to have a non-White candidate as a finalist? (Mind you, HR stated that once hired, HR's Talent Development team would work with the person to improve areas as noted by the manager assessment. And I have worked in higher education for more than a decade; seven of those years in managing staff.) This is higher-ed and, most importantly, this is the higher-ed experience when you're BIPOC or identify from another marginalized group. You have no idea what the truth is, nor will you ever know. My lesson in this, for the umpteenth time: never trust PWIs if you're BIPOC -  listen to your gut.", "Interview Questions": "Typical library management questions.
