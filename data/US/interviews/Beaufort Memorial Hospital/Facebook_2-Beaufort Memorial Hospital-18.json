Pretty standard interview questions along with a great description of the job and current processes. I also liked how she asked me to tell her about myself in a casual manner. The second part of the interview was what they call a peer-to-peer. I met with 2 other department heads who work closely with the department and that portion of the interview went very well. It was a relaxed interview which felt more like having a conversation rather than being drilled with the same boring interview questions like \"where do you see yourself in 5 years\". They told me a lot about the company, their benefits and the overall work environment. They all have been there over 10 years so  certainly spoke from experience.", "Interview Questions": "Tell them about myself, why I was interested in the position and looking to leave my current one.
