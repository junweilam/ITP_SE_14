She mainly just asked me what salary range I was looking for. About 5 days later, the hiring manager reached out to schedule a phone call. The call was pretty informative and I learned a basic overview of what the position would entail. After about another 5 days, they reached out to schedule a virtual panel interview. \r\n\r\nThe virtual panel interview consisted of two separate panels with 3 people in each. Each panel was an hour long. I was a little surprised how \"corporate-y\" the interviews were. They only asked me \"S.T.A.R\" questions and they were very difficult. I did anticipate some S.T.A.R. questions and prepared for them, but some of these were so specific that preparing only goes so far. They really want you to describe a specific scenario even if you had not actual experienced it before. There were a couple where I said something along the lines of \"Well this never happened to me, but in those scenarios I would ___\". However, they insisted I describe a specific scenario, which I thought was odd. I feel like the concept of what you're trying to convey should be more important instead of basically coming up with a fake scenario but oh well.\r\n\r\nThe interviewers were all very nice, and I learned more about the position and culture. About a week after the panel interview, I was given a \"creative assignment\" to complete.\r\n\r\nAfter I submitted my assignment, I was told I would hear back \"soon\". A week and a half later, I still hadn't heard back. I followed up with them, and they told me they decided to go with another candidate. I would have appreciated it if they had let me know sooner or at least gave me a heads up on when I could expect to hear back about a decision, especially since I was so far along in the process and it sounded like I was in the running. If I hadn't followed up, I don't know if I ever would have heard back from them.\r\n\r\nOverall, the interview process was a lot longer than I anticipated, but St. Jude is such a huge company so I guess it's expected. I applied in February and was declined the offer in April. To be honest, the whole process seemed just a tad overkill, especially for an entry level position. I think throwing in some more normal questions (instead of solely S.T.A.R questions) would be more beneficial for them to get to know candidates better, but perhaps that's just how they have to do it in every department.", "Interview Questions": "I can't really remember them all.

They will contact you and if they want you to come and interview, will set-up travel arrangements.

They work hard at matching the right person with the right labs.  They also offer a lot of advice on matching personality types - as long as you pay attention to what they are saying.  St Jude has a ton to offer, but picking a PI is the MOST important decision you will make and it is extremely important to not let the place and perks overwhelm you.
