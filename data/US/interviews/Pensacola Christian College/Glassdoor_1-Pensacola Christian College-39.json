Nor ever after as well. I have found out afterward that the Employee Services Department wields incredible power at this organization and is quite inflexible and lacking in member care - the number one trait desired in employees is compliance. With hiring at PCC, the priority seems to be filling an empty position and total compliance to the Employee handbook vs. what are your skills and how would you benefit the organization and vice versa. Forget career progression possibilities. You are shown a high quality, informative video presentation of the organization's history and founders. Church attendance at the on-campus Campus Church is absolutely a job requirement and you will fill in attendance slips each week (and they are checked by HR) so forget personal choice or responsibly choosing your own place of worship. During the interview it felt like signing on here was relinquishing much of my personal dignity and freedom of choice in exchange for a paycheck. Much of this was explained as necessary due to it being a ministry - never mind that to a Christian, every job they always work at is/should be automatically that. Also of concern should be the fact that every full-time hire is for at least a one-year contract even for all support jobs and the explanation is that your leaving would impact the school schedule. And if you happen to not be applying exactly before the start of the Fall semester then they'll tack on the remainder of that year until July PLUS one year. Because they can. There is no negotiating anything or flexibility within the interview - which is an accurate preview of the overall work environment that follows. Also, although the company can terminate you with a normal 2 weeks notice, all employees must not only give a 6-month notice (in January) but can only then leave in July (when all employee contracts stop/restart) without being considered a \"contract-breaker\". Be very aware of this going into any interview or accepting a position. Also, I recommend carefully read the entire Employee Handbook before deciding.", "Interview Questions": "Are you in complete agreement with the Employee Handbook in all areas (dress, personal beliefs and standards incl. music, etc.)"}, {"date": "26 Jan 2017", "title": "Dining Services Assistant Manager Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Pensacola Christian College", "Interview Descriptions": "There really wasn't much of one.
