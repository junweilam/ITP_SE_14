However, I did not learn of the format of the interview until the day I arrived. In addition, the interview had a late start and took longer than expected as the details were not communicated to me before hand.

In my experience, they always ask questions about teams and strategic alliances.  There is a huge book of interview questions that you can find on line if you know it exists.  But I heard recently that they are revising it and changing the questions.  The book will give you an idea of the types of questions.
