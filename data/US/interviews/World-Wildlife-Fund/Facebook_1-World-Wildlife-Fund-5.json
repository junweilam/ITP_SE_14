They took over a month to send an automated email inviting me for an interview. The message had several errors stating it was my 2nd interview when it was my first, saying I would get a zoom link 48 hours before and asking me to prepare a presentation with a very vague one line title. I'm lucky I checked the platform an noted this presentation request as the email had no mention of it. They should really make it more clear.\r\n\r\nI didn't receive any zoom link up until the day of my interview and rang, emailed recruitment several times. They did not respond all morning nor to the email I had sent a week before and only phoned me up 5 minutes into my supposed interview to say they couldn't find the link. 15 minutes and another phone call later they found it and got it to me. So I ofcourse entered my interview late. If I had not rang them so many times, I would have missed out on my interview. The interviewer apologised and said they were switching HR systems which was why that happened. I was only asked 6 very basic questions. There were two interviewers (despite my email saying I was speaking to one). This other individual had an angry face the entire interview and was fairly short in her communication. There seemed to be tension in the air.\r\n\r\nI gave my presentation to which they had no feedback apart from saying they liked it and highlighting an idea they liked in particular and thought would be good to implement. When I asked about the timeline of when I should expect to hear back (as I was ofcourse job searching and was expecting another offer but I let them know this role at WWF was my preferred role) they were quite guarded about it and said likely 2 weeks but if I wanted to withdraw I should email them. I told them I had no intention to withdraw as I loved the sound of the job, I just wondered if they had a timeline. I found this quite defeatist and any other interviewer I have asked for a timeline has always been more forthcoming, often even saying to let them know if I needed an answer sooner and they'd try if possible. The interview was then ended. I never heard back from them despite and saw they marked me as unsuccessful on the recruitment platform without giving me any notification or feedback. After following up they told me this was again due to their HR system.\r\n\r\nThe process was a complete mess and I came out feeling short changed by them making me late to the interview which ofcourse threw me off a little. For a charity, I really did not get a good vibe or that they care very much about staff. It is really sad to treat potential employees this way particularly when the job market is harder than usual during the pandemic. From other Glassdoor reviews it seems clear ghosting is common for them and they're not particularly good with potential hires. So I hope if this happens to you, atleast know not to take it personally.

They told me I would get the answer after 2 weeks. \r\n\r\n4. After interview, I made a phone call to HR Officer to thank him for selecting me for the interview (regardless of the location gaffe) and I tried to use the opportunity to find out how I did. He told me that I did very well. \r\n\r\n5. Two weeks passed without being contacted so I called the HR Officer only to find out the he was on leave without any prior notifications to us. \r\n\r\n6. Again, when I asked the HR Officer whether I should be hopeful or prepare for the worst - as I had another job waiting for my answer -, he said I should be hopeful which made me turn down the job cause I felt I would get the job & I wanted to work for WWF. \r\n\r\n7. After returning from leave there was no correspondence until I rang him after a week had passed. He said he would call me back in 20 minutes which turned into an hour and I was forced to send him a message to remind him & I got a reply \u201cwe are moving buildings\u201d That was on Friday. \r\n\r\n8. The following Wednesday I couldn\u2019t wait anymore. I called and asked him point black if I got it or not and he acted as if he didn\u2019t know and said he would need to check the \u201cfile\u201d. Then he text messaged me \u201cSorry you were not successful\u201d and he defended himself when I told him they should have told me way before so I could make other plans, by  saying he was on leave and didn\u2019t know. \r\n\r\n9. He was not sending an email and so I had to ask him to write me a formal rejection email and he wrote one saying \u201cwe have gone with other CANDIDATES\u201d although the position was only for one candidate. \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is, HR Team of WWF Tanzania is extremely unprofessional and I am unhappy with the way they have handled my case especially after turning another good job that I could have taken.

I was notified of the interview two weeks before the interview date, but wasn't told the outcome of the interview until a week after the interview had taken place. From the initial application deadline to being told I was not  being taken to the second round of interviews took around 42 days.

All the questions were very specific and wanted to get straight to the heart of my experience, and exactly what relevant experience I had, and how I had gone about it. They wanted clear examples of relevant experience, and wanted to find out my understanding of how things (i.e. project management or stakeholder negotiation) should be done. There didn't seem to be much room for talking about other skills and experience, or trying to elaborate on why I could be best for the job. This is the part I found difficult - I was quizzed in some detail about very specific experience, but there was little room to 'show off' in other areas or tell them about other things I had done or achieved, or additional skills I had. I also had to do a 5 minute (pre-prepared) presentation. The topic, set by WWF, was the impacts of trophy hunting on wildlife conservation. As this was a Technical Adviser role (which would involve giving expert wildlife conservation advice) , candidates were expected to have a strong knowledge of conservation science, hence the technical nature of the presentation.\r\n\r\nMy experience may not be typical of WWF interviews for other job roles - I suppose different interview panels ask different questions, so an interview for an HR or Communications position would likely be completely different.", "Interview Questions": "What made you interested in this job and working for WWF?\r\n\r\nDescribe a project you have managed, and detail how you managed the budget and planned/ implemented the project.\r\n\r\nDescribe a situation where you have solved a problem.\r\n\r\nDescribe your experience of engaging with the media.\r\n\r\nIf you were approached to give comment on something you are unfamiliar with, how would you respond?\r\n\r\nDescribe how you have worked through issues with stakeholders.
