Also know that Freeman's minimum wage is $15 an hour - do you perform skilled work, have certifications, or are educated? Because you probably deserve more than that! I applied and received a text from a recruiter to set up an interview shortly after. The interview was pretty standard, the director was pleasant enough, though I was asked to shadow some current dialysis techs for 30 to 45 minutes which I was not expecting. Still an interesting experience. I got a call from the recruiter while I was at work, by the time I was off it was late. I had to go in very early next morning so was working again when I got a text to call him back. I called him on lunch and heard nothing until I texted him the following afternoon that I left him a voice mail. He said he would call in a few minutes and promptly called an hour later. Normally I would be salty about this, but I just find it hilarious because dealing with this guy was a complete circus. He called and discussed wages last - offered $15 an hour. By the way, that is Freeman's MINIMUM wage, so I would be getting paid as much as a receptionist or housekeeper to perform skilled work in a specialized area that requires a year of training to become proficient. I countered and was told that that was all they could offer, but got a text literally two minutes after ending the call offering 45 cents more. Like... which is it, your facility is in dire need to save 45 cents or not? Note that this is after the director told me the minimum wage AND expressed that they hoped I would be making more than that. For $15 I could go work at Target or Walmart and not have to bear the responsibility that comes with working in healthcare. Or, I could work as an HR recruiter and probably earn a few more peanuts. So yeah - know your worth. A job being posted and unfilled for over a month is also probably a red flag.", "Interview Questions": "How do you feel about occasional projectile blood sprays?"}, {"date": "30 Oct 2022", "title": "Social Worker Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Freeman Health System", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview process was fairly easy with several DBI/PAR questions.

One of them answered his phone twice - I imagine if this had been me, I would have been thrown in the reject pile immediately. The other interviewer and I had a nice interview with him gone, so I guess that's something. The job posting was also incorrect - it was listed as a PRN position, and the interviewers got irritated when I brought that up. They quickly said it was full time, not PRN, and I was also expected to take call.\n\nI thought the experience and pay would be better than my job at the time so I agreed to shadow. Honestly, everyone outside of HR seemed tired and miserable, like they hated their lives. I've worked in several area hospitals and have never seen people act the way they did at Freeman. I don't believe this is just this department or a COVID issue either - I noticed this same general attitude almost 5 years ago at an internship in another Freeman department. This is a cultural issue with Freeman in my opinion.\n\nAfter the interview and shadow experience I withdrew my application and applied elsewhere. Overall not a great experience. If the right position for the right pay opened I might be tempted to apply and work there, but that's only because I have a good reputation at other hospitals and know I would be hired back fast if things didn't work out.", "Interview Questions": "How would your coworkers describe you?"}, {"date": "25 Jan 2018", "title": "Care Support Aid Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 week.\u00a0I interviewed at Freeman Health System (Joplin, MO) in Nov 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "I filled out an application online and was emailed by HR asking to set up an interview.
