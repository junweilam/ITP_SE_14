On the surface, company seems very interesting and an agent of change to the current healthcare landscape. Had an interview with the hiring manager within a week, was only given a MS Teams link (no name((s)) of the people attending the interview. Turned out to be more than one person on the MS Teams meeting... overall meeting was positive, but they were very rushed and had a hard stop at 30 minutes... was asked to have a follow up call about a week later (set up through hiring manager, not HR). Second meeting was awkward and strange... seemed to me like it was a repeat of the first interview (despite the hiring manager \"looking at my notes\" from the previous interview. Pretty much asked the exact same questions (and follow up questions) as the first, rushed interview.... was abruptly cut short (which was fine with me) and absolutely no follow up.

Took them 3 weeks to get back to me. Around 1-2 weeks between interview stages. Strange interview experience. The HR interview was pretty standard. It was encouraging to hear how the company promotes a \"people first. work environment.\" For the second interview, the panel showed up 10 min late to a 30-minute interview, which is understandable as people are hopping from previous meetings. However, the interview panel clearly felt rushed on time, as the interview felt like a line of questioning more than a conversation. No time for pleasantries. Can you do these things, \"Yes/no?\" There were no cameras used from their side, but I needed to be on camera. It made the whole thing super awkward. When I asked to elaborate, they were more interested in the products my last company sold and how they sold them rather than my skills from that job, and it felt like they were using the time to scope out the competition.
