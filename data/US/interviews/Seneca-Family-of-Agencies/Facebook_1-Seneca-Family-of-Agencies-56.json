The interview started off with the male recruiter elaborating about Seneca, then asked us hypothetical and personal questions about ourselves. We were given the opportunity to answer or not. However, it is obvious that it is in your best interest to answer. This is where the competition came in because you felt like you had to out answer your opponent.

This time, the process was almost exactly the same but I didn't get an offer! The first interview is a group interview with someone from HR. It's uncomfortable because everyone has to answer the same questions in succession and everyone basically said the same thing. The HR guy just read questions off of a piece of paper and didn't respond to (or even acknowledge) anyone's answers. It seemed impersonal and not a good way to screen people. My second interview took weeks to schedule because the assistant who was scheduling them kept getting the interviewers' availability wrong and had to reschedule with me 4 or 5 times. The second interview was with the two supervisors I'd be working with if I got hired. They were late and neither one was very friendly. They seemed inexperienced with interviewing. I'd expect social workers to be a bit warmer and better at putting people at ease. They told me they only had my resume from 2011 and then asked really basic questions that (again) they read off their pieces of paper. It wasn't conversational at all and I couldn't wait to leave. One of them was incessantly yawning the whole time which I thought was really unprofessional and rude. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, everyone at this agency seems really young and inexperienced. This might be a good job for someone straight out of college but I have a lot more experience than the job required and still wasn't offered a job, even though I was offered it 5 years ago.

We scheduled things, and it all went pretty smoothly. A week later, I drove to San Leandro, walked into the front office, and waited for the Director to show up. The wait time was good; it only lasted a few minutes. I was then greeted by the Director, and we walked over to where her office was. The overall interview process was pretty standard, but there was one thing that went wrong: Mid-conversation, she stopped us so that she could text/ send an email/ whatever on her phone. I then proceeded to sit there in awkward, uncomfortable silence, for at least 5 minutes. I know that 5 minutes isn't very long in the big picture. HOWEVER. As an interviewer, you must know that the interviewee is already extremely nervous and receptive of any signals you are giving them. So, to the interviewee, 5 minutes feels MUCH longer than it really is. And pulling such a rude stunt in the middle of an interview shows that you do not have respect for the person who is showing interest in working for you and your company. I have never been in this kind of situation before. \r\n\r\nAnyways, after that happened, we continued with the interview. The Director seemed extremely terse and distant, which also was a bad sign for me. In the end, she started seeming less and less interested in what we were doing, like she had somewhere better to be. When I asked her my questions that I had for her, she gave me very short and sometimes unhelpful answers. I know that she is a busy woman, and the fact that she was giving me such a bad vibe was just a standard, tell-tale sign that I was not the right candidate. My only problem is, however, that she seemed disinterested right from the get-go. If you already knew that I wasn't a good fit for this position, why did you even bother to interview me in the first place? So much time, gas money, effort, and stress could have been spared if you did us both the favor of not reaching out to me in the first place. Since you did do so, at least give me the basic respect that professionals give to each other.\r\n\r\nOne more thing: At the end of our interview, the Director told me that they would get back to me with a decision within the next week. It had been more than two weeks until they got back to me. I understand that you are extremely busy and that interviewing may not be the top priority right now. But don't say things that you don't mean. Even a \"We honestly don't know when we'll get back to you\" would have been better, because then I wouldn't be confused and concerned when one week goes by and I don't even get an update email.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you interested in working for Seneca?"}, {"date": "23 May 2016", "title": "Health Information Specialist Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Seneca Family of Agencies (Oakland, CA)", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied online, they gave me a call within the next week, and I started out with a group interview.

I got a sense during both interviews that they already had someone in mind for the job from the little things that they said, so when I was notified that I didn't get the position I wasn't surprised. Overall, I had a pretty positive experience.

First I attended a group interview with about 10 other people. Seneca kindly tries to lessen the pressure by pooling interviewees who are not necessarily interested in the same positions or locations. The interview did feel less competitive and nerve-wracking this way, but it was still awkward at moments. It's discussion based, so prepare yourself to jump in and formulate original answers to a question 10 people have just answered. It seemed pretty clear to me that the group interview's purpose is to find out how well you can listen to, talk with and work with others. Almost all of the open positions were described as very team-oriented. \r\n\r\nThe second interview was a 1 on 1 with a program supervisor. This experience was completely fine. My interviewer was a little late, but they asked fair questions and gave time for me to ask questions and pick their brain about the job. They even asked some repeat questions from the group interview. It would be a good idea to prepare a list of emotional/behavioral signs that indicate a struggling child in advance. The program supervisor then set me up for the third and final interview, which is an interactive at one of their school sites.\r\n\r\nThis is where things got odd for me, and I suspect it's probably why I didn't get an offer. If you get to this point, you will be expected to head over to one of Seneca's schools where you will observe a Classroom Counselor, and they will in turn observe you as you interact/don't interact with the children. They will then report back to the program supervisor and supposedly give their opinion of you. \r\n\r\nThis experience was the worst part of the process for me. My host was, honestly, quite rude the entire length of the procedure. They spoke to me, maybe, a total of three minutes out of the entire hour and a half interview. At the time, I brushed it off as them maintaining a sense of objectivity. I carried on and tried my best to interact with the kids while maintaining a sense of boundary. They gave no notice of interview time frames, no feedback or thoughts about my performance and no chance to ask ask about their job. I get the sense they were pretty annoyed that I was interrupting their day (understandable). If you have to do an interactive interview, I'd say be more assertive than I was about interacting with your host so you can better understand how they think a Classroom Counselor should act/carry out their job. I think I may have faired better if I'd tried to match my host's style of interacting with children in the classroom.\r\n\r\nFinal opinion, the strangest aspect of this interview process was being expected to interact with children who don't know you and won't continue to see you. Seneca seems to pride itself on building strong bonds with young people, but they think it's okay to send in random, transient strangers for the sole purpose of an interview. I didn't trust that my interactive host really took the time to assess how well I would have done the job. Even after asking for feedback twice, I was not given any. And, the process really just took way too long. I waited 3-4 weeks between each interview before I got responses.", "Interview Questions": "Describe a time you disagreed with your supervisor.

After answering an insane amount of questions and completing a case study, I was asked for a 2nd interview and was then hired.

Sometime in late February of 2013, I applied online via Craigslist on a Monday or something. I received a phone call from HR later that week (Wednesday or Thursday) for what felt like a brief and informal phone interview as well as to schedule an appointment for a group interview at their main office in Oakland, California. I went to the group interview the following Monday. There were several candidates present who applied for various positions in different Seneca programs. I approached the group interview non-competitively, which I think HR valued. HR would ask the group a question and it's up to you to respond. HR may follow up to see if anyone else has anything else to say before moving on to the next question, but it's better if you take the initiative and/or build off of each other. After I completed the group interview, HR requested to complete additional information such as professional references, etc. I received a call a few days later and was informed that I moved onto 1:1 interviews at the program-specific location. We scheduled the first of two 1:1 interviews in the beginning of the next week. I was interviewed (though the person was not physically present--I was in a conference room and the interviewer Skyped). Either before or after the first interview, the program assistant provides you with a written prompt. I received a phone call shortly after (a day or two) to schedule another 1:1 interview with my direct supervisor later that week. That interview formerly lasted about 5 minutes before he offered me the job and then we informally talked for the next half hour or so.
