Then they went dark again for another 2 or 2.5 weeks, so I thought I wasn't going further in the process. Out of no where, I was called for an in-person interview -- I was excited because I thought I didn't get the role since they hadn't communicated with me in two weeks. They flew me out there and back the same day for the in-person; they also told me they would reimburse my expenses i.e. taxi and food. I was told in the office that I would be notified within the next week or two, either way -- whether I was hired or not. I followed up two weeks later because I didn't hear anything, neither yay or nay, about my in-person interview; and I also needed to submit my expense receipts. In this follow up, I emailed my expense receipts and was told they couldn't take them by email, I needed to send the originals in the mail --- which I don't understand why a copy would not suffice -- for example, the Uber receipt was via email, so this really didn't make sense. Well, I followed up and was told they were still making their decision and they were sorry for the wait and asked me to just sit tight for them and they would be getting back to me. Well... two more weeks passed, nothing. It's not been 1.5 months since my in-person interview and CLEARLY I did not get the role, which is fine, but to this day, I have not been notified one way or the other. They made it seem like my in-person interview was just a formality to meet the team, as if I was already hired because I had already interviewed with everyone on the phone (minus the CEO, I met him in person only). I left my job, hired a realtor to help with relocating, since it was explained as just coming to meet the team -- but I heard nothing about whether or not I was hired -- not a pin drop. I appreciate what this organization has done over the years for children, but I would never ever work with them due to how unprofessional this experience was. Not to mention, I was told in the interview that they don't really hire from within, so my development and growth would be up to me. If you say you are going to let a candidate know either way, then actually do that -- especially a candidate that has reached the final interview stage and was flown out.\r\n\r\n***Update: Hmmm... funny thing, the day after I write this review, which is MORE THAN 1.5 MONTHS AFTER MY IN-PERSON where I was told I would get a phone call within 1-2 weeks max, regardless of the outcome ---- I guess they check their Glassdoor regularly lol because now, one day after writing this review, they sent me an automated letter stating the went with a different candidate.
