Came in and at 12pm was told that that this was the second part o the interview they are interviewing 5 applicants and will call with a decision on Friday after I literally worked and called prospective clients. I asked the Owner's wife (co-partner) why didn't she be honest with me up front. They had me in a room making  call after call like a telemarketer  and I was going to be doing a regular admissions cold calling position apparently which I have no interest in. I would not have done any of that for two hours free, scheduling three of their prospective students.  She agreed to pay me which was $12 short of what I was agreed to be paid for salary and the she said..well the decision has not been made yet let me go and get your materials and then you can finish the calls and I can decide on rather I'll hire you. I made one call and then realized she was just trying to make we work longer to recoop that $20 she paid.
