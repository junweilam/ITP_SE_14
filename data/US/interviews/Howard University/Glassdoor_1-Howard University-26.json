Did a skype interview and surprisingly, the next day they invited me to an on-campus interview. Right of the bat, they proved to be disorganized and unprofessional.  Communication was minimal. I had to ask repeatedly for an agenda for the interview. All I got was a screenshot of a message sent by the search committee chair asking the staff about room availability! Nonetheless, I took one of my presentations with me to play it safe. On the day of the interview, the staff was confused/misinformed about the start time. They had me come in over an hour earlier but the faculty seemed to go with the flow and we got started right away. The most remarkable thing was the repetition of the questions from the original skype interview. We basically had the same conversation twice! Off course they expected me to do a presentation as well! Unlike other institutions I have interviewed, there was no tour of the facilities, no offer to go to lunch or drop off at the airport. Not that I expect to be fed or transported but it shows professionalism. Anyway, all this is minor compared to the real reason I am giving Howard a negative review. it is solely because I have not heard one word from them in almost 5  months! Not a 'thank you for coming in' , or the standard, 'thanks but we went in a different direction' email. I on the other hand, thanked them individually for inviting me to campus. Not only that, I have written, multiple times, several of the people involved asking for an updated. No response as of this posting. Now, many schools don't update you after receiving and rejecting a cv; few even don't update you after the initial video/phone interview but I have never, not received, at least an email after an on-campus, 2nd round interview.
