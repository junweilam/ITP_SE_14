Then was given only 5 min (at most) to ask them questions. I was never given a clear answer as to which unit I was being interviewed for and there was not a unit manager present. I also learned that although you are guaranteed full-time benefits, the position itself was not full-time. After orientation you have to apply to the unit (again?) and then they tell you how many hours they can give you, with the minimum of being 20-24-ish.
