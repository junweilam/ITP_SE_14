After submitting an application, if selected to move onto the next round, you would receive an email requesting a video interview that was comprised of a couple of questions. This video interview is meant to replace phone interviews, and weed out weaker candidates from stronger ones that would fit well within the system. The video interview was fairly simple, and allowed for candidates to rerecord their answers as many times as they desired. Questions should be answered in under two minutes each. After completing the video interview, within a couple weeks if selected to move onto the final round, candidates would be invited to attend an in person panel interview with the head's of all the hiring departments. Candidates who have been selected will be notified shortly after all interviews have been concluded. As soon as the candidate receives an job offer over the phone, the candidate will begin to receive a slew of emails detailing the onboarding/hiring process.  The hiring process involves (aside from filling out paperwork online) going in person to the employee health clinic for a physical, blood draw, and drug screen. The future employee will also be asked to visit corporate headquarters to sign the contract, get their picture taken for their ID, and receive a parking decal for parking on hospital grounds.", "Interview Questions": "Most of the questions they asked me during my interview were related to my volunteer experience at the hospital, my experience on the oncology floor I did my practicum on, and specific details that I had on my resume.  \r\nThe questions weren't difficult, they mainly just want to get to know you. Even if you do get a tough question, keep your cool, its okay to take a minute to process it and come up with an eloquent answer instead of answering right away with word vomit. \r\nMake sure to show them your smile, make sure your answers are personal and unique - work in personal experiences and tell a story with your answer instead of just giving a generic response. For example, if they ask \"why pedatrics\", instead of saying \"I love kids\", tell them a story of a time when you really enjoyed teaching/spending time with a child, make it personable. They WILL remember stories, and you want to stand out from the crowd. I cannot stress this enough,  NO GENERIC ANSWERS.\r\nPrepare beforehand, look up nursing interview questions but don't just prepare for those. Think out of the box. Because this interview was for a new grad position, they know that you don't have much floor experience so they're not going to ask you random, out of the blue questions that a more seasoned nurse will be asked, but do prepare for situational questions such as \"what would you do if xyz happened, how would you react, what would be your next step?\".  \r\nLastly, do your research about the company and work in their mission and vision into your answers! They want to know that you'll fit in well with the culture they are cultivating on campus. I had a friend who was asked why she wanted to work at NCH and she gave the most generic answer instead of working in how different the hospital is from other hospitals, and the distinct services they have to offer to their patients and their families.\r\nDo your homework!"}, {"date": "30 Jan 2018", "title": "Registrar Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Nicklaus Children's Health System (Miami, FL) in Oct 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "Basic questions, \"why would you like to work with us?\" \"tell us about a time you had a conflict with a customer and how did you handle it?\" I dressed with business attire, the interview described the role of the position, pay, benefits and what's expected as a new hire.", "Interview Questions": "\"Tell me about yourself\""}, {"date": "5 Jan 2018", "title": "Senior Supply Chain Analyst Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Nicklaus Children's Health System (Miami, FL) in Oct 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "A panel of 6-8 people asking questions about your experience and situational questions regarding office eitiquette.
