I met with 4 individuals over 4 hours, some of whom were not even present (I had to go into SGK just to Skype with them). None of the interviewers were able to articulate what the position was, what their positions were, or what SGK actually does. One of the interviewers (the director) was also unable to understand basic terms in the field, yet spoke to me as if I were an idiot. She was also incredibly hostile when I asked how SGK collects data from individuals with breast cancer, survivors, or providers about their experiences. She actually stared me right in the eye and told me their perspectives don't matter to SGK's development! I find that deeply disturbing, and suspect others looking to work in a public health field would agree. Another interviewer almost cried talking about how confused she was with her work. I also found many of the interviewers to be rude to the administrative assistant in the office, which did not reflect well on company culture. Moreover, after the interviews were complete, I got the impression that the job description was a way to entice an applied data analyst into an administrative, clerical position.  I would not at all suggest this process to anyone who cares about how data are used in practice.  I'll also add that the process was quite slow, and it was hard to get emails in a timely manner.
