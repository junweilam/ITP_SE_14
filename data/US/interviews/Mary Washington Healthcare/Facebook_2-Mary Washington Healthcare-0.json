It obviously made them feel uncomfortable that I have a higher degree, more experience, and am somehow younger than them.  Never thought  being an over achiever would be a bad  thing. Thehiring manager acted as if I had the job, disclosing some very personal details. To top it off, I was assured I'd be reimbursed for the travel expenses (plane, car rental) and basically had to beg HR for the reimbursement. Over 2 months went by before I received the check...
