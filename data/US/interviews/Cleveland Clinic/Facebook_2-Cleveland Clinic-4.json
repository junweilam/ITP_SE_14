I would not call it a process as it was disorganized and confusing. For this particular position, I was able to bypass the on-demand video interview since I completed this step for a previous job application. I received an email to schedule an in-person interview with the Clerical Manager. I was able to get in the next day, which was nice. I met with her and a team lead. The interview consisted only of five scenario-based questions. I was never asked why I applied for the job, why I want to work at Cleveland Clinic, or anything regarding my work history/experience in health care, which I found odd. The last part of the interview consisted of a 30-45 minute shadowing experience. I sat with somebody in this role and was able to learn what the job entails and ask questions. I was also given a short tour. I thought this was really interesting and enjoyed it. I left feeling excited about this opportunity. Fast forward to a week later, I received and email from a recruiter I never talked to before to set up a call about my interview. I spoke with the recruiter on the phone and was offered the position. I was very excited until he started going over details about pay, which had not been discussed before. I figured if they wanted to move forward with me, they would have me do another interview, where I would ask more detailed questions about pay, benefits, etc. I was completely blindsided by the pay being offered (19.50/hour). I asked if there was any flexibility and he responded in a very positive way, making it seem as if this would be no issue. He stated he needed to reach out to the compensation department to see if they could approve me for the pay I wanted, which was $2 more per hour. I got off the phone call feeling hopeful and looking forward to hearing back within a couple days. I received an email about 3 business days later with the news that they were unable to approve anything more than the offered amount. I was extremely disappointed that they could not spare as little as fifty cents more an hour for a well-qualified candidate who was extremely interested in the position. For background, I have a Bachelor of Science, as well as a Master of Health Administration with almost 10 years of total health care experience. This felt like a slap in the face and made me feel undervalued. I responded by politely declining with a short explanation as to why this will not work for me. I received no response.

It was a question and answer interview and you submitted your recorded answers through the app.  I was selected for an interview which was panel style. The interview went well and I was asked to come back for a second interview. My second interview was a teleconference because it took place during the Covid-19 stay-at-home mandate. The call consisted of the subject matter experts. Telephone interviews are tough because it\u2019s hard to let your personality show through. After the interview, I was asked to submit 5 reference via an online service, SkillSurvey. This is the part I was unhappy with. The references were asked to completed an online survey about you which was pretty lengthy, it was at least 20 questions and it even included written answers to explain strengths and weaknesses.  I had to have 2 manager reviews and the rest could be any other coworkers.  This was frustrating because I had to follow up with one of my managerial references several times for her to complete the survey. After all the hounding of references and jumping through hoops, I didn\u2019t get the job! I was so humiliated that I didn\u2019t get the position and had to tell my references I was turned down and they wasted their time completing such a lengthy survey.  Once asked for references, I thought I was going to get an offer. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t get the job, HR didn\u2019t offer any feedback and I\u2019m wondering if it was something said by a reference.

I had to download the interview app called Hire Vue, which is an app that asks you interview questions with multiple choice answers and also prompts you with open-ended questions, giving you 30 seconds to think about your responses before automatically video recording your answer (you're given 3 minutes to answer - if you finish before the 3 minutes is up you can end that particular recording). The app does give you unlimited times to record practice answers to their practice questions. \r\n\r\nThe \"interview\" is you talking to yourself via your camera on your phone or computer. Once you're finished, the app sends your \"interview\" to the Cleveland Clinic (or wherever - who really knows).\r\n\r\nMaybe a week after my \"interview\" I received another email asking me to take a typing assessment for the job. I had 3 minutes to type a long passage of mostly nonsensical information with quite a few quotation marks, parentheses, numbers, etc. thrown in. I should have warmed up first, because my typing was definitely slower in the beginning than toward the end. Also, all the extra characters in the text threw me off my game. \r\n\r\nApparently I didn't pass their assessment, because after a few weeks of crickets from them I got curious and logged into my Work Day account. When I clicked on my application it simply said \"Not Selected.\" \r\n\r\nSo that's it. The whole application / interview process (up to the point where I was eliminated from of the pool of candidates) is 100% online and automated and 100% impersonal. My husband commented that the Cleveland Clinic appears to treat job applicants and the process like a \"meat market.\" A former colleague of mine who had previously worked for the Cleveland Clinic said he didn't like it because he was \"just a number.\"\r\n\r\nI was pretty put off by the whole thing. I mean, I basically interviewed myself, and they didn't even have the courtesy to program an automated rejection email into their process. \r\nThis job wasn't even in my top 3 desirable jobs, so to be so carelessly rejected and cast aside is a bit of an insult.

About a week later, I was contacted by HR, who asked routine questions regarding the position, as well as several behavioral questions. I was brought in for an interview with the director and manager of digital marketing. \r\n\r\nThe interview focused on the technical components of the job, and was heavy on background experience, with a focus teamwork. There were several behavioral questions peppered into the fray as well. Overall, they were nice: one stiff and calculated, the other jovial and forthcoming. \r\n\r\nWhen I asked about the position, both struggled to coherently sum up its duty within in 60 seconds.  \r\n\r\nI was called for a second - final - interview with a panel that consisted of fancy titles. They required I submit 5 references in advance, two of which had to be former managers. If you haven't yet experienced the joy of working with the SkillShare system, buckle up. \r\n\r\nThe second interview focused on background experiences. Each panel member asked questions related to their specific field. Some of the questions included classics such as \"tell me about a time,\" or \"how would you say you.\" Overall, not bad. \r\n\r\nWhat I found incredibly eye opening was how the marketing account services director explained to the panel that a rock star for the position is someone that thrives in the gray area. This was in response to my question regarding the role and how it interfaces with various departments. \r\n\r\nCould be my rigidity and lack of experience working in cross-functional teams nixed me. \r\n\r\nEither way, I hope this helps the next person who applies for the role. Don't fret about technical PPC aspects too much. They work with an agency who manages the campaigns and turns the dials. They also have an in-house data science team. \r\n\r\nFocus more on your experiences using the STAR approach. Answer before they ask. \r\n\r\nSadly, HR did not have the courtesy to notify me of a decision, even after I reached out to the formerly responsive individual in HR. \r\n\r\nThis speaks volumes about their hiring practices. Anyone can talk a big game, but true communication fell through at this critical junction. I was just another number in a game where speed matters most. Churn and burn. \r\n\r\nFinalists spent a lot of time reaching out and gathering references, taking time out of their day, preparing and writing follow up notes. Such as shame. \r\n\r\nTo the next lucky candidate - scratch the thank you notes and traditional hokus-pokus. I'm guessing they have a rigid policy.

I felt the first interviewer was somewhat of a jerk and either didn't want to be there, or felt I wasn't qualified enough as his tone was one of arrogance.  The next person was a manager and he was a great guy who asked straight forward questions and very personable.  That was followed by two individuals from a Service Desk (Director, Ind. Cont.).  The Director was great (funny and fully of energy), her counterpart was no-so-much.  He was definitely more 'short' with his questions and did not smile much.  My final interview was with the hiring Director.  It went well; however, it seems their organization is too busy trying build a rigid process to fit their problems using non-technical help, instead of hiring some technical people to help design a more flexible one ... one that works.  To me, it appeared they can't see the forest through the proverbial trees.  When I left, I knew I was not a good fit.  This particular organization has some issues and quite honestly, I didn't want to be any part of it.

I wanted to further put to use everything that I had learned within my healthcare major. Over the past couple of months I have applied to 92 jobs at Cleveland Clinic. Of those 92 applications I have  only had two phone interviews (the first stage). The first phone interview was for a patient service presentative position. During this \"interview\" we only went over what is stated on the application. While I tried to answer the questions, the interviewer continued to talk over me by saying \"oh that's great,\" \"uh huh,\" before I could even finish the statement. By her just doing that I knew that I was not going to get the job. When the interview was over, she said that everything was great and that she was sending everything over to the hiring manager. That Friday, I received an email informing me that I was not selected and that \"at this time, have made the decision to pursue other candidates.\" I called back to speak with someone in Human Resources and was told to just be persistent and continue to apply to jobs as soon as they are posted. About 3 weeks later, I received an email to set up a phone interview for a Laboratory Technician position. This phone interview went a lot more smoother as the lady listened to me as she entered the information onto her computer as we spoke. The only difference between this interview and the last was that the interviewer asked me two questions pertaining to conflict resolutions in my past work experience. I answered them perfectly fine and she told me that she would be forwarding my information to the hiring manager. That Friday, I received the same automated rejection/denial email. I do not understand how I am not getting past the first stage in the hiring process, but I am not applying to any other positions here as my goal/aspirations to work here are completely depleted.

Social media -- better have a squeaky clean history if you want a job here.  Integrity is the name of the game.  Once you are invited for an interview on-site the process may move quickly depending upon how many other candidates are interviewing and where you are in the line-up and then it will slow again before you'll hear news as they check out your references and your background check.  It is an intense selection process -- not for the faint of heart or anyone in a hurry.  They are discerning and you'll know it by the process!  Zero information about salary range or benefits until an offer is made so you go with the flow and then assess the package when you get an offer  -- apparently this is the CCF way of doing things.  A bit of going with the flow in blind faith that the compensation package will match your expectations and your needs. You'll feel you've earned an offer if you get one!

I sent a packet which included my CV and a presentation outlining my accomplishments in health care management. Initial communication from the hospital came through the secretary of the VP of operations.  My first interview was with the VP of operations who was also in charge of all ancillary services.  She asked me a series of question regarding my experience in the field and in managment.  She also asked me some questions based on scenarios that had occurred regarding employee relations.  The department was experiencing staffing shortages as well as no department director and I from her description, I could only imagine the tension and their frustration. I was asked about my goals and where I envisioned myself 5 years from now.  The VP took me on a tour of the hospital and then took me back to her office where she asked if I could come back the next day to be intereview by some of the doctors.  I came back the following day and was interviewed by the 2 pulmonologists whom I already knew from a previous supervisory position at the hospital. There were really no in-depth interview questions except to ask how I was doing over the last few years and to confirm my thoughts that the department was in turmoil and needed additional guidance.  I was supposed to have an interview with the cardiopulmonary staff so they could \"check me out\" and see if I was someone they could relate to for their issues.  Due to the heavy patient load and no time, I was asked to come back again 2 days later for the staff interview.  The staff interview was interesting in that I knew a couple of the therapists already and felt comfortable with the questions that I was being asked.  My confidence was high, and it showed in my answers and the staff reactions.  I was even put \"on the spot\" by ome particular staff member who challenged me with questions about disciplinary action.  All in all the interview felt very successful.
