In the second round, I had a brief \"get to know you\" panel interview with the team, and was asked to give a one-hour presentation to a group of students who were engaged in that program on campus. Afterward, I was taken to dinner with a group of those students as well as employees from the administration -- the table was perhaps 12 people. This was also a more relaxed \"get to know you\" session where I felt more like a participant than a subject of focus.\r\n\r\nI had a friend who pushed internally for me to get this job; he was on the interview committee. I didn't receive an offer and was told they were pausing filling the position. My friend informed me that I didn't get the job because the wife of the Director, who sat next to me at dinner, asked me what book I'm currently reading. I answered truthfully, that at that moment I was in between leisure books because I was helping a graduate professor with research and all of my reading time was spent in academic journals - of which I listed the titles and provided an overview of the research. She relayed to her husband that \"He doesn't find time to read\" and evidently that's not the kind of person they wanted in that position.\r\n\r\nPretty amazing.\r\n\r\nI kept tabs on the program over the next few months, and it's also true that they didn't hire an associate directly (rather they underfilled it with a more junior, entry-level person).", "Interview Questions": "Who was [the person that the program was named after]?

First there was a 10 minute phone \"screener\" interview with 4-5 people.  About a week later, they called back and requested a face-to-face interview.  The face-to-face interview was with 4 people.  They had three pages of questions typed out, and each person took turns going down the list, asking a question and taking notes.  For someone with interview anxiety, it was fairly stressful.   I will say that everyone was pretty friendly and thanked me after I answered each question, which I thought was nice.  After the interview, I was asked to take a 30-minute proofreading assessment and an assessment on Excel.   The assessments weren't very difficult, but there was not nearly enough time to complete the Excel assessment.  After over two weeks of not hearing anything, I followed up, and received a generic \"you did not get the position\" e-mail from HR the next day.  I found this to be a little disrespectful - I understand that there must have been a better candidate and I accept that, but after the time and effort I had put in to preparing for the interview, someone could have at least called me or written a more personable e-mail (especially since I had met with them face-to-face).  The hiring process here seems to take an extremely long time, so be prepared to wait a while if you want to get hired here.

You are going to put in a LOT more effort for these interviews than for a normal company, mostly because universities do everything, especially hiring, in committees of 10+ people. My specific tip for GVSU interviewees is this: answer with stereotypical answers. \"How would you improve the program\" --> more student involvement, alumni involvement, community involvement. This is more like Miss America than anything else. You need to show you have a personality yet not veer off the acceptable \"world peace\" track or you'll be scored negatively. Be prepared for personal life questions too and answer appropriately. They want academics so portray yourself as a future thought leader. Before your interview, find a book, movie, and musician that is a little off the beaten path but one that's highly regarded. Ex: don't say you read Orwell, say Kafka - or someone even more obscure. Find a classical or jazz musician and talk about how you like to unwind on your car rides or at home.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the questions are all pretty straightforward, if not boring and uninspired (What are your strengths?
