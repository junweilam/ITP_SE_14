First, I had to qualify for an interview time slot for a big hiring event by getting past the computer gatekeeper.  Candidates were being sent home left and right because the computer gatekeeper apparently let a lot of people through that didn\u2019t make the cut.  They were all sent home for not having one full year experience in a medical setting in the last 3 years. I even witnessed one who worked in a chemical dependency program  for 11 months who was told to come back in 30 days. Brutal! Then there  were a couple of weeks of waiting for background checks and such. NCH has this whole process down to a science and all of it was painlessly done online. \n\nThe only thing that really stood out was that every piece of paperwork indicated that the drug test would be a urinalysis, including the ones I signed that gave permission to legally collect my bodily fluid samples in the first place. However, they had me shove a sandpaper feeling sponge in my mouth and rub it around for 10 minutes to gather up some saliva instead, turning the inside of my mouth to ground meat in the process. The tech said, \u201cOh, yeah. We switched to saliva tests a couple of months ago.\u201d \n\nThis felt almost like a staged \u201cgotcha moment\u201d and did very little to instill trust in NCH as a potential employer. This stands especially true when you get into the organization and realize that NCH is meticulous about literally every minute detail and \u201cmistakes\u201d like outdated paperwork being distributed for months on end simply don\u2019t happen.

Took a simple math and logic test followed by a in person interview. There are several things I wish to warn potential applicants about when applying for jobs at Nationwide. First, do not trust the job description/and or requirements listed on any literature, they are highly inaccurate, and if used for research purposes will lead to you not being hired. For this position, Nationwide listed the requirements as being a high school graduate with some experience in hospital or mental health field, a bachelors degree candidate would be given preference. \r\n\r\nI am a 2nd year graduate student studying neuro and addiction psychology, and the interview questions presented were designed for someone who has been in the mental health field for many years, and if you only possessed a high school diploma (or even B.S.) you would probably have zero answers. In short, there is no possible way a high school graduate or B.S. degree holder would have any knowledge of processes and questions asked during interviews \r\n\r\nAnother tip: Nationwide will not hire anyone, or move forward in the hiring processes unless you have a minimum of 5...yes 5 professional references that have a valid email address in which they are willing to fill out a survey about you.
