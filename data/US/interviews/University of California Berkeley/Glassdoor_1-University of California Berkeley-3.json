Honestly, this was one of the smoother interview processes I have had but the reason it's negative is my experience with the HR department. I had been selected for the position with a start date and was over the moon until I was told by the UC Berkeley  HR that they do not sponsor employees. A lot of companies don't and that is okay, but for me to have gone through the entire process and then have this thrown at my face nonchalantly was very upsetting. What's more, I had to personally contact the senior HR person because the person I was talking to had absolutely no idea about anything. When you mention in your job post that you are an EOE did you not expect such applications? The lack of information, miscommunication and a completely apathetic response from the HR is what really upset me. What's more, I was told to 'withdraw' the application instead of them accepting that it's they who cannot employ me.
