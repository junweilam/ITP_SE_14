One of the teachers interviewing me smiled nicely the whole time. Two looked neutral, and one looked unhappy. They had a specific set of questions they would ask all applicants. Mostly questions about our teaching philosophy, how we would present certain topics, how we would handle different situations, the order we would present things in, group work, etc. You need to know current composition teaching beliefs, practices and pedagogy. Also, be expected to answer a question about what theorists influenced you the most and why (you can't go wrong with Paulo Freire and his critical pedagogy and Freirean teaching methods). You will also be asked to address the issue of second language learners in the composition classroom. Once the interview is done, you will hear back in 1-3 weeks about whether or not you were given the job. If you got the job, you will be given choices of class times to teach, and you will be expected to create your outline for the semester and your prompts, peer review forms and grading rubrics (4 prompts in total - basically your whole writing sequence). Everything else you create and plan as the semester progresses. I truly enjoyed working here.
