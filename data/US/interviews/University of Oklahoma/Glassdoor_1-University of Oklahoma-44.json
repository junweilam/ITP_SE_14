I was asked to prepare a presentation of my portfolio, but they seemed not to have enough time to be interested in that when I got there. \r\n\r\nAfter the interview, they asked me to perform an art test, which is odd, since my portfolio pretty much shows what I can do and art tests are typically used earlier in the process, well before interviews as a filter. It was a short test, and I submitted the results on time. I then heard nothing for weeks. \r\n\r\nI finally sent an email to the hiring manager who notified me they had already sent notice that they hired someone else... VIA SNAIL-MAIL... through the correspondence dept at a huge university! Are you kidding? All other communications were either by phone or email. The manager said they had immediately sent out the mail, but after receiving the letter, I checked the post mark and noted that it was post-marked ten days after he said it was mailed. Good grief.
