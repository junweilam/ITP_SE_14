Hiring manager followed up requesting to set times with each of the team members, and for the initial phone screen. 2 weeks later had an international Skype interview, which was pleasant overall and just gave a general background on the team. The second Skype interview, however, was THE WORST INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. The interviewer got offended when I asked about projects they would like to see in the future in the department, saying that they \"didn't have a fiefdom\" and it wasn't up to them to decide what came next. It completely rattled me that the answer was so aggressive and unprofessional after a completely standard question, and it was hard to bounce back after that. I got the overall sense that the interview was interfering with something more important. After the interview I searched for company reviews and was shocked to see the word \"fiefdom\" come up. I have never heard this word used in passing, so this must be a term that is used often in the office -- and this is not a good sign. Needless to say, I was quite worried moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe third interview went off without a hitch, just the standard interview questions that I was asked in the first Skype interview. The fourth Skype interviewer no-showed, and when I followed up with the hiring manager they said it would not be rescheduled (and I was never offered an explanation or apology). Then a week later they followed up to reschedule the interview with the fourth interviewer (who was actually quite friendly in the end). The last interview was in the Rockefeller offices with the first interviewer, and I was given a tour of the offices. I was not notified of the final decision until months after the date I was told in the last interview. I have always wanted to work at RF, but this experience has completely turned me off from ever applying again. \r\n\r\nI completely agree with a previous interview review: The immediate demands of the position were not clear from the job description, and they were never fully explained during the interview process so it made it impossible to explain your added value to the team. Even after 5 interviews I was struggling to understand the role of the Associate in the team.\r\n\r\nAdvice for management: Multiple interviewers discussed Rockefeller Foundation's struggle to find legitimacy in an increasingly competitive non-profit space (with players like Gates and Clinton, both of which have much larger reaches/budgets). This needs to be figured out immediately, and a discussion needs to happen with senior management/anyone who interviews prospectives so that appropriate answers can be given. People are interviewing with you because they are looking for somewhere exciting to work, and because you have a century-old track record of doing important work. For an experienced interviewee looking for a solid next step, it is not reassuring to speak with team members who cannot tell you about future projects/plans. When you invest in new/junior staff, this is when you will truly succeed. Innovation is key. It is ok to have a tough interview process, but it should always be friendly and professional. The best and brightest are flocking to Gates and Clinton Foundations because they are doing both of these things. Also, hiring should not be outsourced -- your point of first contact should be impeccably professional and fully invested in building a positive workplace.", "Interview Questions": "Where do you see yourself in the next 10 years?"}], [{"date": "21 Jun 2015", "title": "Program Associate Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at The Rockefeller Foundation (Nairobi) in May 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "Shortlisted candidates were interviewed by a panel of three people.
