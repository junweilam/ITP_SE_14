My first in-person interview was with two Vice Presidents in the company on October 21, 2016. The interview went really well, I built a connection with my interviewers and was even given a tour of the facility after I had answered all of their questions. They told me numerous times that they were in a rush to fill the position during this interview.  I didn't hear anything back for two weeks so I called and asked for an update on the hiring process on November 4, 2016.\r\n\r\nI was called back on November 9, apologizing for the delay and was asked to come in for a second in-person interview on November 17. This second interview was a panel interview with four people from the company from every level plus a client from one of the programs I would be managing. This second interview went very well I felt, maybe even better than the first one. I answered all of their questions thoughtfully and insightful. I was also given a second tour of the program facility after the interviewed had ended where I got to see the program in action and meet several of the clients.\r\n\r\nI didn't hear anything back for weeks and asked for an update or if a decision had been made on 12/2/2016. I was contacted a full week later and said no update had been made and one would be made in the next week, they did not expect the process to take this long. I did not hear anything for one month after this call so I called and asked for yet another update and to just let me know either way if they had a hired for the position or if I was still a candidate. I still did not hear anything from the company until almost two months after the non-update update on 1/21/2017 where I got a non-personalized letter in the mail saying I was not qualified for the position. Throughout this whole process on the company's staff page there had been the Program Manager position listed with no staff picture. This was taken down one day before I got my letter in the mail. \r\n\r\nFor future job-seekers be weary of this organization. They dragged my interview process along for almost 5 months for a job I was extremely qualified for and interviewed in-person twice. They never even hired anybody for the position! The lack of communication during this process was appalling, disrespectful, and down-right rude. If a job-seeker is not qualified and or does poorly in the interview process that is one thing but for somebody who met all the qualifications, had a wealth of experiences, and did extremely well in the interviews to get a letter is pretty shameful. But a letter almost 3 months after their second interview saying that they are unqualified for a position that you didn't even hire for and giving them two in person interviews is just abhorrent.", "Interview Questions": "How would you handle a situation with a client who refuses to do their job?"}], [{"date": "30 Aug 2016", "title": "Caregiver Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Copa  Health (Flagstaff, AZ) in Jan 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "Staff was very straightforward, but inviting.
