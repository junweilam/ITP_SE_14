However, I was asked about my medical field experience and when I said I did not have any, the manager became even more irritated. This is all after she called me, after seeing my resume (with no medical experience) to set up an interview. Left the meeting feeling like a burden and glad to be done with it. She said I would hear in 1-2 weeks about the position, but it took 2 months to get an email saying they were going in a different direction. I don't think it's a bad company, just think that their hiring process needs some work. I drove over an hour to interview for a job that I apparently wasn't qualified for in the first place, and felt like I was being punished for it.
