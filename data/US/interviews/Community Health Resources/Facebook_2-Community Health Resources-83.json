Over and done with after barely 15 minutes. Kind of discriminatory too because of some of the questions they asked. One of the questions asked about my religious preference and whether I would need certain holidays scheduled off to observe. Another question asked about whether I would have a hard time \"taking orders from somebody who was much younger than you.\" Jeez!! Just come righout and say that you discriminate against candidates due to their religion and age. At least I'd have more respect for you for being upfront about the fact. Ironically, I did receive an offer before the week was over. But I followed my gut intuition and turned away the offer.

Leadership in human resources at CHR is so unbelievably disrespectful, I wouldn't even know where to begin! They were very dismissive and quick to rush me off the phone. A few weeks later, I was called a second time for the same position which I thought I definitely hadn't got the first time. Evidently there wasn't very much communication in the human resources department between which candidates (myself) had already been screened for which positions. Once I got to the on site part of the interview process, it wasn't very good either. My interviewers clearly had very little experience with interviewing candidates. Most of the questions had little to zero relevance to the position which I had applied for. Some of the questions were even kind of inappropriate in nature, since they both brought politics into the mix. Politics, religion, and other stuff shouldn't really be discussed in the workplace; definitely not during an initial job interview where you don't really know the candidates all that well. Later on, several weeks afterwards, I was finally given a third call back stating that another candidate had ultimately been selected for my first choice. However, they did extend an offer for a different position which I hadn't actually applied for. I declined the second offer since it wouldn't have been compatible with my schedule. By that time thankfully, I had already accepted an employment offer with a much more professional agency. So as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't really that much of a loss.", "Interview Questions": "Some of the questions focused on politics, what policies I supported et cetera.
