You should want your candidate to feel welcome and feel like this is a company that they would love to work for.  No wonder this institution can't keep employees!

I had heard very negative things through former employees, etc. about the lack of seriousness, it being just a tuition factory and there being no focus on student services or staff development, but I decided to form my own opinion. I still can't believe that such a public entity who already has a bad reputation is still doing nothing to improve that, seemingly both internally and externally. So now two months later and still nothing, I am counting my blessings that I never heard back as the is says everything about this so called \"university\" which is more of a real estate venture.", "Interview Questions": "Mostly just that the Recruiter didn't seem familiar with the position, international student services, visas, or the details of the department, so it what somewhat difficult to talk about my experience.

That was pretty brief, with an overview of some of my experience and of this position. She told me the pay is $13/hour, that night and weekend shifts are pretty much required, and that it's a position contracted for each semester. She asked if that was all okay, I said yes, and she set up an in-person interview with HR for me. That interview was pretty straight-forward, mainly reviewing my resume and me talking about my experience. I was told this interview would be just 30 minutes with her, but that went well so they sent me to another site to meet with the photo lab managers. Luckily I had free time that afternoon because the process unexpectedly took about 2 hours. The in-depth technical interview with the actual photo hiring managers was much more difficult and they had a lot of specific questions about my experience with equipment. Before we sat down for the interview, they showed me around the facilities and explained a lot of what I would be doing. They seemed pretty nice and I could tell it was going well. Toward the end they showed me the perks--a nice shirt and jacket uniform, a key card, and he said I would be getting health insurance, which makes sense because the job is full-time. The original woman I interviewed on the phone with called me back that afternoon to offer me the position and she also informed me, however, that the job does not include health benefits because it is \"part time.\" Although it's a minimum of 40 hours per week, you don't working for the entire period between semesters and need to be rehired, so they're able to label it part time.

I could hardly believe I found the ad there, but answered anyway.  They called me three times asking me to come out for a visit.  I was told I would be interviewed and that I was there \"first choice.\"  Weeks passed without any contact or offer of flying me out, until they called again and told me just to buy my own ticket and they would reimburse me.  I booked a cheap hotel (125$) for two nights in Oakland and the cheapest r/t flight I could find.  I printed my receipts.  \r\n\r\nWhen I got to San Francisco, I had been given the number of the President, by the Director who was in contact with me.  She never answered my calls when I called, nor did she return my calls.  This was not a good sign. So I inquired with the Director.  He seemed as frustrated as I was and called her and managed to set up a meeting between me and her at the Palace Hotel during lunch hour the next day.  She came to that meeting an hour late accompanied by her assistant , she is a sort of enforcer for the President.  The president was overly familiar, fake-friendly and under-curious about me, which always sets off bells.  But apparently I was hired.  She asked me where I was staying and I told her.  She had my hotel switched to a fancy one, but didn't offer to pay for the one I had already booked or my expensive flight.  She told me there was \"one more step\" in the hiring process and that was passing approval from her father. The following day I was to meet her and him at Trader Vic's for lunch.  We met there, and both arrived in black limos that had a sort of mobster dirty feel.  Hers said \"I (heart) art\" on the license plate.  The Father proved to be someone who dominates in conversation, interrupts, and tries to throw in the clever line just when you are getting serious about your answers.  He was pompous and down-talking.  I had brought along a small original noted piece of my expensive artwork.  It was of a famous black woman. He looked at it and immediately commented, \"Are you a communist?\" (with some self sniggering).  Awkward.  Apparently I was hired after this, but felt disgusted and unenthused about the owners of this school.  The process did not get any better after this.  I never got reimbursed for the hotel or flight until nearly 8 months later, even though the President paraded me around the 79 building telling everyone she \"flew me out here\" to interview.  She agreed to pay only half my moving expenses which amounted to $10k.  Those also never were paid until I had contacted the administration 4 times about it well into the second half of my first year on the job, which was nothing as she had described it in the interview.  She had described a job of creativity and teaching where I would teach at a high level with autonomy.  It was nothing like what was described.  No faculty had autonomy, and every aspect of classroom teaching was controlled from curriculum to syllabus, to attendance forms which were expected three times each class period!

The HR woman was nice enough during the phone interview and sent me the skills test.  After taking the skills test I was called in for an interview with HR then a group interview with the managers.  The HR interview was fine, but really long.  I got the sense of it being a corporation like I have heard.  I work at a different univeristy now and worked at another one in socal before this and this is NOT the same higher ed feel to it.  It very much feels like a business.  I was the first one interviewing with the managers who were cold, unfriendly, and to the point.  At one point they said the position was not for someone who slacks off or is a slow worker or doesn't work fast...they made me feel like that's what they thought I was.  They were pretty rude, and when I asked questions they almost look bothered that I did.  When I left they said \"well best of luck to you\" as if they had made a decision right there.  Nothing about being in touch or any friendliness at all.  A week later I got a call from HR that the managers still hadn't decided and if I would like to still be kept in the loop.  I said NO because if they hadn't decided by then, why would I want to be a second choice?  Especially after how rude my managers would be!  The job I ended up getting is much better.

She was very nice and polite.  She gave me a brief description of the position, and asked me at least twice if it still seems like something I would be interested in.  She set up date for me to meet with another recruiter in person.\r\nThe 1:1 interview took about half an hour. This new person was very pleasant as well; very informative about the position, careful listener, great conversational skills; asked good questions, and answered mine very well.  She set up a second interview for me to meet with senior management. \r\nSenior management .... awful. Extremely unprofessional and rude. The interview took 20 minutes. I was interviewed by two women, one of them being COO of Admissions.  The COO did not even pretend to be paying attention: she made virtually no eye contact with me, and literally sat with her chin in her fist staring at the wall behind me most of the time. They both kept arguing with me when I said that a certain skill I use in my current job is relatable to this position.  When I asked if my understanding of this position as somewhat of sales job was correct, they said \"No!\" and started asking me which one of the recruiters gave me that impression; this was a bit uncomfortable because they asked it in a way that made me feel like I would get the poor woman in trouble by giving her name.  Then they gave me the signal that my time was up, and that someone would be in touch if I get the position. As I stood there thanking them for their time and saying my goodbyes, one of them turned to the other and said, \"ok, which one is next?\" I wasn't even to the door yet!\r\nWhat still blows my mind about that experience is, how does somebody get to be COO of any place without having even the most elementary grasp of basic etiqutte?", "Interview Questions": "How would you convince a young person who's not sure what to do with his life that the Academy is the right place for him?"}, {"date": "9 Jan 2012", "title": "Administrative Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at Academy of Art University (San Francisco, CA) in Jul 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied to few positions online and got an email from a recruiter to schedule a phone interview.

The second interview was a 1:1 face to face interview.  I appreciated that the interviewer asked questions about my background and experience relative to the position, rather than talking about irrelevant details as some interviewers are wont to do.  After spending an hour sharing my qualifications, experience and transferable skill sets, however, I was very disappointed that I would not have an opportunity to dispel any residual misconceptions or misinterpretations of my qualifications.  It is not that I did not ask for these objections, because I definitely did, but the interviewer would not share them with me.  So, I thanked her, politely left, and noticed as we walked out of her office that she gave what I describe as an unprofessional 'look' to her colleagues across the hall (this whole office was busy with interviewees) - she thought that I did not see it as I was following her out.\r\nThe next step would have been an interview with a director and a COO that was described more than once as being, 'firm but fair'.  Work culture is described as fast-paced and hands-on, and I could tell that the amount of autonomy I had held in my former positions was going to be a problem in this organization.\r\nThough the interviewer I met with was nice(to my face), the interview process was average and what I learned about the organization and the job in the process led me to believe that this was not a good fit.", "Interview Questions": "What will be the biggest challenge for you in this position?"}, {"date": "24 Nov 2015", "title": "Part Time Tutor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at Academy of Art University (San Francisco, CA) in Jun 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview was informal, very relaxed.

Anyways, I got my first initial call from the Recruiter, who on the phone seemed really interested in me. We spoke about the different positions, and I was surprised she actually suggested she would pass along my resume to her colleagues, that hire for other departments if the position she was recruiting for wasn't to my liking. She even wanted me to consider other positions. Seems too good? Yup. My in person interview seemed totally opposite of the conversation on the phone. AAU has people lined up all day long sitting in the chairs next to you, so that person sitting there is interviewing the same one you are!

The person who was leading the interview asked why I no longer worked there and I told her that I had been laid off.

I explained to her that the company cut the people who made the most and the least in commission.  She still acted like she thought I was lying.  VERY unprofessional.\r\n\r\nIt gets worse.  I asked if there was any chance of advancement in the company and the same woman told me -- and I quote -- \"Well, you have to work for it.  No one's going to give you something for free.\"  I wish I were kidding here, but that's what she said.  I told her that I expected to work hard, but I wanted to know if there was at least potential for advancement.  She then proceeded to tell me her life's story.  How she got to this job right out college and worked hard and that's why she was in the position she was in.  In short, the interview turned out to be mostly about her.
