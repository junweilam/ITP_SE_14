I was invited to interview for the Patient Access Coordinator role because the previous manager thought that would be a better fit. I drove to DC ( about 50 minutes) and met with two managers in the Patient Access Dept. These women were very nice and informed me of all the perks of the position and basically told me I would be great for the job. The next day, I was asked to take three more assessments and that after the assessments were completed mangement would find \"the best fit\" position for me. Received an email ten days later requesting that I come back to the Silver Spring office for another face to face.  I went back to the office and was asked to take another assessment!
