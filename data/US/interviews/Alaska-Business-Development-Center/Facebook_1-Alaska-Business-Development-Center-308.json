The recruiter I worked with communicated each step clearly and explained each interview step. You do have to pass a couple assessments, though. Everyone I interacted with was very kind and professional. The final step before a decision is made is a panel with managers and directors. They run the interviews very conversationally. How they treat you during the hiring process is exactly how they treat you once you're hired - like family. As with any interview, know your why and how you think you'll be a great fit. Try and understand Pluralsight's solution and be prepared to speak to why you'd be a successful rep.", "Interview Questions": "How long do you want to work here?"}, {"date": "25 Aug 2022", "title": "Full Stack Developer Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at Alaska Business Development Center (Anchorage, AK) in Feb 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "It was casual and centered around questions that involve how I did in work at my previous jobs while there were some brain teasers, very intersting interview process and absolutely a great interview.", "Interview Questions": "What were you responsibilities in your last position?"}], []]
