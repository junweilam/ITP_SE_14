After, candidates were asked to create a multi-channel campaign for the department with a three day turn around timeframe -- I was told by a friend in a different department that my 20+ page document was the norm, as other candidates also submitted equally long-winded \"projects\". I appreciate being given sample tasks and the opportunity to showcase how your skills and approach will mesh with a team, but this felt excessive at best and exploitative at worst. After submitting the project, I was asked for references, a process that took almost 2 weeks to complete, and was then sent an automated email from the HR department sharing that, after all of that, I had not been selected. Admittedly, this outcome feels like a bit of a relief after this quite strange process. I'm not sure the department I interviewed with is adequately prepared both in theory and practice to be successful with their goals. I hope I'm proven wrong, if only for the sake of my friends who work in different departments.  In a phrase, the whole process left a bad taste in my mouth.", "Interview Questions": "What CRM databases are you familiar with?

I actually had a great interview experience over the phone, I spoke with their director who was super intelligent, and unlike most residence life staff at the top, seemingly unweighted down by the weight of the department.\r\n\r\nDuring the on-campus interview, things were even better, but the person who initially interviewed me was out. Even so, the man who interviewed me for the majority of the day was great, well educated, and very invested in finding a good fit for the department. I was interviewing for a position for someone who had just left last minute. The interviewers both had mentioned this several times, and were super nice about it, speaking of the their exiting employee in positive ways. The exiting employee had not confirmed her appointment at her new position just yet, meaning I could have been very well interviewing for a position that was going to be kept. Still, the experience was a positive one. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the interview the assistant director did the benefits check - the benefits were not great, and the salary was sub-par for a masters level position. In retrospect, I would not have taken the position based on salary; you don't go from 30k+ without a masters to 29k- with a masters....thats just complete nonsense. Especially for the ridiculousness that comes with being in residential affairs. But the opportunities to grow as a professional, work with liberal arts students again, and also have the chance to be close to home in Mystic would have been enough to dilute the decrease in salary.\r\n\r\nStill the environment seemed very nice, and the people I spoke to were great in referencing the institution in many positive ways.\r\n\r\nThe only CON to the entire experience was the reference checking. As is with referencing, we put down only the references we want potential employers to speak to. These folks did not follow protocol, and instead called my supervisor, who was not aware of my search, and was not listed as a reference. Several weeks later, my supervisor brought up the phone call - a super uncomfortable conversation - and mentioned how RWU noticed she was not listed as a reference, but wanted to know her opinion on my leaving. LOVELY! Needless to say I was mortified, and also super disappointed that I could have gotten the job if the references I wanted, were actually called. \r\n\r\nFor future reference, please only call references listed. It is inappropriate for any employer to do that.", "Interview Questions": "How do you approach conduct related conversations? \r\nHow do you make them more educational and less punitive?"}], [{"date": "8 Mar 2016", "title": "Social Media Manager Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Roger Williams University (Bristol, RI) in May 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "very pleasant experience. over the phone, then in person.
