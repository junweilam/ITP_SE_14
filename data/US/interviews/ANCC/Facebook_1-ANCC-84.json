The HR department has since turned over several times, but subsequent interviews were equally opaque, according to more recent staff.  In addition, the job turned out to be significantly different than the way it was described to me in the interview.  The director informed me during my interview that the department was fully staffed and ran smoothly; both of which turned out to be untrue.", "Interview Questions": "Can you explain more about your applicable experience?"}], [], []]
