We started with a one page DISC assessment and together with the interview I was there for a total of one hour. The interviewer was very rude. She was constantly interrupting me and her tone of voice was rather strong. I don't think I got through a single question without her interrupting. I could not give a proper answer because of this.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was getting the feeling the school is not very friendly towards certain individuals.  The interviewer was asking information that would reveal my ethnicity and background information. I should mention I did not see any colored people working on the campus. The students did not appear diverse either. \r\n\r\nDuring the interview, the woman interviewing me also did not take my paperwork which already suggests that she knew she did not want to hire me before she even started asking questions. \r\n\r\nI was also told I would get called the following week after they complete interviews. I received a rejection letter immediately after leaving the building and then a second rejection as a reminder a week later.

I was informed that up to this point they were extremely impressed and the recruiter told me that i would certainly be hired for this position or another one at UAT  The next round interviewer was out on vacation so i met with the president of the university. He asked me several inappropriate questions unrelated to my ability to accomplish the job tasks as assigned in the job description. Two days later i received a phone call that they had already hired someone for the position i was interviewing for. After that conversation i noticed that the job description was posted once again and when i asked about it i was informed that it was posted just to collect resumes. I was told that they wanted me to meet with another director for a position in a different office and that it was my choice to turn down this new position. This was not a meeting it was an interview that I was unprepared for because i was denied a job description after requesting one several times. I was then informed 2 weeks later that i would not be hired for this position either, with no further explanation.

UAT functions as an open-concept office, so I interviewed with the talent specialist in a very casual, yet private, common space.  The interview took about an hour and focused on culture and fit.  I did have operational questions, but the specialist couldn't answer them because of the nature of this first interview.  I was not prepared for this type of interview; I do wish I had known the nature of it before going in.\r\n\r\nI was most disappointed with the conclusion of the interview.  The specialist spent significant time telling me of next steps -- I'd be brought back in the following week for the next rounds, that I'd have three more sets of interviews, that two would be scheduled on the same day, and other indicators that I'd be moving forward.  I followed up afterward with my thank-you email and how I was looking forward to the next steps.  The next communication I had was a week later, informing me that the position had been filled by someone else.  A few days after that, the position was readvertised.\r\n\r\nI requested feedback from the specialist but I heard nothing.\r\n\r\nIMHO, the specialist should not have led me to believe I was moving forward, whether or not I had a chance of doing so.  There are other ways to explain next steps to make clear to the applicant what the steps are without leading the person on.", "Interview Questions": "What is something that you believe in that none of your friends or colleagues believes in?"}, {"date": "22 Dec 2016", "title": "Bindery Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0The process took 1 week.\u00a0I interviewed at UAT (University of Advancing Technology) (Tempe, AZ) in Sept 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "Everything was very smooth and fast.
