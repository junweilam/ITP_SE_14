While interviews seemed to go well for me, I am pretty shockes with this corporation as they never make follow up contact after I have applied to jobs both in Christiansburg & Roanoke where registered nurses with BSN degrees are supposedly in demand. I am trying to get into a nursing residency with this group as a nurse returning to practice after requiring multiple surgeries over the past 4 years that I needed prior to returning to work. They tried to say I never responded to any further emails or phone calls foowing interviews for multiple positions, but absolutely NOBODY has contacted me in any shape or form other than an automated email as much as 8 months later saying I was not hired with zero explanation. They never specify what they are looking for in tetms of work experience and despite trying to be a blank slate ready to learn tons of new skills to help my community, many positions never mention any applicant needs 5 or more years of experience in any given specialty and imply that being unable to work due to physical disabilities that need corrective surgeries to return to full function to be able to work are acceptable. What is even more ridiculous is that I am not an unknown there: I did almost all my clinical training as a nurse at Carilion Clinic & frequently brought patients to their emetgency department as an EMT-B on a local rescue squad. I have called around to places I interviewed at after 1-2 weeks, but might as well left messages in dead end voicemail boxes. Beyond that, when I have gone to the human resources to follow up on job applications & make sure they have everything required, the staff was shockingly hostile & kicked me out, refusing to help me out with anything. I never threatened anyone & wanted to simply see if they needed anything else from me or my referral professional contacts who have seen my work. The blatant incompetency among staff // management responsible for hiring practices proves that many there should be fired & work in a totally different field.
