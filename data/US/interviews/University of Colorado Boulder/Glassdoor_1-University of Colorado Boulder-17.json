After a moment or two, I was told the instructions for the presentation and handed a binder with the interview questions in it. Then I was told by one interviewer that he would be reading the questions aloud to me and I could ask them to repeat them, but they could not elaborate or help me in any way. ? At this point he also told me they were not allowed to interact with me, other than the questions, and oh, by the way - as he plopped a mini-recorder in front of me and turned it on - this was being recorded.\r\n\r\nI was floored. This was by far the STRANGEST interview I have ever been on. This was for a graphic designer job - not an oral presenter, not a teaching job...to not be told about being recorded until the day of, to not have face-to-face interviewers allowed to interact with me was just bizarre.
