A few days pass and I\u2019m asked to come in for a face to face interview with the same director.  Another few days pass and I\u2019m asked to provide 4 references, 2 have to be direct managers.  I was assuming that this meant an offer was coming shortly thereafter.  But no, I\u2019m asked to come in for another interview with the actual team I\u2019d be managing and the SVP of finance.  The team members were nice enough but less than impressive.  When I asked what they wanted from their manager, their response was basically that they wanted someone to work just like they do.  Nothing about development or anything a savvy professional would say.  Then I met with the SVP of Finance.  While she was nice enough as well, she loves to hear herself speak.  They had allotted 30 minutes with her, it went on for a little over an hour.  I might have spoken for 10 minutes.  She conveniently dropped in there that she typically works from 7am to 8pm every day and kept tying it back to how much she demands of her leaders.  Overtime was also a common theme talked about by the team members.  It was of no surprise to me that the team members weren\u2019t interested in this leadership position, because they have no desire to work free overtime.  Can\u2019t blame them for that.  I couldn\u2019t even muster the ability to stretch the truth and make it appear as if I too, want to work 12 hour days for a paltry salary.  In my experience, when workers are constantly doing overtime, there are process issues that need to be fixed.  I walked away from the interview thinking the team members probably milk OT to make up for their small salaries and all they really wanted out of their manager was to help them do their work and sign off on their timesheets.  The SVP determines value by how long you\u2019re in the office, not by what you actually do.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview, I wrote professional thank you emails to both the director and SVP.  I provided feedback and my assessment for how I can help.  The team desperately needs a leader, not another worker bee.  I have vast experience improving processes that improve both employee and company performance. That\u2019s apparently not what they want, as I never received any responses to my emails. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m providing this review not because I\u2019m upset, but to help anyone who may be looking into working in the finance department at this company.  You are going to be asked to spend a lot of your time interviewing, need to provide references, etc. only for them to completely ghost you after the fact.  Utterly unprofessional.  I get a kick out of seeing them repost this position to make it appear as if the requisition isn\u2019t as old as it is.  Nearly 3 months later and these folks still can\u2019t find someone to fill the role.  You would think they are looking for a rocket scientist.  \r\n\r\nBottom line:  Unless you are desperate, and have nothing but time at your disposal, I wouldn\u2019t waste my time applying here.

(interesting because I've been with my current company for 9 years).  I was told they'd have a decision by the end of the week.  I followed up the following week and kept getting responses that we can talk tomorrow, we can talk the next day.  This went on for over 2 weeks with me waiting around for her call.  Finally I get a call from the CIO and VP of IT telling me that leadership wanted to go another direction with the focus of the position and I wasn't a fit.  However, they both felt I was a great fit for their organization and they would find me another role.\r\n2 weeks later I get an email asking me if I was still interested in that position - to which I replied I was.  I came in the next day and spent about 1 1/2 hours discussing the position.  Next we setup 3 30 minute phone calls with the staff who would report to me for the next day.  I asked whether they were the decision makers and was told they weren't.  The following day i called into a conference bridge and had the calls with the 3 managers.  I thought the calls went very well.\r\nWas asked Friday whether I could talk Tuesday (Monday was a holiday) and answered that I was available all day.  No call on Tuesday (which I guess is just the norm).  Wednesday AM get an email asking if we could talk in the afternoon.  Well after being 10 minutes late calling me, i was told that the staff didn't feel a connection with me.  Now I'll be honest with you - in my entire career the one thing I bring to any job is my ability to connect with people and build relationships with them.  So basically - the staff didn't want this position filled (new position between them and the VP) so they decided to block me.  What's interesting is the connection I had with both the CIO and Hiring manager was very strong and they both admitted that to me.  The staff was obviously successful, but was very surprised that the VP would let them make the hiring decision. \r\nI'd really watch out with this place - especially in the IT department.  If you are coming into a senior position you are at the mercy of the lower level staff.  \r\n\r\nAll in all it was a waste of time and energy.  I would have rather them say no, no thank you early on and let me move on.  Instead they dragged it out and wasted an incredible amount of my time.", "Interview Questions": "Please tell me about yourself"}], [{"date": "24 Feb 2016", "title": "Accounting Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 week.\u00a0I interviewed at American Public University System (Charles Town, WV) in Apr 2012", "Interview Descriptions": "I was interview by the manager of the department and the recruiter provided the rest of the process, it was easy to do.
