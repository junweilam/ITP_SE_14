That never happened. I was surprised to find that I was being interviewed by not one, but six people. After answering their questions for close to an hour, a development person popped into the call and began to ask me a bunch of other questions. By the end of the call, I DID not want the job. The committee told me they would get back to me about whether I would advance to the next stage -- a common courtesy. While I didn't want the job, I was surprised that there wasn't any follow-up, particularly since I sent them an email thanking them for their time.", "Interview Questions": "They asked standard questions, such as how I would deal with antisemitic matters on campus, my fundraising experience, etc. I think my values were more progressive than theirs. I shared that I hoped to create dialogue between Jewish and non-Jewish groups, and encourage them to participate in difficult conversations around race, gender, Israel, antisemitism, etc. to create greater understanding and awareness.
