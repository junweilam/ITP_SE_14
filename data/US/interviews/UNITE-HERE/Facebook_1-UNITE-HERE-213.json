I\u2019ll confess it was off-putting and the fact that it was essentially voluntary seemed inappropriate for a Union (I\u2019m from a 3 generation union family).  Afterwards I spoke with a senior member of the Union who told me it everyone does it and it\u2019s a test of \u201chumility\u201d.

Two weeks later, I was invited to have a phone interview, and I felt like it went really well. I was told that I would hear about their decision by next Wednesday regardless. I heard nothing, despite having reached out with a thank you and follow up information. On Monday of the following week I recieved an email asking me come to meet this Wednesday. I said yes, and asked for more information, excited that they decided to continue me in the hiring process, since it seemed like an important and exciting organization. \r\n\r\nHowever, when he called me he told me that I did not have enough campaign and research experience for the position, but wanted to meet me about a apprenticeship program. I expressed gratitude for his honesty and interest in connecting me with the program.  I told him was hesitant at the word apprentice as I am looking for full time professional work, but wanted to hear more in advance. He revealed that as a \u201ccampaign apprentice\u201d I would work get a hospitality job and organize my coworkers, basically being a low-wage plant with two jobs, one of which is extremely risky and the other which seems to be unpaid labor. \r\n\r\nTo me, this feels like a total bait and switch. I regret the time that I spent learning and writing about Unite Here. While I enjoyed my phone screening, this is a manipulative and hypocritical recruitment tactic. Just be honest about what you are looking for! At least from the beginning of the phone call.

Then, contacted by a Los Angeles organizer for another phone screening. I was given a writing exercise and then asked to come in for an in-person interview with a group. \r\n\r\nThe in-person interview was not particularly hard. They had a list of questions and made sure to go through all of them. I quickly realized that it wasn't going to be a good fit personality and culture-wise. I found one of the interviewers to be pretty rude from the beginning, but it might have just been their interview tactic to see how I reacted under pressure. Nonetheless, I found it unnecessary. \r\n\r\nUNITE HERE is a labor organization that prides and promotes itself as a radical, militant union that represents mostly immigrant women of color. What I found strange was that I was interviewed entirely by white people. They were transparent about the fact that their main goal is to build their membership and that they are hierarchical meaning you're expected to execute orders from above and not push back. \r\n\r\nThey're not really at the vanguard of movement-building so I'd suggest to look elsehwere if you're seeking more mind-expanding work.

They asked a lot of probing questions regarding my political and personal philosophies. It felt less like an interview and more like a conversation with friends. The interview format itself was fantastic, unfortunately, it took them until the end of the interview process to ask me to remind them which position that I was applying for. When I told them, they told me that they weren't actually hiring for this position (nor were they aware that they had that position available) although I had seen advertisements for that position an hour before going to the interview, and again an hour after returning home. \r\n\r\nThen they told me that the position that they were hiring for was to actually go into these locations that are known to have tough and potentially dangerous working conditions, work for those companies, build trust of the other employees, encourage them to unionize, then volunteer for the labor union for an additional ~20-30 hours per week gratis. They weren't interviewing me for a job, they were interviewing me to give up my current job to *volunteer* for them.\r\n\r\nThis was a total *bait and switch.* As a union, their function is to fight against unethical situations  in the workplace... yet their own hiring practices are deceptive and unethical.
