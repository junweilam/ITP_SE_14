I got a call saying I got the job and they continued the process. I then let them know about some vacations I was planning and some days I would like off. Only one of them I could not accommodate but the rest were up to them to decide on whether I was given those days off or not. After bringing this up, I was told there was a scheduling issue and I was no longer able to have this position. The position offered to me was per diem so that confused me but stuff happens and I accepted it. I was then offered two other job positions which were completely different to the one I applied to. I wanted to look into them some more before making a final decision and I was told to take my time.
