I wasn't going to take the interview, but decided I was interested in finding out why they would have wanted to meet with me. I was very clear that I am in analytics, and they told me right away that's not the type of person they were looking for. \r\n\r\nThey were also 10 minutes late to the interview.\r\n\r\nOverall, I didn't get a professional vibe from them. They are clearly successful in what they do, but the type of people they hire are basically hands-on paper pushers and blue collar workers. If you're remotely analytical or looking for a white collar position, this won't be the place for you. If you're blue collar, hands-on worker, this will probably be right up your alley. And I mean no disrespect with that. Some people like getting their hands dirty, others like to stare at spreadsheets all day (my specialty). Business and college grads, this isn't the company you'll want to work for.", "Interview Questions": "Did you like working for your former boss?"}], []]
