The interview style varied a lot but all were very general. Many of the same questions are asked by different people. I felt unclear about the position throughout the process. I never really gained clarity about what the job entailed and who I would be working with because I talked to so many different people from different parts of the company.

Continuing on... After scheduling a video chat interview with HR for the next business day, the video chat occurred at the time scheduled. There were two of them on the video chat. They were friendly and took turns asking questions. The interview did not last too long either. It was fewer than 30 minutes in length, maybe about 15 minutes or so. It is helpful to search interview questions in advance and write your answers out to have them already handy. It also helps to have a copy of your resume to reference. Following the interview, I received a job offer via email in under 24 hours as well as the paperwork for the completion of a background check. The background check took less than one day, and subsequently I was emailed by HR within a few hours with the new hire paperwork to fill out and sign along with appropriate handbooks and other relevant, informative paperwork. Upon completing the requirements on my end, I was informed of a future shipment to be arriving for me via mail (I believe possibly a \"work\" laptop or any other relevant things required to have). Upon receiving said shipment, then one would refer back to the email from HR with all the paperwork, which includes a document that specifies the setup process for the laptop. After this, you will be contacted by a couple more people to ensure you are set up prior to the first day of work. At some point during the first, second, or maybe third day, you will be required to display via video chat the documentation used for identity verification during the hiring process. And finally, the first three weeks will be training for the position. Your start date will be day 1 of said training. And your start date basically just depends on what date the next training class is started for new hires. (My start date was set for approximately 1.5-2 weeks after the background check and hiring process was completed - this time amount is needed for receiving the aforementioned shipment and getting set up properly!)", "Interview Questions": "The position includes frequent talking on the phone, so is that something you're comfortable doing?"}, {"date": "10 Jan 2022", "title": "Admission Specialist Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Penn Foster, Inc (Scranton, PA) in Jul 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "During my interview, I had a great conversation and interview process with the two ladies.

He did come back 2 days later and said they were selecting other candidates with more B2C experience. That\u2019s fine, I felt that the email was sent just to be keep me warm as a backup candidate. Seeing that this role is still unfilled, at this time, I would suggest this company scale down the requirements. No one is going to be an expert in data science and google analytics/google tag manager and also knowledgeable about bridging multiple data sources to do reporting across multiple marketing channels.

The overall implication was that he has realized relatively quickly that he felt I was not a match, but he allowed the interview to continue.
