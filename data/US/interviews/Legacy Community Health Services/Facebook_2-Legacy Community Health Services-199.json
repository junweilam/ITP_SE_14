Maybe about two weeks to get a phone call inviting me to an  interview. Pretty straight forward at this point. When I arrived in the scheduled date I did had to wait about 10 minutes but that's okay it's a clinic. When I entered the room, I did see two of them taking a glance at my resume and I was relieved because other places do not even do that. They made sure to note that they saw I didn't have experience in my resume (no experience after college). I acknowledged that as being true. Then basically they just really just gave me the 'tell me about yourself' question and handed the interview to me because they didn't know how to do it. This was bad in my opinion because it showed that they weren't prepared to have me in and maybe were just trying to fill a quota. This is annoying because it's a waste of my time. My resume is pretty clear about my background to not waste time. I give them a rundown of my background and say that the requirements for the position were just a high school diploma and basic math etc. (This is what competency modelling is supposed to do.) From this point on they really didn't have questions, the questions you see in this comment were only brought up because I put great effort to try to create a conversation as they were clueless. I was the one asking the questions to them and interviewing them. I asked them about how they like to lead a team, clarification of job duties (no insurance verification, NO PHONE CALLS contrary to what the ad said, simply checking in patients),possible  areas they could improve on and the check-in process. You might wonder what type of questions  they could ask someone without experience, the answer is hypothetical questions. \r\n\r\nThey told me that in a week I would receive a response but I was left with no answer. This is expected in today's job market however, I did expect a little better from them since they talk about sympathy for patients. I had made sure to tell them that as a patient of Legacy I had first hand experience with what interactions were in the front desk. Oh well.
