It was a great interview; I enjoyed the time I spent with the individuals who interviewed me. However, they were putting on airs about what the job was and what they were selling in terms of the position. I had read glassdoor prior to applying for the job so I went into the interview knowing what to expect. It is all about numbers with Mercy, they do not care about the quality of students. It is all about the quantity, they want/expect you to be beyond flexible with your schedule. I was told the position would be 9-5, they informed me I would need to do weekends and sometimes adjust my schedule to work at least 2-3 days a week hours such as 12-8. The admissions department is out of control; they are running that department as if it was a business. They have over 40 employees in the department who all come from a business background with no higher education knowledge or experience. It is a group think mentality, it\u2019s all about meeting your numbers. During the interview they also indirectly asked me if I had other applications out, and if I was interviewing with other institutions. They wanted to make sure that they were going with a candidate that was going to commit to Mercy because individuals have accepted in the past went through training and then left because they received another offer. If you want to work in higher education I would stay away from this school, they are a for profit school. As well, you would be reporting to assistant directors who have little to no experience in higher education and  were only hired because of nepotism.
