After each interview, the HR representative emailed me asking for feedback, which I provided. So, that is several hours of preparation, responding to emails and participating in the interviews. That doesn't include the time spent applying for the job. The HR representative called me after the interview with the team and left me a voicemail saying she wanted to talk to me about the position. I called her back a couple of times, but she never returned my calls, even though I was returning her call to me. I know not everyone is a good fit for potential job opportunities, and people are busy these days. But it really doesn't take more than 30 seconds to send a simple email to inform an applicant that the organization is going in a different direction. It would be understandable if it had been just one or two interviews. But four, plus follow-up emails?
