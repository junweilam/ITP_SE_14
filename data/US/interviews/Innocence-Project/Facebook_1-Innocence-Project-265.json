I was scheduled for an in person interview several weeks after that. After that interview I sent an immediate thank you and heard nothing back. I reached out a week later-no response. 2 months later I was called and told I didn't get that position and asked if I would be interested in interviewing for a different position, Manager of Network and Training. I looked at it, was interested, and applied. Phone screen, second interview and panel interview later(whole process took about 6 weeks and required me to use PTO from current position) I reached out to follow up...nothing. Reached out to HR. Nothing. 2 weeks later I was told they were pulling the job posting to rework the requirements. (During this time I also received an automated email that said the Individual Giving Coordinator hadn't received enough responses and they were going to rework and repost that as well). It feels as if they were unable to find someone \"good enough\" and will change the requirements after interviewing people. It is also felt disrespectful to the applicant as time is invested and they aren't quite sure what they are looking for until after the process has started. It's NYC---you can't find someone to meet your requirements??", "Interview Questions": "What advice would you tell an organization that was looking to hire their first Director of Development?"}, {"date": "28 Jan 2023", "title": "Associate Director of Individual Giving Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Innocence Project (New York, NY) in Sept 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "I want to second what the prior applicant for a development position at The Innocence Project recently submitted. I felt very neglected and ignored in the interview process despite a lot of communication on my part and timely submissions of everything that was requested of me. It was an awful process and I have given up hoping that I will ever hear anything from them.\n\nI have to say that this wonderful organization appears to be entirely in disarray in its development department. There are a large number of open positions and a current employee shared with me that a lot of people have recently quit. That person also added that the narrative about the cause for employee departures that is being shared with candidates is false. So I would be careful if you decide to interview for a position at The Innocence Project and ask a lot of questions. Transparency doesn't seem to be a thing there.", "Interview Questions": "Questions were excellent. No problem with that. The interview was great. The process, however, simply sucked.
