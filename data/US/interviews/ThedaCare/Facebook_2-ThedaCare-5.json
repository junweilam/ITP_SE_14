Typical phone interview exploring my skills and the role details. Next, verbally was told I\u2019d be emailed regarding an in person interview to be set up. Received a request for references at this stage before the in person interview. Never seen a request for references at this stage and was uncomfortable sharing them due to my current position. I drove two hours for the in person interview where the interviewee was late. The interview was scheduled for 1.5 hours. I met with the first person for 1.5 hours and then was asked if I was still able to meet with a second person. I agreed but had to literally stop and coordinate childcare because I wasn\u2019t going to be home as planned. The interview was easy going and flowed more conversation like and I felt comfortable with both interviewers. Went weeks without hearing an update, which definitely meant one thing, but believe that this company would have ghosted me had I not asked for an update on my own. Overall, the experience was negative but easy interview with questions relating to my current role, things I enjoy doing as an EA, etc.", "Interview Questions": "What do you enjoy about being an EA?"}, {"date": "24 Feb 2023", "title": "Epic Application Analyst Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at ThedaCare in Sept 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "It starts with a phone interview with a recruiter, then a supervisor connects for more conversation or informal interview, then panel interview with analyst from multiple applications and other leaders.

Interview questions and process was typical. No complaints.\n\nThe only negative aspect of the hiring process is they REQUIRE you to give 3 references, preferably 2 being previous managers, if you wish to be still considered for the role regardless if they actually intend to hire you or not. As soon as the interview is over, they tell you to expect an email asking for references and it needs to be provided within 24 hours otherwise your application is canceled. Per a source who applied at Thedacare, they also asked him/her for references but did not receive an offer or additional interest for further interviewing. Recruiter told this person they always ask for reference and they keep it on file for 1 year in case you apply again\n\nAfter providing references, they receive an email to complete an online survey with various questions regarding their experience working with you. I imagine it would take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to complete, which is quite lengthy for someone who's doing you a favor being a reference. \n\nI would advise anyone applying at Thedacare to carefully consider giving your references after an interview unless you feel confident (or don't mind wasting your references' time) that you may get the position. In my opinion, an organization that wastes your references' valuable time doesn't have any professional respect for you or anyone else's time, and not worth working for.", "Interview Questions": "What do you know about Thedacare?"}, {"date": "16 Feb 2021", "title": "OD Business Partner Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at ThedaCare in Jan 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "The recruiter sent out interview notes to me on accident along with a calendar invite to send me a decline letter.

What is very disappointing is that after 2 weeks, I have not heard a word for follow-up. The director indicated that she would be contacting me the next week, but has yet to do so after 14 days. I sent a brief email after a week asking if there was anything more I could contribute or clarify about my experience or background, and was never even given the courtesy of a reply. I think this is very unprofessional and rude and that I at least deserved some kind of communication about my status as a candidate when it was promised. It helped me to realize that I would never want to work at an organization where their word is no good and where follow-up is not considered a priority. I was amply qualified for the position and thought the interview went well, but I can accept that I was not their choice. What I can't accept is not getting a phone call, letter, or email telling me of their decision. I do not trust organizations or management that don't use correct business etiquette or apparently have enough consideration for others to offer closure to the interview process.
