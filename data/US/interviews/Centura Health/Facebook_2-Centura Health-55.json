I came in for multiple individual and team interviews and delivered a presentation. The interviews and my presentation seemed to go extremely well, with clear resonance. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the interviews, the hiring manager told me that I was one of the finalists for the role, and I would hear within a week or two about a decision. \r\n\r\nNot only did I not hear anything over the proceeding 3+ months, I was never pro-actively communicated to once in that time, by the hiring manager or the recruiting team. The only way I have gotten any information was by emailing them, multiple times with few replies. When they did respond, I was continually pushed off in those communications, with minimal information provided.\r\n\r\nI am fine with not having gotten an offer - that is the way of the job market. But to not be given any communication, any updates, with me being a finalist and for a high-value role (really for any professional role), is inexcusable. It is outlier behavior in the job market for professional roles such as this. It has given me a terrible candidate experience, and is particularly surprising given Centura\u2019s mission of \u201cnurturing communities\u201d and values including \u201ccompassion, integrity, and respect\u201d.  In fact, my interview presentation included my alignment with that mission and values, and it is incredibly disappointing that Centura is not living up to these (and more). \r\n\r\nAnother \u201chighlight\u201d: I was required to provide 4 people as references during the process, and those people took time out of their day to do fill out the lengthy reference tool - at 30 questions,  lengthier than any they had every seen. It was a big favor they did for me. And, apparently I was not in fact close to an offer, so that favor and these people\u2019s time were for naught. It is a standard in the talent acquisition field for references to only be checked at the end of a hiring process, near an offer.
