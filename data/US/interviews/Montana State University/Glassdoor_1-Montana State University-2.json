The screen consisted of four search committee members, each asking in turn a series of about three questions. It was my impression that the questions were prepared in advance and would be asked of all applicants who made it to the phone screen in order to ensure consistency. The questions were fair and of average difficulty, and attempted to gauge both the candidate's technical knowledge of IT topics and how s/he would handle hypothetical on-the-job situations.  About four days later, I was invited to visit the campus in Bozeman (traveling from Seattle) for an onsite interview.  Due to previous work commitments, the earliest I could visit was in about two weeks time, but they were willing to accommodate this.  The second interview consisted of the same search committee members with a similar round-robin question format. Again, it was cordial and respectful, and the questions were open-ended and fair.  The interview was followed by a less formal Q&A session during a team lunch, and concluded with an informative one-on-one meeting with the Associate Chief Information Officer / Chief Security Officer.  Two weeks later this same Associate CIO called me to express his regrets that I was not selected.
