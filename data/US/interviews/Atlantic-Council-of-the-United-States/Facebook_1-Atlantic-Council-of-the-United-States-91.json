One week later, I interviewed with the Associate Director for the division to which I had applied as well as an associate from HR. They were very friendly and professional. I really appreciated that they started by having me say what I knew about the Atlantic Council, as I felt it was a clever way of ensuring that applicants had read the website/other materials (I had reviewed everything I could get my hands on, so this questions wasn't difficult for me). The Associate Director reached out a few days later with an invitation to a second round interview as well as a writing/editing assignment, which I found odd but took in stride. The second interview was with the director of the division, also via Skype. Most of the questions in both interviews were fairly straightforward, though in the second round I was asked extremely specific questions about a work experience from a few years prior. I will admit that I had read the Glassdoor company reviews prior to interviewing and as such was on the lookout for indications of the overworking specified in many reviews.", "Interview Questions": "What is the Atlantic Council, and what does the Atlantic Council do?"}, {"date": "21 Aug 2015", "title": "Program (Research) Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Atlantic Council of the United States (Washington, DC) in May 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "After completing a series of interviews with the Atlantic Council, I am still in shock at how unprofessional the process was. Although I thought the first round, during which I was grilled for over an hour by four employees, went relatively well, I was constantly interrupted by the interviewers who at one point stopped to talk among themselves about something completely unrelated to me. The second round included a writing test which I believed I aced, a fact confirmed by the directors. The third round included an interview with the office directors, although using the term \"interview\" was perhaps a stretch. This experience was by far the worst interview I have ever been exposed to. The directors grilled me with questions that were completely subjective and biased for an hour. They harassed me with minute details about my answers and over-analyzed every tiny gesture and word that I used. I felt as though I was at an interrogation and not an interview. By the end of the interview, I wanted to laugh when the directors informed me about the salary. Absolutely ludicrous and not at all feasible in DC!
