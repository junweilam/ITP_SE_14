Things pretty much went downhill from there.\r\n\r\nHeard Country Chair wished to \"widen the pool\" and retained a consultant. Totally GC's prerogative, of course. But that also suggests an outsized reach for a Chair, a non-executive role. Or so I thought. Either way, it no longer was a job for me, and I didn't apply when the consultant, PwC, relaunched the competition. I was therefore surprised to get an email from PwC inviting me for an interview in a different city...in 48hrs. For me, the decision was to ignore or decline.\r\n\r\nThe approach wasn't ideal, perhaps more in tune with mass-recruting entry level staff. In my country, PwC's reputation in these matters appears well deserved. They would need to drag their recruitment processes to the 21st century, it would seem. \r\n\r\nGC's working to bring needed attention to poverty - an urgent goal.
