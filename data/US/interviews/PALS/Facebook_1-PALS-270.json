After passing the initial interview with the BCBA, I  was told that I would get a call back for a second interview. My second interview was supervised by a staff member in the child's home.  I ran 3 trials with a kiddo as the staff member observed me.  After my interview, I was told that I would get a call from the BCBA with in a couple of days. The next week I was called and offered a third interview and was told that this was their interview process. My third interview was much like the second interview, I ran a few trials with the kiddo and was observed. I was told at both observations that I did an amazing job and received  little to no feedback. I was told that the BCBA would call me in a couple of days.  The BCBA never contacted me. Early one morning I received a text message  from the women who observed me during my third interview, asking if our interview was still on for that day. I kindly told her that I didn\u2019t receive a call from the BCBA and I wasn\u2019t informed about an interview though I would be willing to attend. She never replied back. Within a few hours, I received an email stating they were moving forward with another candidate. Maybe I didn\u2019t cut it or maybe because I had no clue of the interview ,who knows. This  interview process was A TOTAL NIGHTMARE but like they say, when 1 door closes another 1 opens. I was hired on as a behavior specialist shortly after at an amazing company with top pay so  I really can\u2019t complain. \ud83d\ude00", "Interview Questions": "What would your past employer say about you?
