After this, I was invited to an extensive panel interview with 5 HR professionals.  Following the panel interview, I was asked to meet with the Sr. VP of HR and the HR Manager of Employee Relations, at the corporate Administrative offices.  The interview process took 4-weeks.  An offer of employment was made, contingent upon a satisfactory, full background check and physical.  \r\n\r\nTo be completely transparent to those who apply to JMH, the interview process was absolutely, without a doubt, the most comprehensive, yet friendly and professional process I have been through - in any organization.  Every individual exemplified compassion, a love for their employer's mission and the work they do... and, I always felt that I was being invited into a warm and caring family, each step along the way.
