I decided to apply at Allina for the same specialty area I was already working in for a different facility because I desired a reduction in my work hours. I received an email from a recruiter very quickly after applying that they wanted to set up a phone interview with the department manager. The interview was so-so; it was over Teams and apparently there were technical difficulties on their end where they were hearing an echo after speaking (which I could not hear). The hiring manager seemed annoyed about this, the interview questions were strange (this was several months ago and I don't recall them off the top of my head), and the hiring manager seemed to have her mind made up about me seeing that I had only been at my previous job for about 2 years. She mentioned that and asked what it is I was looking for \"since you seem to jump around.\" I explained that I had not been able to obtain a desirable schedule at my last two jobs but the hours posted for this position would be a great fit for me and my family. I did not receive an offer, but was encouraged to continue to apply for open positions I was interested in. Over the next 6 months, I applied for the same department 7 more times. I was never offered another interview and would receive a rejection email fairly quickly after applying-so EIGHT rejections in about 6 months, in a specialty area I am experienced in and really loved.

I was contacted by email the next day with a request for a video interview with the hiring manager which was scheduled for a week later. The video interview lasted almost an hour and had more details about the position and more behavioral interview questions. Hiring manager was pleasant and knowledgeable. Was very clear about follow up timeline expectations as well. Received an email from recruitment asking for follow up call several days later which led to a verbal offer. With some negotiating I accepted position several days after that. All in all time from application to receiving an offer was just over 2 weeks. \n\nVery positive experience that moved much quicker and more efficiently than many of the large Minnesota healthcare organizations I\u2019ve worked with in the past. My only feedback would be for recruitment to have a clear idea of salary if they are going to discuss salary with candidates. This was discussed during my phone screen, but recruiter was clear that they do not set the salary and can only view a range for position.
