This assessment had 5 sections and each section was timed. Good luck to anyone who has to do this cause it is difficult and does not relate to any aspects of nursing lol (except section 1).\n\nSection 1: was a rating of how relevant a characteristic/adjective was to you.  \nSection 2: The next section was of sentence completion.  They gave you a sentence and you had to match it with words that were provided. (it's harder than it sounds since the sentences were so long and complex). There were roughly 12 questions and around 8 minutes to complete.\nSection 3:  identifying which words were closely related to each other. \nSection 4: Two 3-dimensional images (similar to an awkward Tetris figure, but three dimensional) were shown and you had to answer if it was the same image or different. [hardest section]\nSection 5: They presented a word in which you had to a word that closely relates to it in meaning. \n\nThe main issue I had was that I had run out of time to complete some sections.
