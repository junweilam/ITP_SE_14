I guess it's common for them to do this in the moment and people feel the need to accept the terms and move forward with the process? They added different roles & responsibilities on the phone that the position would be responsible for which essentially sounded like a completely different job. \r\n\r\nA few years previously I interviewed with them for a different role in person and they were incredibly dismissive once they realized I would not be able to start the job immediately. The interviewers essentially said nothing and did not respond when I thanked them for time. It was very embarrassing and humiliating.", "Interview Questions": "Classic questions; how do you work on a team?
