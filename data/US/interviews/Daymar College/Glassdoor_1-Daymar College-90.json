I had an extremely frustrating and disappointing experience where after a very lengthy interview process (nearly two months) I was offered and accepted the position, only to have it withdrawn the business day before I started due to supposedly internal miscommunication and a lack of the company being able to support the position by the workload and pending buyout. And that was after I actually followed up simply to express my excitement at starting and asking if I should bring anything - so I don't even know when they planned to tell me. It was tough because I had given two weeks at my current employer AND passed up a promotion there to work at Daymar. This is now future lost wages to me. Just be very careful if you're considering working there. They have much to fix after losing their accreditation and subsequently, nearly half of their student body. They are also in the midst of trying to complete a buyout of themselves to another educational company, so if I were you, I would steer clear for awhile until they get their situation settled. I understand that things don't always pan out, but I just felt they acted incredibly unprofessional and recklessly in regards to my time and personal career that had impacts that I'm still dealing with. It was just incredibly irresponsible.", "Interview Questions": "What sales experience do you have? What motivates you? Are you competitive?
