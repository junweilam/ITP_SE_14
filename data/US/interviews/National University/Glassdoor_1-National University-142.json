Had a phone interview with the manager 2 days later, it was rescheduled once.  He seemed in a hurry to get me in to meet the team and he seemed like he wanted to fill the position very quickly.  Had to wait until after the holidays to do the interview with the team.  Had an onsite interview to meet the hiring manager and team, only about 1/2 the people that were supposed to be there showed up.  Interview seemed to go great, at the end I asked manager if he had any doubts I could do the job, he said he didn't see anything that was stopping me moving forward.  Again he brought up the issue of me wanting to give 2 weeks to my current employer, this seemed to be something they did not like.  Trying to follow up 5 days later, no response.  Then again 2 days after that, go a response late in the day.  They decided they were going to continue interviewing other candidates, no feedback as to what the issue was.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "26 Feb 2014", "title": "Finance Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at National University (Scottsdale, AZ) in Jan 2014", "Interview Descriptions": "interview process was a typical process.  average questions you might get anywhere.  normal interview process of coming in to meet, and passing the background.
