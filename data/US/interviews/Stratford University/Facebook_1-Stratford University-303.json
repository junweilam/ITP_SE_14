He contacted me first via email to discuss relocation possibilities since I am not a local candidate, then conducted a phone interview.  The phone interview went really well, and he moved me on to a 1:1 video interview with a higher up.  Prior to the video interview the recruiter said \"you're going to make me look like a rock star\".\r\n\r\nNext was the first video interview that went very well. Lasted about 90 minutes and I got the impression that I was the only candidate at that time. I was then contacted for a second video interview with the COO. This one didn't seem to go as well. The video cut out about halfway through and we conducted the rest by phone, so it was a harder to read his body language after that.  He was pretty vague and seemed uncomfortable answering any of my questions [remember, an interview is a 2-way street ESPECIALLY if I'm going to relocate]. I think I may have offended him when I asked about the reputation of management (read employee reviews on Glassdoor - seems there's some unprofessional behavior going on with the President and other members of management).\r\n\r\nThe next thing I know I received one of those standard \"thank you for applying, we'll keep your resume on file\" emails. *Kanye shrug*", "Interview Questions": "No questions were too \"out there\" or remarkable.
