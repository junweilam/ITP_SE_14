Once contacted for an interview, I was asked to participate in two 45-minute interviews, one after another, to be scheduled in less than a week. Staff was wonderful to speak with, and I felt it could be a great fit. Unfortunately after these interviews, I didn't hear back for 3-4 weeks, despite sending follow up emails. With this lack of response and the extended timeline, I chose to accept another job offer and withdraw from the interview process. I received a response (after I had already accepted this other offer) expressing I had been a strong candidate and there was intention to move me forward in the process. Seems like a great team, but interview timeline and lack of responsiveness was too large of a negative in today's current job market.", "Interview Questions": "Share past donor relations project experiences"}, {"date": "9 Sept 2020", "title": "Student Admissions Associate Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Trinity College (Connecticut)", "Interview Descriptions": "Initial application phase, to one-on-one interview, and then candidate selection.
