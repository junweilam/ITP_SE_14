From there, I heard from a Lead Recruiter (that referred to herself as \"Senior Management\") who went through a list of standard prescreening questions, which seemed to have been read from a list. No insight provided as to the role itself. It was a one-way conversation. \r\n\r\nA week later, I heard from a virtual Consultant, who called to schedule a phone interview with the Chief HR Officer, for 8:00 AM on a Saturday morning. She called late, then proceeded to go through a list of standard questions as before. The call went 30 minutes. Low energy/enthusiasm again. I started to wonder if I should even continue on in the process. I was told that I would be hearing from the Consultant again re: an onsite interview. \r\n\r\nLater, I did get a call, but it was to set up a THIRD call, with her, for the following evening at 7:30PM. Once again, standard questions, a bunch of repeats that I had answered twice before. No real insight into the role, as she was not an employee, and didn't have any information to share about the working conditions, daily activities, etc. I was told I could expect an update within a few days. A week later, and I received an auto-generated email (no personal call, email) letting me know that I was not selected. \r\n\r\nAs a prospective employee, if you want to invest a lot of time and energy in seeking out employment (ex: the application, the personal assessment, 3 rounds of phone interviews) with KU, I'd suggest checking out some of the other employers in town first. They have the courtesy and professionalism to notify you by way of email or phone call, vs. a cold, auto-generated e-notification from KU. Clearly, growing pains (and possibly staff shortages) at this organization leak into the candidate experience. I think it is indicative of their views on candidates, and most likely, their employees.\r\n\r\nTrust your gut when exploring new opportunities. If you like working with intelligent, highly-qualified, experienced professionals, take note of the HR staff and the vetting process. In each of those conversations, if not one unique question was asked outside of a low-energy/enthusiasm pre-formatted screening battery, and very little time (if any) was allotted to sell you the organization, specifics about the role, and WHY you should want to work with them, then you might be happier elsewhere. I see it as a mentality that you should feel lucky to be called by them, a 1-way street. \r\n\r\nThe fact that they interview candidates at 7:30PM at night (via non-employee Consultant in Salt Lake City), and 8:00AM on a Saturday morning (via the Chief HR Officer) is a red flag in my mind. Very strange. SLOW moving as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, one of the worst impressions of an employer I\u2019ve ever walked away with. I think I dodged a bullet.  They obviously do not care about their Employment Brand and have very little understanding of how easy it is for candidates to steer away future hires within their network.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you interested in this role, and KU Health?

The map they gave showing how to get there wasn't accurate, but I eventually made it.  Had a second interview with three people involved.  I was told that they would not call if I was not offered the job, so just assume they had picked someone else if I didn't get a call.  Was offered the job the next day by the HR rep, and they overnighted employment paperwork to me.  I had to wait a few weeks until their next new employee orientation before starting.", "Interview Questions": "The HR interview wasn't bad, pretty standard.  The management interview was not so much difficult, but it was pretty intense because but they asked questions that were oddly specific, like where they wanted you to describe in detail situations you were in tat a past employer, and how you dealt with that. For example, \"When you were at your last job, what is an example of how a co-worker was difficult to deal with, and how did you resolve your conflict?\" or \"Explain in detail a situation at your last job where you saw a deficit in the processes and how you took a leadership role in resolving the issue?\"  Crap like that.  If I had a little bit of time to think about it, sure I could have come up with some sort of clever answer, but as it was It really put you on the spot with how specific the questions were. I'm sure most people just BS their way through that part because it's difficult to think of good examples for the questions they were asking. In addition questions like that, they asked me about my strengths and weaknesses, and a couple of silly questions just to see my personality."}]]
