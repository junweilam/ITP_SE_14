I reached out to former professors and connections, HR, and the CS director and shared my work portfolio. The school claims they support Lasallian values, but I\u2019m starting to believe that is false. Someone reached out on 12/20 for a brief phone screening and I was asked to join a zoom conference on 1/6. It was a panel interview with the supervisor and other admin. I felt inadequate, but I hoped they could sense my genuine passion for the vocation. I was asked to come to Lewis for an in person interview. I arrived at 11:20 and I left around 3:18pm. There was a snowstorm but I was determined to be there interview. Prior to that, I had a conference with the HR dept about all the amazing benefits, insurance, etc\u2026we talked about an hour and I felt certain that meant I was a top choice. I gave a 10 min presentation in front of two different groups. I tried to share personal stories when I was a student. The last part involved about 18 individuals coming in - deans, admin, PC, business dept, etc firing long winded questions. I had to keep asking them to repeat themselves and my brain was on overload. This tripped me up. Being towards the end of the interview (going on 4 hours) I didn\u2019t have the same tenacity and started to feel very intimidated. I can only imagine the things they said about my lack of experience and knowledge. I tried to write down everyone\u2019s name and emailed EVERYONE a thank you the next morning. I even offered to volunteer for an upcoming career services event. I followed up 3x after that, they kept telling me the interview process takes a long time. Today on 2/16 they shared they wanted to go in a different direction. They probably wanted someone more seasoned and didn\u2019t have patience for helping an alum develop professionally.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me what you know about Lewis\u2019 mission.
