It comprised of a 4 hour interview process with the staff I would oversee, senior leadership, an open forum with campus community members, and then a one-on-one with a VP. All of which were extremely pleasant and informal.\n\nThe issue I had is the lack of transparency and communication from either the VP and AnotherSource on the outcome of the interview process. This VP talked of communication, openness, and trust worthy and yet she perpetuates the culture by which she was proposing to change and this rubs me the wrong way by saying one thing and doing another.

The interview was conducted in mid-June.  All the members of the search committee were friendly and professional.  I also appreciated how well the search committee\u2019s chair kept me updated throughout her portion of the process. The interview consisted of a panel interview with the search committee, followed by a 15-minute presentation to an open forum group, and then a meeting with the hiring manager.  The hiring manager informed me that he was retiring at the end of the following month, and he wanted the person for this position to start before he left.\r\n\r\nEarly the next month, the chair informed me that I was the person that the search committee was going to recommend. The search committee chair checked my references and received approval from the hiring manager  and the university President.  \r\n\r\nAn interim hiring manager came on board in early August before an offer was extended to me . The new manager wanted to interview me, which was certainly this person's prerogative.  The manager began the interview by telling me that I was one of two finalists, which I found surprising and disturbing since the search committee chair never told me that it was between me and another candidate.  The manager did not provide a timeline for the decision process.  I tried following up with this person at least four times via email since we met, and only ne of my emails was responded to, wherein I was informed me that they were in the process of \u201cdeliberating,\u201d and that I would be notified when a decision had been made.  \r\n\r\nThe \"notification\" came six weeks later in the form of a system-generated rejection email  informing me that the hiring department had \u201cdecided to cancel this recruitment.\u201d  The same position was posted the following day!
