Many questions about faith which is expected, and I do not mind. But when your answer does not fit neatly within their mindset, HR was unwilling to be forthright or work at best possible solution. HR just wanted to check a box and move on. Unfortunately, life is messy because we are messy(that's why we need Jesus!) and situations and life events don't always check a box.
