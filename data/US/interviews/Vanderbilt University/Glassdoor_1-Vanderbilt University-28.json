I think the team/department is great, but the candidate experience is non-existent. I wish I would have been able to spend more time getting to know the team. I was invited to do a one-way interview via a video platform called SparkHire where you record yourself on video. There is no interaction with a human/or two way dialogue- it's very one way. First step is usually always talking to a human to find out why the role was open, align on compensation, etc. This was skipped. Then there was a 5 person interview panel with no indication for who would be on the call beforehand. This is also a strange way to do an interview, they jumped right into one-way dialogue during this interview. I did ask during the call for them to tell me more about the role and they did. After this, they mentioned that there would be a series of in-person interview steps, and a presentation. I thought the call went well. Before going through 10+ more hours of interviews, I asked if I could have a quick convo with HR to understand more about the compensation and next steps in the process. HR led me to a recruiter that I had no idea existed. So we scheduled some time to speak. She didn't know what the salary range was, or what the next steps in the process were- usually recruiters are the gatekeepers of this information. What does the recruiter do all day if she doesn't manage the relationship with candidates or hiring managers? And I think this is where the process fell off- she seemed to make a bigger deal than it should be to know what the comp could be, emailing all of these departments to try to figure it, which is bizarre. It's a little unfair to candidates to make them go through a very lengthy process, and not to tolerate any questions. It was after that, that I was rejected from the role. It's strange because I would have loved the role and would have been great in it, but I wasn't allowed to have human interaction or two-way dialogue, which I think is very tone deaf in 2023. An interview process is a window into the employee experience. I would hope being an employee at Vanderbilt is a better experience than this interview process. Imagine not being able to advocate for yourself or ask questions for fear of consequences? I would hope that this is only a reflection of a broken recruiting process.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "24 Jun 2023", "title": "Associate Director Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Vanderbilt University in Feb 2023", "Interview Descriptions": "It was very informal and conversational.
