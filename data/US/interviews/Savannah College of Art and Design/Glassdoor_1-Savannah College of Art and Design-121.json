If you are a SCAD alum, I think that they will instantly pull your application. I received an email for the first round of interviews that day after my application was submitted. The phone interview was only 10 minutes and the recruiter was nice and provided a lot of information. Within two days, I got the next invite for round 2, and that interview was a bit difficult. Especially since I have worked in the SCAD admission as a student, I thought that some of the questions were kind of repetitive from my previous interview and only personal depending on your own experience and background. It was almost a week after my 2nd interview that I received an email about not making the final round. I felt like I had to express how \"life-changing \"and \"amazing\" SCAD was. For me personally, SCAD did help me in my journey to my career field and I'm grateful for my time there, but there are still cons and personal experiences that if I can be honest about in a non-professional setting, I would warn students and families about the true reality of attending. Because I was familiar with what parents actually wanted to hear and questions that they had asked me from a student perspective about attending SCAD, my answers focused on the fact that the amazing faculty and students are what actually make the school what it is, not the flashy events and experiences. Because not everyone will be able to attend or experience things like studying abroad in France/Hong Kong or going to SCAD Day prior to getting in (I didn't) and I don't want to sell something unrealistic to a bright-eyed eyed 17/18-year-old kid and their parents.

This practice, although looked down upon in the field, is still somewhat common with recent grads who are trying to get their foot in the door.

The specific process can vary depending on the company and the position, but it generally follows a similar structure. Application: The first step in the interview process is usually the submission of an application. This can be done online, through email, or in person, depending on the company. The application usually includes a resume, cover letter, and any other relevant documents or information. Screening: Once the application has been received, the company will typically review it to see if the candidate meets the basic requirements for the position. This may involve a quick phone screening or a review of the candidate's online presence, such as social media profiles. First Interview: If the candidate passes the screening stage, they will usually be invited for a first interview. This may be conducted in person, over the phone, or via video conferencing. The purpose of this interview is to get to know the candidate better, assess their qualifications and experience, and determine if they would be a good fit for the company. Additional Interviews: Depending on the position and the company, there may be additional interviews with other members of the team, the hiring manager, or senior executives. These interviews may be more focused on specific skills or experience, or they may be more general in nature to assess the candidate's overall fit. Assessments and Tests: Some companies may also require candidates to take assessments or tests to evaluate their skills or knowledge in a particular area. For example, a writing sample or coding test may be given to candidates for certain positions. Reference Checks: Before making a final decision, the company may also conduct reference checks to verify the candidate's work history and qualifications. Job Offer: If the candidate has successfully completed all the steps in the interview process and is deemed the best fit for the position, they will be offered the job. The company will typically provide an offer letter outlining the terms of employment, including salary, benefits, and start date.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about yourself.

Although she was personable, I questioned her HR experience because she said to me, \"you are exactly what the creative team needs\", five minutes into our phone call. Her comment didn't seem very professional and was also setting my expectations pretty high when I hadn't even gone through the formal interview process yet. She also spoke at length about salary expectations, insinuating that I should be prepared for the salary to be low. When I asked the salary range for the position she said, \"I can't discuss that unless you get the offer.\" However, she was insistent that I tell her what I wanted to make, even though I said I would prefer to learn more about the role before discussing salary.\r\n\r\nWhen I made it to the next round, a Skype call was scheduled for 4pm with two directors of SCAD's creative agency. I received a text from the recruiter at 3pm, the day of the interview, asking if I could do the Skype \"now at 3pm\" and not 4pm. Apparently, the directors had wrapped their prior interviews early and wanted to do mine right away so they could leave earlier. I thought it was really forward and unprofessional to expect a candidate to jump and do an interview an hour earlier than scheduled, with no lead time. \r\n\r\nThe two directors I interviewed with seemed unenthused and preoccupied. I had also learned, through my own research, that one of the directors (the person who would have been my direct supervisor) was leaving his position. I had come across his job title/description, on the SCAD career webpage, posted a day prior to my interview. I am not sure if that contributed to the interviewees appearing preoccupied, but I assume it contributed to the conversation feeling a bit lackluster since one of the directors had one foot out the door.\r\n\r\nWhen I did my research on the recruiter, I learned she is a SCAD graduate, working in HR on the side as a recruiter, while also owning a fashion business. She had zero HR credentials on her LinkedIn profile. I would suggest to the higher ups at SCAD HR to make sure all of their staff are properly qualified to conduct interviews.
