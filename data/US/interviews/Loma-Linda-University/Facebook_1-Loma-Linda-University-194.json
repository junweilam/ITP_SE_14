I was interviewed by a professor after only submitting a resume by email. As far as I know, no ATS system like Taleo is used for these jobs and most of the time they aren't even posted online until someone internal already has the position. If you see an opporunity online that's been posted, it's likely outdated or taken. If you are called in for a interview, expect it to be somewhat informal.\r\n\r\nQuestions I was asked involved my employment history, experience in research and skill sets. Since I was a student already, most of my background was already known but whether or not I had the knowledge of the particular studies involved was another matter. If you are applying to the university side, questions will more likely be related to whether or not you know the LLU policies about their religion (SDA) and culture. If you are applying to the medical center, questions will more likely be related to clinical settings and whether or not you can handle working with physicians. You should know most physicians at LLU are spoiled rotten and egotistical twats but if you are used to that, they can be very professional otherwise.\r\n\r\nOther questions might include the standard \"tell me about yourself,\" and questions on computer skills. Since this is a research analyst position, you should be familiar with quantitative data analysis, data management and microsoft office. For some reason, they relish in Microsoft Office and Outlook like no one's business and most computers there are old.\r\n\r\nWhen you are hired, you will face a standard HR introduction meeting that generally informs you on LLU and it's rules and policies. It's 8 hours long though and you sit in a small dining room and that is very boring. After you actually begin working, you will likely be in a small office (read: closet) and in front of a computer or collecting data depending on their needs.", "Interview Questions": "It's a religious institution and so they ask you if you believe in God.
