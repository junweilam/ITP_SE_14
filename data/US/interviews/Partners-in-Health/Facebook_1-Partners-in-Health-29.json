I had previously applied for more administrative positions and had not received any sort of communication either way. I received an email from an HR staff in early November, which arranged a phone interview for mid-November. The HR staff member was late in making their phone call, but it focused on the nature of the position and the department (Training), as well as my interests, experience, and skills. A week later I went to the office for an in-person interview. I met with the majority of the department at one time. The interview was very disorganized. Members of the team entered the room at random, and many questions and discussions were repeated. The interview lasted for about an hour and a half because of constant interruptions. I was not provided with any business cards, even when I asked. Following the interview, I emailed a thank-you note to my HR contact and ask that it be extended to the rest of the team. I received no response. Between the end of November and the beginning of January, I received only one email from the HR contact, even after repeated emails and phone calls inquiring about the status of the position and interview process. Ultimately, I did not hear from the HR contact before receiving an offer elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe team members I spoke to seem very passionate, intelligent, busy, and hard-working.
