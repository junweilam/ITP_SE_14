A week or so afterwards, I received an email, asking to schedule a time for a 15 minute phone interview. 15 minute interview?! That's barely enough time to have a quick discussion about the position itself, and my background. \r\nI proceeded and scheduled the interview, and was informed via email that it was a round table interview with a \"committee\". I was also supplied a list of thought provoking questions in preparation for the 15 minute interview.\r\nWhen the phone interview started, there was no introduction to the position, nor an opportunity to talk about my background, so they could get a sense of who I was and where I came from. Instead, each person fired off a generic question (tell us a time where you did this, tell me about your leadership style, etc). One after the other. Then after the last person had their question, the hiring manager closed the interview, basically shutting down any opportunity for me to ask a question, and indicating that if I had any questions about the position, I could send him an email. There was still even time left in the 15 minutes, but the interview was still \"shut down\" by the hiring manager.\r\nPlease realize that not only are you interviewing us, but we are interviewing you as well. The job posting was vague and generic from the beginning, so I would have assumed the first interview would be a general introduction to both the position and my qualifications. Afterwards, if it seemed like I was a good fit, and the position was a good fit for me,  we could schedule a round table interview (longer than 15 minutes).\r\nAll in all it was a very strange and ineffective interview process.
