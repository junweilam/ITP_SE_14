About a week later, I was excited to see an email from HR that they were considering my application. However, as I got to the end of the email they were requesting I complete three (3) lengthy, time consuming scenario assessments. (see them under interview questions) 'Submitted responses are evaluated using a rubric and selected candidates are then extended an invitation to interview for the second stage. Please do let me know if you do not wish to continue your candidacy for the position. The hourly salary budgeted for this position is projected not to exceed $35/hour with occasional overtime available.' I graciously emailed back thanking them but declined the assessment. Since my submitted Cover Letter and Resume highlighting my 10+ Years C-Suite support experience led you to reach out to me for this position, lets have a conversation (interview) and get to know each other. I understand you are looking for the right candidate but I need to equally make sure this is a good fit for me. They replied stating they've removed me from consideration . Sorry, but I do not work for free and no other well-versed EA should either. These assessments are time consuming, biased, and not personable.

Planning Skills, Taking Responsibility It is your first week on the job, and there is much to learn about the organization, your position, and your scope of responsibility. After welcoming you and showing you your office, your supervisor directs your attention to a set of School of Education (SOE) Box folders which includes an annual calendar of events and recurring work responsibilities pertinent to your role. You have joined the organization at a busy time of year for the SOE with several looming deadlines. What steps will you take to ensure you are aware of your and the organization\u2019s responsibilities and deadlines? Prepare an email to your supervisor explaining the steps you plan to take to educate yourself and get started as well as what you need from him/her in order to proceed with confidence. PS2. Organization Skills, Core Knowledge One of the multi-step projects you will be coordinating for the SOE is an annual calendar for the SOE Board of Visitors. The BOV was recently reimagined as a working board with three subcommittees. The two new co-chairs, the dean and the associate dean of strategic initiatives are in the midst of planning for the year ahead, including receptions, board meetings, committee meetings, critical correspondence, etc. The new BOV will have three committees focused on: fundraising, leadership, and strategy. The Board meetings and receptions will be in person and the committee meeting will be held via zoom. Among the goals of this undertaking are: build community among the new members; keep the members informed of the SOE\u2019s goals, initiatives and developments; and support committee effectiveness in helping the SOE thrive. Develop a 12-month plan for the Board of Visitors that supports these goals and ends Nov 2023 with a culminating event that captures the hard work and initial impact of the newly revised BOV. The plan should demonstrate your skills and knowledge in organization, planning, design, communication, outreach, analysis, and implementation. Please include key dates, information you will provide to and/or request from whom, organizing strategies and tools you would use, etc. LMU R4958 Page 2 of 2 PS3. Ethics, Judgement, Concern for Org Culture You received a warm welcome from the SOE staff and faculty.
