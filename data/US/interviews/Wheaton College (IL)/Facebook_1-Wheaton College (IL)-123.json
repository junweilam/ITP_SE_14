The person interviewing me was 15 minutes late in calling, this was a prescheduled interview made by their HR department.\r\nMy rapport with the woman interviewer went well. We were both clear and candid with each other. The marketing department sounded like it was in transition so I don't feel they were clear in what they needed. I was over qualified but willing to take a lower position due to my life circumstances. I am writing this review to let others who interview know that they don't get back to you even if you politely email and leave phone messages asking for a courtesy call to let you know if the position was filled and where you stand in the process. During the interview she was very encouraging about my portfolio and potential of working in their department. They ask you questions of faith and integrity. Overall, disappointed that they seek others with faith and integrity but their actions don't shown those qualities. Actions in this case do speak louder than words. No decency in providing even a brief response. A return email or voicemail saying they weren't interested was simply right thing to do. Especially from a faith based college.", "Interview Questions": "One of the interview questions was would you be able to make a 2 year commitment."}, {"date": "3 Apr 2017", "title": "Office Coordinator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Wheaton College (IL) in Mar 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "One interview with HR then one department interview.
