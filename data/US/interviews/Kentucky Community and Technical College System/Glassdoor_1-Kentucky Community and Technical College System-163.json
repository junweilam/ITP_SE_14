After applying, I was sent an email for a date and time of an interview with zero flexibility. I reached out to HR to let them know their intended interview wasn\u2019t going to work with my schedule since I was summoned to jury duty. I would let the hiring manager know if anything had changed. They sent back an email requesting me to change my time - but jury duty had not left the table. The day of the interview I was summoned to a trial, missing the interview. HR had reached out to me to say \u2018are you coming\u2019 obviously no, I had already made them aware of the situation. I asked for a Monday reschedule PHONE interview. The hiring manager then told me I made no effort to communicate any of the above - and that that day was the ONLY day they could possibly do an interview. I let her know that I see they value a body in a chair over the skill set of the hire since they couldn\u2019t possibly be flexible and speak to me any other time. That is not how business is done in the real world, and I would never work for this company who can\u2019t even accommodate someone who has been summoned by the state for jury duty. Lack of flexibility and accountability - the hiring manager blaming me for her error, after I was flexible with them and changed the time. I normally don\u2019t even complain about scheduling conflicts - but this was beyond ridiculous. I was serving on a trial and now my consideration for a role is gone because they could only speak to me on one specific day and time.", "Interview Questions": "I didn\u2019t even get asked questions based on their hiring process and not bein able to have flexible scheduling."}, {"date": "24 Jan 2017", "title": "Developmental Reading Instructor (Read Right) Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Kentucky Community and Technical College System (Ashland, KY)", "Interview Descriptions": "I was already employed as an Adjunct (i.e. part-time) English Instructor, so the Humanities Division Chair encouraged me to apply for the position of Developmental Reading Instructor (as it was a full-time position). I filled out a standard application; submitted the required paperwork (teaching philosophy, etc.); waited a few days; and then I was called in for an interview before the hiring committee. This committee included the Humanities Division Chair, the head librarian, a few professors (who had nothing to do with the position itself), the head of the Read Right program, and the Academic Dean.The Committee was very cordial and professional and asked me standard/relevant interview questions (e.g. tell us a little bit about yourself, list qualities an instructor should have, why do you feel literacy is an important, how would you handle a difficult student, etc.) Afterwards, I was set up for an interview with the college's president, which I was told was just a formality, but in all actuality, it was nothing short of a sham interview. He was completely unprepared, had no list of questions to run through, and just asked me random questions came to his head. Most of the time was spent listening to him talk about himself, his wife (a retired school teacher), and the history of the college, and very little time was spent discussing the actual job or asking me relevant questions. Instead, he asked rather prying questions such as where I went to high school; how many siblings I had; where my extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) lived and if they had gone to college (and, if so, what fields had they studied in and what did they currently do for a living); what colleges my parents attended; what degrees my parents had earned; and my parents' current professions. When he found out that one of my parents graduated high school, chose not attend college, and enter directly into the workforce, that seemed to be the proverbial nail in the coffin. From that point on, he acted completely disinterested in me and displayed a cold, uncouth demeanor as he concluded the \"interview.\" About a week later, when I heard nothing about the job, I inquired of my Division Chair, who asked me if the president had even interviewed me. I said yes and she thought that was strange because, during their hiring committee meetings, she claimed he never even indicated that he had talked to me. Needless to say, I didn't get the job but it was easily the worst interview I had ever been on (and I've been on some poorly-conducted interviews before). In retrospect, I can only assume the college president was looking for a particular person, a \"home town girl,\" for lack of a better term, to teach at *his* school. The overall experience was very insulting and left a poor impression on me as far as how the college's top administrators acted and treated others.", "Interview Questions": "The president was insistent in wanting to know about my parents' academic backgrounds, so he asked what degrees they held, where they had gone to school, and what jobs they currently worked."}, {"date": "11 Apr 2017", "title": "Nursing Instructor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Kentucky Community and Technical College System (Edgewood, KY) in Jul 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "I was I nterviewed by a group of 4, Human Resources, administrative assistant, and two professors from another part of the college.\r\nI was required to do a fifteen minute teaching demonstration.
