TLDR; experience was fine overall, but in the end, I was offered $20/hour. I tried to negotiate since the posted range was $19-$24, was told his \"hands were tied,\" and I declined the offer. I first spoke with a recruiter over the phone. It was VERY standard, just asking about availability, schedule, etc. I asked questions about the role, expressed my skills and what I anticipated the role to be like. He was impressed and shared that he thought I'd do very well in the interview. I was scheduled for a virtual interview next. The interviewer was really nice, great experience. She went over what locations I could work in, any time off I might need, etc. Then she asked me a bunch of behavioral interview questions. Tell me about a time when... conflict with a coworker, dealing with a difficult customer, learning a new computer system, etc. There were 4-6 questions. She gave me an opportunity to ask questions and told me they'd be in touch shortly. Later that day I received an email request to submit 5 references into their online system. It sent them an online survey of some sort. That same day, I got a call from the recruiter offering me the job, pending references. I was offered $20/hour. I asked for three business days to think about it and to make sure my references had a chance to respond. I called a couple days later and tried to negotiate a higher wage. The posted range was $19-$24. The minimum required experience was \"none.\" Preferred experience/skills was customer service, working independently, assisting patients check in, insurance verification, etc. I don't have a lot of formal healthcare experience, but I have 9+ years of customer service experience in a variety of roles, 4 years of HR experience, and 2 years tech industry experience. I also have a B.A. I was willing to take $23, maybe even $22, because I wanted to start a long-term career with UCHealth given the growth opportunities. I'm flexible with my schedule and with the location I travel to. I made my case to the recruiter and he said his \"hands were tied.\" I politely declined, it's just not a sustainable wage in this area.

I had to submit written assignments. I was identified as a strong candidate and finalist. Went to be interviewed on-site, traveling across the country; and it was downhill from there. On-site the decision-makers seemed more concerned with my recent job gap and decision to leave a toxic boss and position just short of a year, even though I had so much other experience and had been vetted significantly before being identified as a finalist. Leadership interviews were either superficial and impersonal or very granular. I felt like I got thrown under the bus. And the whole thing was disorganized- technology failing left and right, agenda for the day constantly changing, no warm welcome- I even got dropped off at the wrong hotel and they did not want to pay for my taxi back to the airport. I observed a lot of good and dedicated people but also saw the other side. For example, a top executive reprimanding my potential supervisor instead of greeting me as I waited to meet her, last minute questions about my resume with heavy scribbling in the margins as I fielded what should have been initial screening questions, and  lowball statements  like \u201cwhy would you move here if you think where you live now is beautiful?\u201d It was cat and mouse for sure, and I have several examples about how this played out. A lot of talk about brand and valuing the patient experience  but my recruitment experience was surprisingly poor. Red flags everywhere. My recruiter and the supervisor did not do their due diligence before I arrived or I would not have been answering basic questions about my last job or resume- it should have been higher level or just do not being me forward.  HR got involved post-interview knowing nothing and the people who knew better sandbagged me. I wish I had never interviewed at UCHealth. I took the brunt of their poor internal communication and was not respected or deemed worthy. After all my effort, I did not even get a phone call or any constructive feedback when they decided not to proceed with my candidacy. I received a perfunctory email. I was very disappointed the supervisor could not even give me the courtesy of a phone call. I thought that they cared about people but I must be the exception.

The phone interview was fairly simple asking a little bit about your background and what you knew. I was able to get an in-person interview with the manager and two other lead techs. They started out with a quick tour around their lab which I noticed lots of techs pretty much standing around and talking to each other. It seemed like a very busy and crowded environment. For the interview, they each had questions already printed out on a form. I was to answer 20 questions along with extra technical questions. They did not acknowledge nor give feedback when I responded to their questions and you could feel that if you did not answer the technical questions right, you were pretty much out of consideration. One of the techs interviewing, pretty much expected me to get everything right when in reality no one's a walking encyclopedia. Once the interview was over, they said they would let me know if you are considered for a second interview. The next day I received a request for 5 references on Skill Survey where the references are sent an email to complete a 20 plus survey based on you.  I completed them all and had followed up with them. No answer and no rejection email. As a business, at least let the candidate know they are not considered.
