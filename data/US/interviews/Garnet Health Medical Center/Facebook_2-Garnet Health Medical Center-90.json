Many trade schools/colleges contain talents that would benefit ORMC/CRMC. Timelines do not fit for recent graduates or prospective employees to finish their education and better themselves. There is lack of communication when dealing with the human resource department. This organization has grown too quickly and cannot keep up with the volume of work. The Greater HUDSON VALLEY... but you're not working with local educators, how can you be the Greater Hudson Valley. Please take my review as constructive criticism. SUNY Orange is rated one of the best educators in NYS for nursing and the timelines of graduating or prospective graduating seem to not run parallel for employment opportunities. ORMC and CRMC are known hospitals in the Hudson Valley you should be collaborating for a bridge to employment program, not limiting prospective employees. I would suggest the Human Resource department to be more involved with the community and support local schools.", "Interview Questions": "Very Simple"}, {"date": "1 Jun 2013", "title": "Supervisor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through a recruiter.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Garnet Health Medical Center in Mar 2009", "Interview Descriptions": "I was recruited from an agency.
