The interview will be open ended questions not to exceed 20 questions of one hour.  They will not answer any questions one could have on job pay rate, compensation, incentives whilevemployed.\r\n Overall process was fluid. Biggest negative aspect I took exception to: during the end portion where I got to ask questions, I asked the panel what safety/pandemic policies have been developed to protect the workers and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The response given was that all of the staff are required to wear masks while in the hospital, and social distancing plexi-shields are in in place as needed. While this policy \"sounds nice\", none of the panel of five women wore masks during the interview process at all. I wore a mask to the interview (in the hospital) and was guided by an elder woman worker wearing a mask to the interview room where I met with the other four mask-less women, the worker that entered the room with us removed her mask as she sat. I was surprised for a few moments that this panel would just openly defy this \"safety policy\" in place in the hospital. I'm definitely not sure which is worse, mask-less hospital staff choosing to say a rule that they don't value following, or the lack of courtesy or professionalism to that conveyed during the process.  I physically feel fine, but that interview process just seemed like an hour-long potential exposure session.  I could have just left before starting the interview, but fault me for rehearsing professionalism beforehand.", "Interview Questions": "What skills do you think makes you qualified for this position?\r\nWhat is your biggest strength?\r\nWhat would you consider your biggest weakness?"}, {"date": "7 Dec 2021", "title": "Physical Therapist Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Shannon Medical Center", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview process was very organized and professional .
