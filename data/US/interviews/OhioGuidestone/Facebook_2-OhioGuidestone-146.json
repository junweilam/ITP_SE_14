The company contacted me via phone, took two weeks to schedule a face to face. Completed round one of face to face interviews with three different interviewers. It was a rather simple bunch of questions, really just your average interview. I then waited a month without hearing a word about the position, and then the organization desired a second round of face to face interviews. I complied, and told them they really needed some senior leadership, and that the position they were looking for needed to be upgraded. The interviewers did not disagree. I then spent two weeks trying to negotiate a reasonable salary, and really, this organization is penny wise and pound foolish. The organization doesn't look at efficiency to be gained, only looks at what the price is. All and all, it was easy to spot that the organization is running on an outdated model. Instead of looking at what would be invested, and what would be gained (ROI), it's only about minimizing spend, and that simply doesn't work in the 21st century. Organizations that buy on price only disappeared long ago, and so will this one. The CEO makes $300,000 a year, and is running a 1980's style management model, where you pay employees as little as possible, beat them into the ground, and live with high turnover. The organization lacks zero modern infrastructure, systems and processes. A sharp individual with a Lean or Six Sigma background could take ten percent off of the costs of this organization in 90 days. If you are fresh out of college, this is a good starting point, but expect to be burnt out and out the door in 24 months or less. The benefits are subpar across the board, from time off to medical, all below industry average. The retirement plan takes six years to fully vest, and the average employee life is way less than that, so you can see from the word go that this is a factory mentality, and the thought of managing quality simple isn't there.", "Interview Questions": "What is your next career step?

She then went on to say that even though she felt I was more qualified for the Community Mental Health Worker position, they really wanted someone with a LSW, which is something she knew I didn't have (I just have a Bachelor's Degree). That comment really bothered me and made me feel like she already knew that she wasn't going to move forward with me after the phone interview was over.
