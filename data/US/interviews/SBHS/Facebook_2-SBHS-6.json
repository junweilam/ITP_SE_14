The assessment was easy and contained work place scenarios. If you don't pass then you don't get to move on to the actual interview. Fortunately, I passed and was walked to the hospital where I interviewed with a nursing manager. She asked a couple questions about my resume and work place senarios and then asked if I had any questions. \r\n\r\nAbout a day later I received a call from HR offering me the job.

My interview with HR was fairly easy, just typical interview questions.  There was a timed computerized quiz I had to take.  It was not hard - mainly questions about how you would handle workplace situations.  I did well on that, so I got to move on to the next stage.  The HR representative walked me to the main hospital building, and then I met with two nurse managers who were hiring for their respective units (I had no experience at that point, and was not sure what population I wanted to work with.)  After that, the interview was over.  I heard of another person who got to see the unit during her interview; perhaps I could have gotten a tour if I'd asked.  The next day I got a call from HR offering the position, and I started orientation the next week.  Before orientation, there was a required physical including drug screen.  I was nervous about the physical, but it was easy.
