I had one phone screen with HR then a interview with the VP. I was supposed to hear back in two weeks MAX so after about a week and a half I reached out.  I wouldn't have reach out had the VP not told me they were trying to expedite this process and were looking at a 4-6 week hiring timeline. \r\n\r\n When I finally got ahold of the HR rep I was scolded for reaching out and told they would reach out to me when they were ready. That honestly should have been a huge red flag, but I stuck it out.  Quite literally 6 weeks later I get a request to schedule 4 interviews. The timing was a mess as I was told they were all thirty minutes but apparently some were an hour so I had to shift my work schedule. I was verbally offered week 10 of the process and expected a written offer that week. Week 11 I was verbally offered my minimum salary without any of the incentives we had discussed and when I tried to have a discussion the HR rep said that was \u201cmore than they would normally offer someone with my experience\u201d. I was then called later that day to say they were no longer proceeding with my candidacy. It\u2019s a shame. The position has been open for about 2 years and I understand why.  This interviewing process was a complete nightmare.
