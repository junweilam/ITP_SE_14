It was particularly surprising and disappointing, since ULI is a respected institution with a positive track record and reviews for employment outside of the DC HQ. After I applied, the first response came from someone contracted from ULI to lead the initial screening. She called without notice at 7pm on a weeknight, and asked if I was available for an interview right then. I replied that I was making dinner -- and she responded that she would be happy to call back later that night, at 9:30pm. I was so surprised at the timing of this initial contact, that I agreed to the late evening interview to show some flexibility. She never called back that night. Two days later, she sends me a text, apologizing for not getting in touch, and asking if I was available for an interview right then (again, with no previous notice), or later that afternoon. We agreed to have the first interview the next day (over video chat). But 15 minutes into the interview, she cuts me off in the middle of one of my answers, saying that she had another call she had to make, and asked if we could continue the interview later that afternoon. Needless to say, all of this showed a tremendous lack of respect for my time, and reflected a stunning level of disorganization for someone managing an interview process for an important position to lead ULI's presence in a large city. After finishing this first interview, all further communication came via text either late at night or early in the morning -- with email follow-ups when I didn't immediately respond to a text at 11pm about a follow-up interview.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the process was not as disorganized. However, after ULI's regional leadership scheduled a third round interview in person, the original recruiter alerted me only 45 minutes before the interview that the ULI staff had flight trouble and would be late or possibly unable to make the interview at all. But she suggested I continue with one of ULI's local board members. When I arrived, the process was behind schedule, and I waited for about an hour before communication or updates from anyone. This wasn't necessarily the ULI board member's fault, since he was put into the lead interviewer role with short notice and perhaps wasn't as up-to-speed on the process as the ULI staff that were delayed by the flight issue. But it was just the last problem in a long line of problems throughout the entire process.\r\n\r\nI still respect ULI as an organization -- but this was a horrible process, and should be corrected in the future.", "Interview Questions": "Strengths / weaknesses"}, {"date": "14 Sept 2018", "title": "Associate Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Urban Land Institute", "Interview Descriptions": "I had 3 interviews, one of which was an HR recruiter.

Wasted my life! Crap indeed!!!\r\n\r\nNever gave me any final result. The interviews seemed like only for collecting candidates\u2019 ideas of how to grow their business. \r\n\r\nFew months ago, I applied for a job and the line manager contacted me from Singapore for arranging an online interview. \r\n\r\nA few days later, during the interview, she asked me about my background, how to attract customers for ULI, etc. and said they hope someone can start the job as soon as possible. She talked very nice with enthusiasm, saying if I had any questions, very welcomed to ask. If I passed the first interview, the second one would be in ULI\u2019s Shanghai office. In short, her words would make you feel she was such a nice supervisor as well as a very easy-going person to work with. I did believe and raised relevant questions but in her email, instead of answering me directly, she said would do, however never. \r\n\r\nAfter one week, she contacted me again for the second interview \u2013 a quiz instead of a face-to-face interview. I was asked to read brochures and analyze their membership DATA. Quite amazing!!! \r\n\r\nThen, after another more than three weeks, I finally met two people in a mini, crowded and messy office (ULI seems doesn\u2019t have an official office in China). The working environment looked very unpleasant. They asked me many questions. Most of them were about how to grow their business, attract customers, what do I think of their this and that.

Cited connectivity issues again.\r\n\r\nI get that this is an internship, but the interview questions weren't even half-baked; other internships at the Master's level that I've interviewed for (and received offers from) at least asked about prior experience and classroom experiences.\r\n\r\nShe let me know that the position I applied for had been filled a while ago, but she would put me in contact with someone else in a different department for a second interview.
