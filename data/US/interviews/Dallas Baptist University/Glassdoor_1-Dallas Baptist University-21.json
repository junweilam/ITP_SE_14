The Information Technology dept. requires students to submit the application, personality test results, class schedule, unofficial transcript, and resume to the Support office. \r\n\r\nI was interviewed by 4 separate staff members over the 4 weeks after my submission.\r\n\r\nThe first interview was with 2 members of Support staff. They were the managers I would be working for if I was hired. It was good to meet them early on and get to know what the job would be like.\r\n\r\nThe second interview was with the associate vice president of the department. He was very relaxed and encouraging. He wanted to know my background and what I enjoyed about school and things of this sort. He was friendly and helped the interview feel stress free.\r\n\r\nThe third and final interview was with the vice president of the department. This was the most difficult interview since he is kind but difficult to read. I was fairly relaxed until he started asking hypothetical questions about my personality test including one question that was phrased as though there was a correct answer.  However the interview went well and I was hired at the close of it.\r\n\r\nI was able to start working the following week after filling out some minimal paperwork for payroll.", "Interview Questions": "I was asked if I would rather read a book or a poem on the last day of my life. It caught me by surprise and I answered a book to the surprise of the vice president who expected teh latter answer due to my personality assessment.  It was a bit discomforting after the interview since the question seemed to imply there was right answer and I had answered book since I am a speed reader and I could read a book in a day without issue."}]]
