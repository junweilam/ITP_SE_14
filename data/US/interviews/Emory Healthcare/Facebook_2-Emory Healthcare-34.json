Eventually, the two interviewers ran out of questions and started asking about random topics; many moments of silence occurred. I tried to make the interview interesting by asking questions, but by the end of the interview, it was clear that the interviewers lacked interest. They informed me that I should hear back from them after the holidays.  As I left, I saw that other interviewees had been sitting at a table next to where I was interviewing; I guess it was  interview day at Starbucks.   I never heard back from either interviewer.

That means you have to be on your toes with answers and also be prepared with other answers in the event your answer was given by another interviewee.

They ask you a series of basic, stereotypical interview questions that really have nothing to do with the position (they write down all of your answers while you are talking so it helps to have more than 10 seconds worth of stuff to say). I remember being asked about a time when I worked in a team where someone wasn't pulling his weight, greatest strengths/weaknesses, a time when something didn't go as planned. A lot of questions seemed very similar so I felt like I was using similar stories for a lot of the questions but it didn't really seem to matter.
