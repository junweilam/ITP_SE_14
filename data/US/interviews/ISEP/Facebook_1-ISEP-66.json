After submitting my cover letter and resume, I was contacted by the HR director within a week.

Afterwards, she quickly responded to schedule a follow-up interview the following week with my main supervisor as well as two other future teammates on the advising and program management team. Not even as much as a week later, I was given an offer letter.
