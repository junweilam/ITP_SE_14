The HR woman was knowledgeable, personable, and great to talk to. A lot of HR people sound like they hate their jobs but she was very outgoing and enthusiastic. About a week later I was invited to an in-person interview with the hiring manager. The interview was very casual and lasted around 30 minutes. The hiring manager seemed like she would be a great person to work for. I had an offer pending with a different company. I let Children's Hospital know this. At first they seemed eager to move the process along with me. I was asked for 3 references. The references had to fill out an online questionnaire. After that, I was asked for my transcripts. Then, I received an email telling me they had another interview to do later that week and that they didn't want me to miss out on another opportunity. I quickly responded back that I was still interested in the position I applied to and would like to remain in consideration. The hiring manager responded back positively and said she was glad. I foolishly misread the entire situation and took her at face value. I ended up declining my first offer in anticipation of receiving an offer with Children's. Unfortunately, a week passed and I emailed the hiring manager for an update. Moments later the HR woman messaged me and told me they were going with an internal candidate. It felt horrible and left a bad taste in my mouth about Children's Hospital. I would have much preferred transparency about the internal candidate; if I had known, I wouldn't have declined my first offer because we all know the internal candidate almost always wins. I also disliked that they bothered my three references and asked for transcripts when they had an internal candidate pending.

The interview process was lengthy and somewhat confusing.  It seemed every individual I met with had a separate agenda and it was as if there was little communication going on behind the scenes between the multiple departments.  This, of course, made interviewing quite difficult as I found myself repeating often or leaving something out; like a question, concern, observation, etc.  The company very much expects those who interview to be more \"in the know\" about their facility.  This is advantageous for a Wisconsin-raised or internal candidate but not so much for external candidates. Overall the atmosphere and culture of the company seemed respectable, dedicated, and lively which was very refreshing.  Everyone is very knowledgeable and truly passionate about patient/pediatric care.  Throughout the interview process I was frequently told \"you're their top candidate\" however a day after relaying my salary request to my recruiter I was told they had offered the position to another candidate and she had accepted.
