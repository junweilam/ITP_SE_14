They described the position and asked just about the same questions as during the phone interview.

Easy enough since they seemed to be interested in a bubbly, outgoing personality. She immediately offered an in-person interview which she promised to call back and schedule by the end of the day. Three days later I had not heard from her, so I had to contact her. \r\n\r\nThe email I received to confirm my in-person interview was typo-ridden, which doesn't normally bother me. Except she misspelled her director's name, whom I was to call upon arrival to the site. So I essentially called the director (my interviewer) by the wrong name over the phone for a job that is heavily phone-based. Awesome.\r\n\r\nTypical interview with friendly office and staff. I was offered a group interview, but was notified a day before that they wish me luck on my career search elsewhere. \r\n\r\nIt got interesting when out of the blue three months later they call for a group interview which I attended. I was the only person who showed up. The HR rep seemed rushed and unfocused making me feel like I had completely wasted my afternoon. She concluded by saying that she would review my past interviews and contact me (aka \"Why didn't we like you before?\"). I received no contact whatsoever even after a interview thank you note and follow-up inquiry.

I submitted my resume without having seen a job description, so I didn't know that I was under the min. experience level requested.  Initially I had to complete an online screening test, consisting of math (finance story problems) and a personality test.  Next, I had to send a follow-up email and leave a voicemail before getting an interview set up.  The HR rep later later told me that they want to see persistence and follow-up in their applicants.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the interview was with two lower management members.  They were suspicious that my desire to help people would interfere with my capacity to excel in the sales aspects of this position, which, if you haven't already guessed from reading the other reviews, is actually what the position is focused on.  The second part of the interview was with an upper management member who seemed disinterested in the whole thing.  Questions in both parts were very standard \"corporate interview\" fare.  These people take the idea of selling an education very seriously.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, the HR rep contacted me and said they had gone with another candidate who met the experience criteria, but referred me to a different campus location to interview for a similar position.  This position, \"High School Admissions Recruiter\", appears to be the exact same job as the regular \"Admissions Advisor\" except that you specifically target high schoolers and their parents.  This position has less of an experience requirement, so they can pay you less money for doing essentially the same job.\r\n\r\nI went to a different Chicago location to interview the next day, and was told that the man I was supposed to interview with had left the office for the day already because there had been a miscommunication.  Instead, I met only with the HR representative, and was told I'd have to come back on yet another day in order to meet with the man who had left the office early.  I felt this was rather unprofessional and was annoyed by the whole thing.  Everything seemed very disorganized in the offices there (downtown location appeared to be much more professional).  \r\n\r\nBy the time I left, I decided I have no desire to work there and try and \"sell\" kids on an education that they can't actually afford.  I was initially drawn to interview with them because of the 39K starting salary and great benefits, which could really help me out.  The High School Admissions Rep starts at 35K, though, and while it would be worth it to me to do certain other jobs for that salary (I'm a recent college grad and it's hard to get that much at entry level in this economy) I just wouldn't be able to stomach doing this job.  \r\n\r\nIf you do decide to pursue this job, my advice is to follow-up a lot - they're looking for sales people, and will judge you on how persistent you are in selling yourself.", "Interview Questions": "How do you define hard work?"}, {"date": "14 Sept 2010", "title": "Administrative Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 week.\u00a0I interviewed at DeVry University (Chicago, IL) in Jul 2010", "Interview Descriptions": "Received a phone call and immediately had a phone interview, a few weeks after filling out an online application.
