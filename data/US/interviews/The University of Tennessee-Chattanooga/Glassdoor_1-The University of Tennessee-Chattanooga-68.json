First round was a video call with a search committee. They simply asked a series of questions (why are you interested, what can you bring, etc.). Second round was a few weeks later, all day event at the university. Ate breakfast with the search team and potential coworkers, had an interview with search team again (same/similar questions as before). After that, I had an interview with the department head, a brief campus tour, then headed to lunch with the director. After lunch we came back to campus, I had to give a brief presentation on an initiative I was passionate about, then I finished my day with a debrief with the director.
