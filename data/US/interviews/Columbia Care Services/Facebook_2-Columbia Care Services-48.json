Applications are submitted online.  They call you, without any sense of what other facilities are doing, so unlike Cascadia, they take multiple applications.  I had turned down one job because of the very high risk at that facility for assault - the person interviewing me or their work partner had been assaulted that week, but a couple days later, I was called by another facility for an interview.  Interviews are casual, they chat with you.  Usually two people interviewing me.  They are all different, some interviewers talk your ear off, some ask questions.  They want to know what you would do if a client refused meds, or was yelling at you.  They ask you questions as though you'd been doing that exact job for years before. You are told there is little opportunity for advancement, start at eleven, cap out at twelve an hour. They have training, so that plus experience is the good part.  They seem to decide fairly quickly, but I'm not happy with how they did it.  At one facility, they told me they would call me the next day, that they wanted to hire me but they had to sort out the schedule, and then we could confirm the days they'd be offering me.  No response.  I called the only number I had, the co-interviewer's number, they finally called back and said they were no longer associated with the organization.  The second facility offered me the job on the phone the day after the interview, and the day after that, withdrew their job offer.  No explanation, and wouldn't answer my questions about why they were withdrawing the offer.  I always appreciate knowing what the problem is, but all they said was \"at will\" employer.", "Interview Questions": "None, really, other than they want to know what you'd do in this case or that, as though you already were trained and worked there."}, {"date": "22 Mar 2014", "title": "Residential Associate II Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "N/A", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Columbia Care Services in Aug 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Receive a phone call. Talk about your qualifications. Go in. Talk to one person. Go in again, talk to multiple people. Your interviewer will either hire you on the spot, or take you through a series of questions that presume incompetent staff and situations to deal with said staff's incompetence. If you are going in for a staff position, the questions assume your job is more serious than anyone else really thinks it is, so try to act like a phd even though you will be spending most of your day cleaning up feces. Don't let on that you understand this fact.", "Interview Questions": "These questions speak to the arrogance of the management here. If they cannot use counseling principles when managing their own staff I can only imagine how their residents are treated. I also can only imagine how pervasive of a problem this is through out the whole company."}]]
