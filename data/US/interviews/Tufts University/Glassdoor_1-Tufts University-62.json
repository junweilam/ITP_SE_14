This did not inspire confidence, but I was interested in the job, so I stuck with it.   I was told very different things about the interview schedule and process from the HR rep compared to the employees on the hiring committee, which again did not inspire confidence.  But overall, the first interview went fine, and we quickly scheduled a time for the next round a couple of weeks later.  After 5 pm on the evening before my second round interview I received a voice message from HR that my interview *for the following morning* would need to be 2 hours longer than previously planned, and that if all went well, a third round interview would likely follow in several weeks' time.  Very little explanation and certainly no apologies were offered as part of this message.  I withdrew my candidacy that night.   \r\nI'm now happily employed at a company that values the time of its employees, and treats job-seekers with respect.
