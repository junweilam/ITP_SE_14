He explained the job to me, and did not ask extensive questions (I was expecting to have to explain myself much more). At the end he asked if this was something I was interested in, which obviously I was. He set up a 1 on 1 interview for later that week. I came in and spoke mainly with him, though he did introduce me to some other members of the lab. Again, this was very casual. After checking my references, I received an offer from the school, pending a check on my degree status. That went through very quickly and I started the job in a matter of weeks.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about your previous work"}, {"date": "14 Oct 2012", "title": "Clinical Policy Analyst Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 months.\u00a0I interviewed at UMass Chan Medical School (Boston, MA) in Apr 2009", "Interview Descriptions": "The hiring process is painfully slow and will seem to have stopped.  After initial communication several weeks may lapse until the candidate here's from the employer again.  Often there is a disconnect between the hiring managers and the HR dept.  HR at this organization is TERRIBLE.  If you get to interviews, you'll likely meet with your future colleagues who are mostly bright, friendly, and underpaid.  Demonstrate that you're a good team player and detailed oriented.  Striking the right balance of reserved and out-going is key.  Good to air on the side of reserved.", "Interview Questions": "MassHealth is the biggest client of the organization.  Do your homework on MassHealth and  what comprises policy making.  You may get a question like, \"What would you do if you had a difficult client with whom you had to work?\"  "}]]
