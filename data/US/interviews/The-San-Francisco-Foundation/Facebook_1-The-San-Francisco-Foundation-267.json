They also seemed very disorganized as each meeting had its set of issues. Twice the zoom or teams links didn\u2019t work, so I ended up providing mine. For my  panel interview they forgot to invite me, so I was receiving calls asking where I was. These were all red flags for me, but I rolled with it. Ultimately I got through the entire process of what seemed like 5+ rounds, with each round getting positive feedback. At the end I get  a generic response that I was ultimately not a good fit without offering any feedback when politely asked. \n\nThe one awkward moment was the panel touting their commitment to diversity and equity. But then they took a pause and said admittedly it\u2019s not reflected in the panel as they were all white middle aged folks. It was both a funny and sad moment.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you interested in working at SFF?"}, {"date": "15 Jul 2021", "title": "Associate Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at The San Francisco Foundation", "Interview Descriptions": "Detailed.
