After sending my portfolio on Monday, the recruiter asked me to confirm an entire day 5 person interview schedule on short notice.  This was unexpected, and impractical while working full time.  I asked if we could schedule this step at another time, maybe taking a half day instead of a whole day, and the recruiter said she'd get back to me.

Her advice was spot on.  My initial phone interview was then rescheduled the night of due to a conflict in schedule with the hiring manager.  The phone interview was rescheduled for the following day.  The phone interview with the hiring manager consisted of mostly talking about my background, and why I was leaving my current employer.  At the end of the interview he said he needed to follow up with the rest of his team and that he had a few more phone interviews to conduct before he could make a decision.
