Then, shortly after that, I got an email from someone in their HR department saying that the candidate had fallen through and they were interested in speaking with me. I almost missed the email because that is highly unusual to send out rejections only to have to rescind them. Nevertheless, I spoke with the HR person a few days later, and she then said that she would like me to speak to the hiring manager. I interviewed with the hiring manager for about 45 mins about a week later. It was a fine conversation, and the interview questions were fairly standard. The hiring manager then said that she would like to move me to the writing assignment round and would send me the prompts by the end of the day. This is where the interview process went sour for me. I was sent the prompts as promised on a Monday afternoon, and she requested that I return the completed project by Wednesday. First of all, the prompt had a typo in it, which was confusing enough that I needed to follow up on it. This put me in an awkward position to have to call out my potential new supervisor. Second, the deadline absolutely did not fit with my schedule. I had a full day of meetings the next day and two sick kids at home. I have seen other employers ask candidates to give a 48-hour window that aligns with their schedule, and I find this to be both considerate and equitable. I sent in my completed assignment by the deadline, knowing it wasn't my best work, but it was all I could do given the time constraints. I never heard a word back from the hiring manager. Not even a thank you for completing the assignment. After two weeks, I received the same generic rejection email I had received in the beginning. The best part... there was a typo in the rejection letter! I found this to be in such poor taste. As a hiring manager, you should always connect directly with people who you have brought this far into the interview process. I can handle rejection, and I also know that I probably could've done a better writing assignment, but receiving a poorly written generic email is a pathetic way to treat candidates. In the Glassdoor reviews, someone mentioned, \"If you see red flags in the interview process, pay attention.\" The Glassdoor reviews were so bad from employees I almost didn't move forward in the search, and now I wish I hadn't. The one positive thing I will say is that I appreciated how swiftly they moved during the interview stage.

Completed a 20min call with the recruiter who outlined the position responsibilities and asked me a few questions about my experience. She also outlined the compensation range which seemed relatively low, and stated there would be no room for negotiation (not sure if that's true or not). I was then scheduled for a panel interview with four people. Everyone seemed really genuine and down to earth, and there weren't any curveball questions. A week after the interview, I received an email from the recruiter who said the team thought the interview went really well and asked how I was feeling about the position. I replied letting her know that I, too, felt it went really well but despite this, I ended up receiving a rejection email about two weeks later. That was disappointing, but I had gotten the sense in the interview that the team may have felt I was a bit overqualified for the role, so that's my best guess as to why it didn't work out.
