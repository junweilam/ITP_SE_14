She liked me so I was invited back to meet with her and a few members of the development team and then the CEO. The other staff were great and so was the CEO. It seems like they are doing really great work there.  From the first meeting the CDO described herself as \"intense\" and I should have taken that more seriously. She began calling or texting me almost every day. She told me that I was the only and top candidate at the time but she was worried about how I would do \"not having my hands in all aspect of development\" since my previous position was a Development Director.  When I asked about leadership opportunities she made it VERY clear that she was a Chief and that she was in charge. Later I found out from the CEO that the position would sit on the org's leadership team so I am not sure why the CDO wouldn't have just responded to me with that. She then called each of my references (including my boss at the time). Each of the told me it felt like she was trying to figure out what was wrong with  me and didnt want to hear anything positive. She described me as \"aggressive\"  and \"loud\" during my panel interview to my current employer... Yes. this is a girls serving organization and I can't really think of too many more sexist things to say about a person who was interviewing. She event offended one of my references who was a donor to my past org. When she finally decided she wanted me, I told her that I would need some time to get back to her  so I could go to one final interview with a different org (she knew I was interviewing other places) she was completely unprofessional. She was gas lighting my decision to interview with this other organization and pushing me for details about the other role I was interviewing for and bullying me to take the job.  She even texted me the morning of my interview with the other company letting me know she  was hoping I would get the clarity I needed. I ended up not getting the job with the other org AND declining the offer with Girls Inc.
