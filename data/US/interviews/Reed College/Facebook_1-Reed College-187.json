I was told I was being interviewed, but every week a new email came saying \"sorry! it's going to happen next week!\". \r\n\r\nI was finally interviewed around June 15th, and the interview process itself was fine, until meeting with HR. I was under the impression that three candidates were interviewing for three positions, and I found out via HR (and not from the people interviewing me) that there were actually two positions available. HR also asked me \u201cif I could press you for a concern about this position, what would it be?\u201d and after answering I was completely shot down and not even listened to.\r\n\r\nAfter interviewing, I was told \"oh, you'll hear next week!\" to \"oh, you'll hear in two weeks\" until finally \"you will hear via phone this weekend\". Understandably, I was stressed out that entire weekend expecting a phone call, until the weekend had passed and I still didn't hear. On that Monday I emailed asking for a update, only to receive no response. That Tuesday, I finally found out via phone at the end of the work day I was not being offered the job. The people interviewing me made it seem pretty clear that I was likely to receive this job offer, until I was kept waiting on the hook from March until July only to not get an offer.

Also, this was all in the \"COVID-19\" era too - so keep that in mind. \r\n\r\nI applied and they were fairly quick to get back with me via email where they scheduled a 30 minute phone screen. That was a pretty typical and easy. \r\n\r\nI then moved on to the next round, which was 1 hour zoom interview. That also was fairly typical and easy, mostly behavioral questions but also some questions about diversity and working styles. A lot of the questions were thought provoking, which I appreciated.\r\n\r\nI then moved on to the next round, which was a 4 hour zoom interview process (Again, COVD times).  \r\n\r\nIn between that, they offered to do an in person tour of the campus and the department I'd be working in. I was a little hesitant, because of COVID, but I really wanted the job, so I risked it and did the in person tour. That was about 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThen came the 4 hour zoom call/interview. That went okay. It was about four 45 minute interviews with different people and one 30 minute interview. You meet with people you'd be working alongside as well as an HR person who went over all their benefits, which can be found on their website. Most of the people didn't seem prepared to interview me, so I had to ask A LOT of questions most of the time, which is fine, if not repetitive. \r\n\r\nTotal time spent with Reed college about about 7-1/2 hours. I did not get the job and they let me know via email which was a HUGE disappointment. A call would have been nice and way more professional considering all the time I took to interview with them. I asked for feedback and they told me they had zero feedback for me but I should be happy I made it to the final round (not sure what I'll do with that accomplishment?). \r\n\r\nReed claims they do this long winded interview process out of \"tradition\". For one, as a candidate, there is nothing more stressful as someone who is currently employed than trying to come up with excuses as to why you'll be out of the office so much (7-1/2 hours, basically a full work day). Secondly, it was really strange to me that they had me meet with the HR person. Again, all their benefit information is online. I'd think anyone applying/interviewing with a company would do research beforehand. This seemed like a giant waste of time for not only the candidate, but also the HR department. \r\n\r\nIn short, Reed has a lovely campus with some lovely people.

I am somewhat relieved I didn't get an offer because the process really put a bad taste in my mouth.\r\n\r\nI submitted my cover letter, resume, and online application, and was emailed a day later to schedule a short phone interview with the search committee chair. The interview was a basic screening of my experience and interest in the role, which was quick and easy.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, I was invited to an on-campus interview. This was a typical 45-minute panel style interview with a few current employees - great, no problem. A week went by and I was emailed again and asked to schedule a 30-minute phone interview with another person who couldn't be present during my previous on-campus interview. Fine.\r\n\r\nAnother week later, I was invited for another on-campus interview, which was scheduled 3 weeks out. This was a half-day interview, which is pretty typical in the higher ed field. Usually, you are invited to campus to meet with some of the people you'd be working with while in the role. In my previous experience with these, I have been invited for lunch, coffee, or at the very least a campus tour. These interviews are generally two-way, in that you are also interviewing the staff and the campus to see if it is a good fit for you. This was not the case at Reed. \r\n\r\nMost of my 5 hour half-day interview consisted of sitting in a basement conference room fielding the same behavioral questions over and over again by different campus members and stakeholders. I met with 7 different groups of people, there were no scheduled breaks, no time to grab a snack or glass of water. 5 hours without a scheduled break is cruel. A few of my interviewers mentioned they were filling in for someone else and hadn\u2019t seen my resume/didn\u2019t know anything about me. 5 hours later, I was shaking from hunger and mentally exhausted. I was not shown the office where I might be working, or anywhere else on campus. I was told a decision would be made in about a week. There was no real closure to my interview, and I was not walked out. \r\n\r\nTwo weeks of silence went by and I emailed the search committee chair to check in and see if they made a decision or have an update on their timeline. No response. Another week went by, and I finally received a generic email letting me know that they had chosen another candidate. I replied promptly with gratitude, and to see if they had any feedback about my interview and what qualifications I might have been lacking. No response. \r\n\r\nI was very put off by this entire process and the way I was treated both during and after my interviews. Our higher education community is very small, and I'm sure our paths will probably cross again, so I am very perturbed by this behavior.
