You get a feeling that management is pretty relaxed. The next part is a design challenge. This is a bit more nerve racking as you'll be asked to solve a problem on the spot.

This can be where things go sour - as they did for me. \r\n\r\nMeeting the team was fairly relaxed and informal. It's strictly with the team and no manager in a closed room.

Interviews were a little odd.  First round was a 10 minute \"lightning round\", from there they'd choose people to go to round 2.  In the time between the two rounds, there were tours of the facility with some cool presentations on the work they're doing.  I wasn't selected for round 2,  but it wasn't the fact that I didn't advance that's leading to this negative review, it was my experience during the interview itself...\r\n\r\nI'll skip around a bit and address the one positive point: The tour.  It was really informative and the people conducting the demos were great.  I had a good conversation with the guy who was running my tour and had the opportunity to talk about some of the things that they're working on related to both NLP and identifying gaps in services performed vs what was billed, we discussed how there appears to be an opportunity to tie the billing thing into supply chain.  All in all, the tour was a definitely a positive experience.\r\n\r\nAs for the 10 minute interview, while I have no doubt that my not being selected for the second round was entirely on me, there were a few things that really bothered me about how it was conducted.\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd overheard one of the interviewers talking to another about trying to be \"more intimidating\".  I'd initially thought that they were kidding around, but both interviewers were relatively stone faced the entire time.  I'm not sure if the intent is to see how candidates perform under pressure, but I think it's counterproductive.  It is, after all, a candidate's first impression of potential coworkers or superiors.  It made me think that all subsequent encounters would be more challenge and confrontation than collaboration.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the two people conducting the interviews only introduced themselves after I did and when they did, only gave their first names.  No titles or responsibilities.  I knew of one based on my research of the TDC prior to going, but I don't like the idea of having to give a pitch without at least some context around the audience.\r\n\r\nThe third problem I had -- and this was really the most irritating -- was that about midway through, one of the interviewers picked up their phone and appeared to start casually flipping through texts, emails, or whatever.  If you're only giving candidates ten minutes, give them the entire ten minutes.  I'll concede that I'm probably not the most interesting person in the world (as I mentioned, both interviewers were expressionless throughout the time I was in the room), but if you've truly lost interest and don't want to proceed, don't just tune out, end the interview.  I could respect that.  I wouldn't like it, but I'd respect it.  \r\n\r\nAfter about an hour (during which time I went on the tour noted above) they announced the candidates who were selected for the next round.  As I mentioned, I wasn't selected.  There were some HR reps on hand to discuss other opportunities within UPMC for those folks like me who didn't move on.  The recruiter I spoke with told me that there are quite a few openings where my background in big data, analytics, etc... would be beneficial, but I absolutely have no interest in pursuing any other jobs at UPMC.\r\n\r\nIn summary,  the facility and the work that they're doing seem really great and appear to add real value, but based on those few minutes I spent in the interview, I've really soured on the UPMC brand.  In fact, I'm so annoyed over that phone thing that I've been mulling over getting a different PCP outside of their system.  I doubt I'll actually end up doing that, but let it serve to illustrate how utterly dissatisfied I am over the encounter:  I do not want to be their customer anymore.", "Interview Questions": "It was more of an opportunity to sell yourself for ten minutes with a few leading questions.

The center is used as the research and development area to pursue and bring new products to market.

This is a non-traditional corporate environment where one day you may work late in the evening while another you may have a shorter day to re-energize. \r\n\r\nWhen you submit your interview it will be reviewed to see if it even remotely qualifies for an interview. This may not be too much of a worry for you as it seems the farm more people through than necessary. You will be introduced to the staff present and given an overview of the work that is performed at the center. The interview consists of a series of speed interviews where you need to sell yourself in the first 30 - 60 seconds and explain why you are a good fit for the job. Be prepared for this and you will repeat it for multiple people. After the first round the team will decide who merits more in-depth interviews. At the more in-depth interviews you will be probed for your technical knowledge and how well you know your material. Expect behavioral as well. \r\n\r\nInitial contact was through e-mail followed by my personal call to the senior technical recruiter who was male and basically a speed talker. The technical recruiter should have scheduled a set amount of time to provide candidates more information. Not sure the speed talk was necessary but it gives you clues as to what to expect in the future. The recruiter was slightly rude near the end but as I mentioned this could have been avoided with a scheduled call. \r\n\r\nOverall it seems interesting but in the end I did not pursue.", "Interview Questions": "Be sure to have a good day and be at the top of your game.

I  got a call back, I would say, to weeks later (a few friends of mine applied using me as a reference and their call back times varied, but I would say give them a call after 3 weeks).  I'm not sure how the process works for MT's.  But as an SNA they actually ask you what your mental health interest is.  You meet the recruiter, and then they tell you who you are meeting with.  I interviewed on three floors.  Your interview consists of a few different parts.  One is a sit down with the NCM, or ANCM of the floor.  They ask you typical questions, basically autobiographical questions, and the \"why do you want to work here\" types of questions.  Then they give you a tour of the floor and tell you a bout the job.  They also ask if you have any questions.  \r\n\r\nADVICE: \r\n\r\nMy advice would be don't be nervous.  The interview process for an SNA position at WPIC isn't tough at all.  It's basically like \"Does this person seem like they would be a good fit? Do they seem excited to work in the MH industry?\" etc.  Remember, you have to have your ACT 33/34, FBI, and PA child abuse clearances in order to work at WPIC (UPMC makes it easy to get all of these).  When you come back from the interviews they will actually ask you what floor you like the best, tell them! They really want to know!  I found out later that the NCM's typically quarrel over who gets who, so telling them is a plus.  UPMC seems to like assertiveness, and people who are themselves.  Remember this is WPIC, it's a mental health facility, so being personable is also a plus.  \r\n\r\nDon't be scared if there are other people. I got nervous and thought it was a group interview.  It's not!   When I went there were two other people interviewing for an SNA position.  Not sure if they were interviewing on the same floors, but I know two out of the three of us got hired.  \r\n\r\nLastly, BE YOURSELF!  Since this is a student position, employers want to hear about school, make sure you focus on your major and how it applies to the job. \r\n\r\nGood luck!", "Interview Questions": "The \"interview\" is more just like a get to know you chat.
