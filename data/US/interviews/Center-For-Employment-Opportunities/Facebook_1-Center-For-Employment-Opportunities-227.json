The hiring manager was very transparent and expectations of what was expected of the successful candidate were laid out. Significant time was set aside for me to ask questions. Lastly, I had a panel interview, which like the first two rounds, went very smoothly. I sent in my references and received an offer shortly after. The recruiter is the one scheduling the interviews and doing the reaching out, and she was incredible. An interview tips sheet is provided before every round, which was helpful.
