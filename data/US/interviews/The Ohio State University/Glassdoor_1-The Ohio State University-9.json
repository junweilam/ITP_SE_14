Shortly after the post closing date, I was excited to hear from a recruiter. We scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview was short, sweet, and pleasant. After that, my info was passed to the hiring manager for review. I was thrilled to hear that I was picked to interview.  \r\n\r\nI was informed who would be in my panel interview (names, titles) which helped, so that I could look everyone up on LinkedIn. Panel interviews are cringe-worthy (and cruel in my opinion), and I personally don't do as well when there are 3+ people. In this case, there were 6 people (including the recruiter).  I understand that hiring managers like to do this because they want the opinions of other people who\u2019ll work with the person, but I feel it was done to excess here. Only barely 3 of those people really should've been there, it seems. \r\n\r\nI will say, the parking situation is horrendous. I was given a map showing which lots to park in, only to arrive and find the closest lot full. I found openings in the farther lot, and had to figure out how to pay for parking. This involved downloading the Parkmobile app and creating an account, etc. (Would\u2019ve been nice to be told of in advance, so that I could've had it done prior.) After all that, I had to walk a 1/2 mile (not exaggerating) in heels and a skirt, in cold weather. Salt in the wound: when I reached the building, I saw Visitor Parking right outside, which I could've used, but wasn\u2019t told about. \r\n\r\nOnce inside, my recruiter greeted me, and we stood waiting for our giant meeting room to free up. The interviewers started to trickle in and stand with us awkwardly. I was trying to thaw out, plus ignore the pain in my knees from the walk, while trying to be professional and social, and not say anything stupid - fun stuff! Usually when you interview, you don't stand around socializing at first, so this was a new one. \r\n\r\nOf course, once the room freed up and we got started, it broke the ice and we got on track. The interview felt a bit...forced...as panel interviews often do. They went around the table, each person getting to ask a scripted question. A few of the interviewers seemed a little bored to be there (I don't think they thought they needed to be there either).\r\n\r\nBy the end of the time slot, I felt really good. I felt like I had warmed everyone up and really jived with the hiring manager especially. The recruiter escorted me out, and she said they were finishing interviews by EOW and she'd be in touch next week, etc. \r\n\r\nI did all the proper thank-you's, and was so hopeful the next week for my phone to ring. It did not.  I emailed the recruiter politely (after about 7 or 8 business days) for any updates on the decision. No reply. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I was in the dark - no clue if they\u2019d decided to not hire after all, had to delay the hiring, etc. I read from other Glassdoor reviewers that they experienced the same, only to get a call a few months later that they got the role. I doubted that would happen here, but you never know. I decided to discontinue following up, and just let it go. The recruiter had been in fast, open contact with me previously, so I knew that if they wanted to reach me, they would.\r\n\r\nI only know that the position is filled because the status of my application finally changed to \u201cPosition Filled\u201d in the OSU employment portal. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m really disappointed in OSU. I couldn't even get the respect of getting an email back from my recruiter in response to my follow-up - not even some canned email saying, \"Oh sorry we had so many great candidates to choose from, and it was a tough decision, but we decided to go with someone else.\" To be cut off like that, with no reply at all, is very disrespectful and unprofessional. Especially after I've taken my time to be there, paid 5 bucks in parking, walked a mile total in the cold (wearing heels!), and sat through a panel interview.

Obviously you should return to your hateful workplace even if you don't think it's the best thing for your new baby) and asked me where I saw myself in 5 years, which I thought was a bizarre question for a gopher job (I see myself as senior gopher?).

I am young, female, and engaged, so OF COURSE he must think the next thing on my list is to have a bunch of babies.  (It's not, but so what if it were?  Does he think it's his right to require that people not have children?)  He also wanted to know whether I had problems with my \"attendance\", which I found insulting.  I explained that in a year's time I had taken 1.5 days of vacation.  After being asked about my qualications/background I was told that I was more than qualified, that \"anyone could do this job\".
