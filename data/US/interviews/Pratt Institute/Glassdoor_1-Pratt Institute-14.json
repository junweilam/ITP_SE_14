Both times, I've made it to the final candidate rounds of interviews, and both times, the final experiences have left a bad taste in my mouth. \r\n\r\nThe hiring managers are quite thorough in their interviews -- you will often undergo a phone screening and then an initial interview where you are asked for more specific details about your resume and work experience, which then begins to move into your values and work style. This last time, I was interviewed for a writer position in the department and my final interview round was with the three executives I would be writing for (not working directly with), who conducted the interview interrogation style. I felt like I was taking a test or defending a thesis. \r\n\r\nDespite that, I was still excited for the potential the position held and the environment -- this also despite the pitifully low-balled salary the Institute was offering.  After numerous correspondences with the hiring manager, and then reaching the end of the interview process, I wrote once more to inquire about my candidacy either way. My message was met with silence, which seemed odd after everything else. The following week, I received a generic form letter in the mail notifying me that they had \"chosen another candidate . . . \" whose experience better matched the role.  \r\n\r\nDisgusting. \r\n\r\nAfter multiple rounds of interviews, and rapport build, it would have been perfectly fine for the hiring manager to reply to my email inquiry that I had not been chosen for the position. It would have left me with a better impression of the Institute, rather than feeling like I will never apply for a post there again, although they obviously find my skills and personality a potential match. \r\n\r\nHiring managers need to understand and respect that candidates also invest a great deal of time and effort into the interview process, and while feedback like \"what you can do better\" or \"why we didn't choose you\" isn't obligatory, a human touch is for candidates you were seriously considering.", "Interview Questions": "N/A -- felt very specific to each candidate and based on my specific resume, skill set, work samples"}, {"date": "6 Feb 2014", "title": "Administrative Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Pratt Institute", "Interview Descriptions": "It took forever to be called after application submission.
