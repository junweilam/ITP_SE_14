I clarified that they were looking to reschedule the previous interview, and after checking with the hiring manager, the recruiter affirmed that it was indeed a reschedule. The call was scheduled for the third time, and once again, I never received a call. Approximately a week later, I received an automated e-mail indicating I had not been selected for the position. Everyone I interacted with, via telephone and e-mail, was very polite, but there seemed to be little to no communication between the recruiter(s) and the hiring manager.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond what was expected of you."}, {"date": "7 Aug 2017", "title": "Research Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at AdventHealth Tampa (Tampa, FL) in Apr 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "It was pretty informal.

I had over three years experience on a very busy cardiac floor at another hospital.  I recently/finally got a call from the nurse recruiter who scheduled a face to face interview.  When I asked why I had never heard anything previously she said they had not had any previous positions available which I found unbelievable.  Once I finally got contacted the process went pretty swiftly.", "Interview Questions": "I met with HR first then walked over to the hospital with the nurse recruiter.  She was pleasant enough.  Not sure why she waited so long on calling though??  Now that I am working in the department I realize I could have started a long time ago??  She one recruiter dropped me off to the hospital.  They brought me into a large conference room with 3 women staring me down and one gentleman at the head who ensured I felt comfortable.  Not sure if it was an aggressive woman thing or good cop and bad cops or what but the women were not very inviting.  One of them was a director of something, two were education nurses.  The dude was some sort of retention/happy RN sort of role.  He asked the hardest questions but somehow they were the easiest to answer.  The others made me feel like I was being judged or stupid.  The others asked about a time I had a difficult patient, a time I had a bad physician, a time I had a difficult cosworkers.  When I answered they just scribbled notes and if they did look up, just seemed like they were staring me down.  He was nice and helped me answer the questions by just asking more questions.  My mouth was so dry because I was so nervous and it was so hot out.  He got me some water which was so nice.  I had another upcoming interview at Tampa General.  was caught offguard by offer!!  I thought they might have dragged process on another year!!  If dude had not been there I would have not immediately accepted the offer they made me and gone to see about other job interview later in that week then decided.  Glad I got interview and accepted position.  Dude has been by to see me already and how I am fitting in and if I need anything.  He brings treats to all of the nurses here!!  Thinking about getting my masters which they wil l help pya for."}, {"date": "16 Mar 2015", "title": "RN Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 days.\u00a0I interviewed at AdventHealth Tampa in Jul 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "There were two interviews.
