You go into the interview and they ask you to fill out an application, but the application is like 30 pgs and includes new hire paperwork (which sends mix messages).  Interview questions are not focused on getting to know you as a counselor/therapist.\nInterview Experience for Kindred house - I arrive and my interviewer called out, so her supervisor conducts the interview.  Very pleasant, but has me filling out all this paperwork while conducting interview.  Interview was easy going and was told I would hear something by the end of the week and that \"You are a strong candidate.\"  That Friday I recieved a call from Supervisor to come in for a second interview with the original interviewer that called out.  Arrive and interviewer thought it was later in the day and asked if we can reschedule.  I was so annoyed. I told her not really, I drove an hour to get here.  Does the interview super quick and never hear from them again.\nInterview Experience for west chester house - interview was easy going but was expected to bring degrees and official transcripts without offer.  I personally feel I should have to pay for official transcripts without an offer.
