I was then scheduled for an interview with 3 department managers. The interview as about an hour and none of the questions were pretty standard. They could have been better prepared with questions and in reviewing my resume. I was contacted by HR quite quickly and asked about how flexible I would be on salary (the salaries at first are extremely low). Initially I had asked about the salary range but was told by HR that they did not know. This could have saved all of us some time because it was well below what one would expect considering the experience and qualifications they desire. I did let her know that while I was interested in the actual position, I was unable to consider the salary they were discussing.  I was then told by the HR person that there was another position that would soon be posted and it was more in the range I was looking for and encouraged me to apply for it. She requested that I submit another cover letter and resume for that position and would let me know when it posted. The position did post a month later and I applied. I was then informed that they pulled the position to change the requirements of the job and it would be reposted. I was then asked to submit ANOTHER cover letter, this time with salary requirements. I did so and never received the courtesy of any response back.  They are very disorganized overall- posting positions they never actually fill, interviewing and then months later reposting the same position.  Definitely not impressed with the process or professionalism.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me a time when you were working with a group of people and everyone wanted to do something differently than you did.

They then asked me to have a minimum of 5 references submitted to a website. Several of my references commented on how onerous this process was. Personally, I think it was somewhat premature since I had only one conversation with FIRST.\r\n\r\nFIRST then asked me to write a detailed letter on how I would contribute to the company and succeed in the Corporate and Foundation Relations Manager role. I sent that and a week and a half later was asked to have yet another phone conversation with someone else in the organization. There was no further communication until I received a terse email from HR stating that they were going to look for other candidates.\r\n\r\nThe process wasn't difficult (except for the HR manager's lack of personality) but it was frustrating due to the lack of communication. I expected more out of a foundation started by Dean Kamen.
