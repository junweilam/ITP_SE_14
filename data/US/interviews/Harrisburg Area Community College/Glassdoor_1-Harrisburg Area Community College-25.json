The first stage was with supervisors and the hiring manager, then progressed to a panel of individuals who were selected to represent different parts of the organization. \n\nThe organization is excessively reinforcing an artificial corporate culture of diversity. It's only good if it's authentic. \n\nDuring the first part of the interview we went over the usual interview questions for the position explaining why I would be a good fit etc. Toward the end after the manager explained what diversity meant to them \"no one should be judged based on how they look\". later asked, \"Why aren't you wearing a tie? \" To which I explained that this is a remote position, I was dressed appropriately in a nice solid color button-up shirt, and that the industry has moved to a more casual position on dress. To me this indicates that the employer cares less about the qualifications and more about control over the individual and how they look. \n\nDuring the first and second part of the interview as well as the application I was told to explain my view on diversity in the workplace 4 times. Diversity is important but it shouldn't be something someone needs to actively pursue, to be authentic about it, it should come naturally. This indicates to me that the culture of the workplace is struggling with diversity.\n\nThe interviewers also brought my age into consideration stating that I was pretty young and new to the field (5 years of industry experience) for this mid level position. Experience and qualifications should be the only thing discussed in an interview not age. Pay range was also below the industry normal. The interviewers had been with the company for decades, I don't believe they have had to hire a new addition to their team in a long time. \n\nOverall the staff on the board seemed friendly but there were too many red flags for me to consider this position if I were to get an offer. I have not heard from the organization, and the interview was a month ago.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you think diversity is important in the workplace? \n\nTroubleshooting questions"}, {"date": "3 Jun 2021", "title": "Records Specialist Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Harrisburg Area Community College (Harrisburg, PA) in Mar 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "A bunch of older ladies who know very little about the jobs they actually perform.

When they do call for the interview, the people are very friendly and helpful. The interview process is a total head-scratcher though. Basically it's anywhere from 3-7 people who each take turns asking scripted questions. No follow-up questions, they just move onto the next questions. The questions are strange as well. They seem to be very cerebral and would give the interviewers absolutely no idea of what the person being interviewed is actually like. It is odd to give answers and have no one comment on the answers or ask a follow-up question. I've had 3 interviews with them, and it's been the same way each time. I've also felt like it was a waste of time, because twice they decided to pull the position and not hire anyone due to lack of funding or something. Seems like a very, very nice place to work, though, provided you can get past the very strange interviews.", "Interview Questions": "What is important about global management of a learner centered environment?"}]]
