It was clear from the interview vibes that the org didn\u2019t care about the interview or already chose someone . The person  showed up late and was clear that she did not review my resume beforehand as she took moments to read over it while in the interview and made up questions on the spot.

I wanted to ask more questions but the HR person rushed me off quickly. Then I was asked to complete a project with a quick turnaround time. I completed it and then met with a senior leader. She was open and explained that the Chicago office was going through transition and she would serve as the interim Executive Director. The interview was fine. I moved to the next phase in the process which was a zoom interview with several people in various positions in the Chicago office, a senior leader from the national team, and a program manager from the LA office. The questions were typical interview questions but I few hands ones. I finished the interview and send individual thank you emails. They said I would hear something in a few weeks but I didn\u2019t hear anything. I checked in via email but no response. I\u2019m okay getting rejected for this role but it would have been nice to be notified of this especially since I went so far in the process in a short time frame.

During the phone interview, I was invited in for an in-person interview where I was interviewed by 3 people from 3 different departments.  The interview lasted about 45 minutes.  Every interviewer was under the age of 30. As a seasoned professional, I observed that diversity is not practice in the workplace.  They asked generic questions just to go through the motions when they had no motivation to hire me because I wasn't in their age range. This demonstrated that diversity is not practice in the organization and evaluation of resumes are extremely shallow for my experience spoke for itself. No disrespect to the younger generation but sometimes wisdom & experience is needed when making sound judgments. Needless to say, I didn't get the job due to age discrimination because there was no way in hell that my professional background didn't align with the job description.
