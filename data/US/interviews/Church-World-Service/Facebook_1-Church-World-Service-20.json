On the morning of the interview, I received an email from the hiring manager stating that she had an emergency and needed to reschedule. After not hearing back from her for over a week, I decided to reach out to her and was able to finally reschedule the interview. On the day of the interview, I was taken aback by her very dry and serious demeanor which gave the impression of someone either overly stressed or simply unhappy. In fact, during the start of the interview, she failed to provide a proper introduction about herself and went straight to asking questions. This abrupt start to the interview was very awkward and jarring. After I answered all her questions, I asked if she could tell a little bit about her role, and what her involvement was in the Refugee Welcome Collective project. By the end of the interview, I was told I should expect an invitation for a follow up interview. Unfortunately, that invitation never arrived even after I followed up twice. Based on the hiring manager\u2019s awkward interview approach and her lack of commitment to setting up a follow-up interview as I was told to expect, I am no longer interested in pursuing this role.", "Interview Questions": "What attracted you to this role?"}, {"date": "6 Apr 2023", "title": "Caseworker Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Church World Service (Nairobi)", "Interview Descriptions": "Behavioral questions on planning and organization, team work (dealing with people), working under pressure and how you fit to the job requirements in terms of your qualifications and experience.
