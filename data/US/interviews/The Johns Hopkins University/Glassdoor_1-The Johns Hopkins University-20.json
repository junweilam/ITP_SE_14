I was supposed to give a presentation but they weren't prepared at all. Four important people didn't show up for the interview. They are extremely disorganized. Everything seems hectic. The people who interviewed me warned from politics inside center and this turns out to be true. \r\n\r\nFew weeks later they offered me the job. The number was pretty insulting (less than 74 and more than 65) for someone who has a PhD with many years of experience. Their reasoning was first they don't have the money. Just imagine that JHU does not have enough resources for a reasonable salary. Second, they said the job description requires Master's and thus I should have only applied for PhD positions. They just wanted to take my PhD out of the equation although every one of their scientists team I spoke with stressed out the importance of my Education. When I mentioned that they said well we don't have the money. \r\n\r\nI simply rejected the offer. I don't want to work at place that depends on exploiting others. Things are clear for me. If I am over qualified for the position then you should say so from the beginning and reject my candidacy. But saying that I have the necessary qualification to succeed in this job but we will not consider your education means exploitation.    \r\n\r\nAlso, I felt I owe this to Statistics community in JHU. If I accept that poor offer, I would have made it harder to Master's holders to negotiate their salary. \r\n\r\nAnother tactic you should be aware of, they will always encourage you to accept the job that does have a weak salary and does not respect your education by saying that we will promote you someday to a very exciting position after you get some experience. Be aware of this trap and these empty promises. It is going to take them years before even considering any type of promotion. \r\n\r\nI know it is easy to go blind and get too excited when you see a potential to work for a big school.

After she obtained the references and eval, I was then contacted to interview with her boss who is the administrator.

HR called me 4 days later and scheduled me to come in and meet with them and occuaptional health. I still had not gotten my start date which I was very frustrated about. \r\n\r\nThat day, HR emailed me a million papers to fill out which included references checks from past employers, criminal background check, credit check and education verification consents.
