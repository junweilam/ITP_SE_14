Many \u201cclassified\u201d university positions should at least be at this starting level unless you have to track your actual hours worked. \r\n\r\nIf you indicate more for a starting salary, the departments will no longer consider you for the position. Do not try and get a higher salary initially even if you have more than enough of relevant experience and more that just the minimum required level of education. At SMU they try and get employees to start working there for the lowest salary possible and then give them about a 1.5%-3.0% raise annually for cost of living.
