Both in person.  Didn't get the job, which was fine, but they were 10 mins late to my first interview (coming in from outside, not that a prior interview ran over) and after second interview said I should hear in 2-5 weeks.  After 7 weeks (7!) I checked in and got a reply days later that they'd hired someone else.  Only 2 finalists, so not difficult to send an email saying \"we're still in the process.\" Which is what other places I interviewed with did. Had I not checked in, I'm not sure they  would have even remembered to let me know.  And I found out later, they hired a 3rd person who didn't meet the application deadline or follow the same process as the other applicants.  Night and day from where I work now. So, think carefully about the level of professionalism you're looking for.\r\n\r\nMore concerning than my hassle, they have a contract with the public hospital so their advocates are often the first ones there.  There is a very notorious case where a woman was assaulted by a police impersonator.  By the time the actual officers got there, the BB advocate had told the victim that all cops and DA's are bad, system is corrupt, and that she shouldn't cooperate. So even with the police begging her to tell them so they could try and help her and stop the guy, nothing.  I've since learned that this is not a one off, sadly. So again, think carefully about your own world view and the culture you want to operate in.", "Interview Questions": "What would you do if you learned of information that was harmful to the offender?"}, {"date": "13 May 2015", "title": "Canvasser Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at The Blue Bench (Denver, CO)", "Interview Descriptions": "The canvas director is super likable and she makes it easy to talk to.
