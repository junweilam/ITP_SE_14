I simply found a job I liked through Taleo and applied. I applied in November 2017 and interviewed exactly one month later. The interview questions were entirely behavioral. I have posted those below and they are verbatim. All my interviews were conducted via phone and Zoom (I lived a few time zones away) so I didn't interview on campus. After five or so separate interviews, I was offered the job and accepted (no negotiation because it wasn't \"allowed\"). This policy is common  for middle leadership roles.  Those five or so interviews took place over 8 days. It was a very quick and intense process but manageable. This was not the typical hiring experience...they were looking to hire quickly and have somebody hired in the role before the holidays.  I have posted interview questions for the first and second round interviews, with the same person interviewing. The third, fourth, and fifth interviews were with different people but their interview questions were basically the same questions but worded differently. If you aren't well-prepared, these questions will be difficult. I was very well-prepared but a couple of the questions threw me for a loop.  At those times, I just asked if we could go to the next question. By asking, I wanted to convey that I wasn't trying to avoid the question but instead wanted to get more time to provide a thoughtful answer. They were okay with that. I really hope this helps and I wish you well!!\r\n\r\nPS. Glassdoor is making me pick a city where I interviewed.

I possess all the required experience and I was interested in the research the director was doing. I was very excited about the opportunity and I figured this job was the perfect fit given I have previous Stanford experience. However unfortunately the interview team had no respect for me as a candidate. I was required to interview 5 times and they requested to speak on the phone to 9 references! Some of these references they talked to 2x. Having previously worked at Stanford I suggested that if they had concerns to check my employee record, which they did and they found nothing negative. They spoke to my current supervisor who made it clear she wanted to retain me and I was told that every reference I provided was overwhelming positive. I gave the interview team my current job description, current performance reviews and previous comments from over 20 people I managed in the past. After several weeks of back and forth they told me they had selected someone else and wished me the best.\r\n\r\nWhile I was frustrated waiting for the decision I was relieved when they turned me down because I was able to reassure my current boss that the process was over. However, almost 3 weeks later they came back asking me to re- interview! The whole situation was handled very poorly, all 9 references said they felt harassed during the questioning and they suggested that if I got the offer to be wary as the director was nothing short of rude. I have never in my career felt so disrespected. During the final interview, I was asked all the same questions as the first time around and I was so insulted at some of the comments (about my reputation) that I am relieved that I was not selected for the position. I found out later that regrettably (an internal non-reference) spoke negatively about me, which is why they had concerns. Overall a big waste of time, my references were treated badly, I found out someone I once looked up to as a mentor betrayed me internally, and the amount of disrespect to me during the final interview was unprofessional to say the least. Beware of applying here, there are administrative politics and if you don't play along you are automatically blackmailed.

Here's the saga that occurred: \r\n\r\nI applied online in July (heard of the position through word of mouth). First I was contacted by a recruiter a few weeks later and I had to answer a series of short essay questions and submit them via email. About a week after that, I was interviewed by the recruiter (pretty dry questions as a screening process). Close to a month passed and I figured they weren't interested in me but weren't going to tell me. Then the recruiter said they were delayed (this was all via email) but wanted to move forward with me over video. I was surprised because the recruiter was not that friendly, so I assumed I wasn't moving forward. The video interview was about an hour long with 2 people on staff. It went fine and they were friendly. Then, the process just got more frustrating. They had said about a week later they wanted to move forward with me in a final interview in person. Instead of asking me when I was available they gave me 3 options of when to come in. Obviously, I was interviewing for other jobs besides Stanford, so I was busy during all of those times, particularly because they only gave me a few days notice. \r\n\r\nWEEKS went by before we were able to schedule a final interview in person. The frustrating part about this was they would give me 12 to 24 hours to respond and then not reply to me for at least a week or two and it felt like they had pretty much forgotten... Finally, I had an in person interview which was 4 HOURS long with the whole department. I emailed everyone a thank you and checked in with the main woman I'd been communicating with. She never responded. A week passed- I emailed again. Still, NO RESPONSE. Then a month passed and I emailed- NO RESPONSE. I said very politely that I assumed they had chosen someone else, thanked them for their time, etc. Then 2 months after that in person interview, I finally get a generic rejection from the recruiter I talked to in the very beginning. I was in the final 3 and I got this response months later.\r\n\r\nI will never apply to a job at Stanford again. They have a holier than though attitude, and it was very clear to me throughout the process that my time was not even remotely as important as theirs. There should be mutual respect when you are interviewing somewhere, and they just don't have that respect for others.
