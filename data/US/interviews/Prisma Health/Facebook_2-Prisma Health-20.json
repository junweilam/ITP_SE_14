Then I heard nothing until the recruiter called me a couple weeks later telling me that they choose to go with someone else. However they liked me enough to still want me for an as needed job, and that there would likely be a second full-time role forthcoming. Over a month passed and I saw the second job and applied. Without any reason my application was immediately turned over. I tried to inquire and got cryptic messages that they choose to pursue other candidates and that if I still wanted the prn role to let them know. I reached out the lead to try to understand why they 1, seemed so interested intially, 2, turned away now twice despite the interest and qualification, and 3, being interested enough to have me in an as needed capacity but not full-time? My questions have gone unanswered. What they don't realized is that I wasted alot of time as they dangled the carrot in front of me, and they kinda led me along. For that I am disappointed and do not trust the way they do recruitment. Plus, just be honest and forthcoming.
