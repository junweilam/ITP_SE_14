Everything was friendly, and what I really liked about the job was the opportunity to help people. Other aspects like their technology were not the strongest point, tbh. I knew it, but I decided to listen to them and discover more about the organization. Until this moment they answered quickly the questions and all I needed (via email). In the last interview, I did my presentation, it was about something innovative and I answered all the questions. They decided not to continue with the candidature which is ok, maybe they wanted another thing. This is not the first time and won't be the last this happens, however, the problem is that they disappeared. Is ok if they wanted something else or simply if they don't like the candidate, but is not to ghost the candidates and send an automatic response after all the communication and interviews. Is disrespectful to the work done and childish as an organization. They demonstrated to be very immature and not taking care of the people they have around, which in the end, was my main interest, so I suppose this happened for the best.

I decided to talk with the hiring manager, she proceeded to tell me that it was backed up but they were still moving forward with my hiring process and would have more information for me in the coming weeks. I asked if I would be communicated to about delays, and timeline, she said of course.... Fast forward a month later, I had to email her to get an update.

I am a volunteer Crisis Counselor for CTL and before this hiring process I really thought this company was amazing. I have noticed so much wrong with the way they run after this.

By the third interview they had told me I would be about to start the first week of October, if selected for the position in order for me to be able to give the 4 weeks of notice. It was a pretty fast process as I was able to get my interviews back to back and they even squeezed in my third and final interview for the same week because they knew that if I interviewed the following week, I wouldn't be able to give the 4 weeks notice and start by the date in October that they had. I was given an offer on Tuesday of the following week!
