I met with two managers at the company, and answered all of their questions correctly. The second one was supposed to ask me technical questions but said he had lost one of the questions, and the only one he did ask had some errors in it so it was hard to answer it correctly. A day after the second interview I got a form letter saying that they were not going forward with the interview. I thought it was extremely disrespectful after the time I put into the interview to not at least send a personalized note or give me a call. The only guess I have on why they didn't want to hire me is because I have no experience with Kubernetes, but that's clearly stated on my resume and I'm a quick learner. The second guy I interviewed with gave me some advice on what I should read up on with Kube, but I felt like I had completely wasted my time researching it when I later got the rejection letter. Seriously, why hand out advice if you're not going to go forward onto the third round? Not every position uses Kubernetes or needs it, and my time to spend on interviews is fairly limited. They just came off as really full of themselves. I guess the dead give away should have been when the second manager told me that most companies only use 10% of what Kube is capable of, but then didn't explain any further what the missing 90% could be.", "Interview Questions": "How can you sort, list, and count entries from a log file with a script without using any bash?

It was very obvious there was a language barrier throughout as she would repeat back my answers and they were no where close to what I said. The interviewer also obviously did not review my resume, as they often misrepresented my work experience. One example is her thinking I had only worked for 1 company for 2 years and didn\u2019t have enough experience, when I actually have listed over 6 years of experience across multiple positions/companies.

I went to a couple of recruiting events to meet employees, expressed my interest to potential hiring managers, engaged with a recruiter.

After the final interview, I received no response at all. Not even a canned rejection email.\r\n\r\nInterview questions were sometimes odd. For example, I was asked a question that should be answered with an explanation of an OSI network layer model. How is it relevant to a supposedly software development PM role? Not that I don't know the answer, I just don't see a connection to the work that was described to me.\r\n\r\nInterviewers were friendly. I did not have much time to ask questions of my own. Recruiter instructed me before the interview to answer exactly the questions asked, so I stayed on that course, perhaps foolishly. The questions were often framed in such a way that answering in such a way did not showcase my relevant skills. For example, a question how I user certain things 'at my last workplace'. 'Last workplace' lasted less than a year, which is not too relevant compared to a 20-year professional experience. \r\n\r\nInterview took from 10am to 4pm, and included a lunch with two program managers. I had to reveal my dietary preferences to the recruiter, which in hindsight I wish I did not do: these preferences may be interpreted as a symptom of diabetes, and could have led to a negative decision.

When I got to the interview early and checked in, the lady at the front desk said they had just been asking about me and then the clinic manager and supervisor came and got me right away. I was given a detailed run down of the job description and duties and the kind of team member they were looking for. There were 4 people interviewing me. They took turn asking questions. Their main focus was on compassion since the specialty clinics serve cancer patients.

They thought it was at 2pm, but the recruiter scheduled and sent confirmation for 2:30pm (I arrived at 2:10pm).

I was under the impression, as stated in the interview, I would be contacted for a ride a long the following Tuesday. Left feeling great about getting this far. I left, did some errands and headed home. I checked my email after I arrived home and saw that the recruitment team had sent me a \"Thank you for applying\" but was not chosen.  The time on this email was within 15 mins of me leaving the interview. I thought maybe there was a misunderstanding, so I called and left a message with the recruiter, that I was to have a ride a long, and did not know if it was a mistake. I did not hear back, so I emailed recruiter as well, then left another message. I understand and respect that they changed their minds about me within 10 mins of walking out the door, but I wanted to make sure that there was not a mistake and I was truly suppose to be scheduled for a ride a long with another RN. I was perplexed. The two messages I left and the email was rudely disregarded. I shared this with my cohorts and they were appalled that a recruiter would not be kind enough to call me back, or email. I was an internal candidate. How do they treat external candidates.

Basic interview questions were asked with a live camera running.  I was timed and video taped on answering interview questions.  I believe my interview was viewed by HR out-of-state from where I was applying.  I was then told the company had changed the job description and I would have to reapply.  I reapplied.  Next I was called for an interview with the Manager of the department.  Some questions were asked about my experience but the Manager seemed disinterested.  The majority of questions that seemed important to the manager had to do with how I would handle conflict in the workplace. At the end of the interview, I was given a written test of my skills for the position. I was called back for a third interview with the VP, Manager (same one I had my previous interview with),and two employees I would be working with. Again, I was asked about conflict in the workplace. Also, one of the employees asked what I would do in a situation not related to the job or so I couldn't figure out how it could be.I answered it the best I could but felt that it really had nothing to do with this position. Based on the questions asked in the interviews, it appeared that there was some sort of internal conflict going on in the department. Also, the work environment was not very appeasing as  the three employees were in low wall cubicles where the top parts of their heads could be seen. They did not have much privacy. They had a radio playing in an empty cubicle. There was nothing on the walls. The Manager and VP's walls/offices were just as stark and unappealing as the other employees' work space.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of my third interview, the one with the Vice President and Manager, I was asked if I had any questions for them.  I asked them how they felt, with my qualifications and my interviews, and if I would be a good fit for the job. I left the interview feeling that I had answered the questions to the best of my abilities but didn't feel that they had. During the interview, they told me that they had posted another job with the same requirements. After the interview, I noticed the additional job posting online. I received a blanket response about a week later from HR that they had made another mistake in the job description and that the job posting had been \"closed or canceled due to the business needs of the department or because it is necessary to begin recruiting for the role with new position requirements\".  Now, both jobs were listed on the job board.  I debated about reapplying for the job, but did not, thankfully.  A few weeks later, I received a letter that another candidate with better qualifications was chosen.  At the time, one of the positions was still available and it was still available months later.\r\n\r\nThe whole interview process and follow-ups were handled very unprofessionally for what I considered a reputable company.

I can no longer work in Cath Lab because of physical issues so was looking for something less physically strenuous.

I was notified for this position by a recruiter so I did the initial phone interview.

My interview was scheduled for 8:00 am, but when I arrived at the appropriate building, the door was locked.  A reluctant employee finally let me in with his badge, telling me he was not supposed to do that.  Then there was no one at the reception desk.  Finally a security guard arrived and demanded to know why I was there, and then took about another 15 minutes to find the person I was interviewing with - so I appeared to be 20 minutes late, even though I had arrived on time.  The interview was a panel, with a list of prescribed questions, which were all behavioral, and none about my experience or background.  Because the interview started late (not due to my fault), there was little opportunity for me to ask questions or engage in any kind of conversation or dialogue. I finally heard from the recruiter about 3 weeks later, with the only message that I had been deemed \"not qualified.\" While I was initially excited about the prospect of working for a mission-driven, values oriented organization, this experience was so disappointing and disengaging that it painted a very different picture of this organization.", "Interview Questions": "Describe a time when a customer was not happy with a decision you made, and what you did it about it."}, {"date": "10 Nov 2015", "title": "Director of Sales - Digital Innovations Group Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Providence (Seattle, WA) in Oct 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "Uncoordinated.

The phone interview was informal and consisted of 4 people who asked a battery of questions about work experience, career goals, and a general explanation of the position. After the phone interview, waited about two weeks before being invited for a 10+ person panel interview. The day before the interview, I was introduced to the IT team and sat in a steering like committee. Everyone was very pleasant and nice.  The panel interview was very formal and everyone had a packet of behavioral and situational questions. This was very difficult but I was given as much time to think and answer the questions. At the end of the formal questions, it was an open session for everyone to ask their own questions. Overall, the interview went well but I do have to emphasize it was a little nerving. The work environments (hospitals) seemed pleasant but office space was lacking. Job position that was offered had lots of opportunity to learn various programming languages, improve on current systems, build database, build new relationships with clinical departments, and so forth.

She gave a rah-rah presentation that lasted more than an hour about what a great place Providence is to work. Complete with listing every single hospital unit, because apparently med/surg and cardiac floors are so different and groundbreaking in a hospital. She also waxed on about how Providence supports nurses continuing with their education--whether it be to get a masters or bachelor's degree. This became extremely ironic considering the following...\r\nAll 20 of the applicants got in line for a very public 1:1 \"speed dating\" interview with the head of the residency program in front of everyone else. It became crystal clear that this tired, 50-something woman preferred nurses who were young and had their associate's degree because ANYONE over 30 or with a bachelor's was summarily dismissed with no eye contact and a wave of the hand.
