Prior to the interview I told their HR person Mrs Alisha that I had to pick my children up before 6 pm. I was told that the position was from 2-6 pm and if I were chosen that someone from HR would contact me to notify and let me know if they could arrange me leaving by 530 pm. Three days later I was contacted by HR Mrs Hall and told the position was from 2-6 pm and if I could make future arrangements with my kids schedule to please call them back. (Im assuming) I was hired. Three days after that I was told thru my job recruiter that she received a email from the boys and girls HR stating I turned the job down and that they were willing to work with me within my time restraints. The email further stated that they were even willing to allow me to work at the Irmo sc location, which is 30 mins closer to my house. I was originally told the position was only being held for Cayce west Columbia location.  This is quite the opposite of what was explained to me from their HR Mrs Hall. I didn't like looking like a liar or that I declined a job that I went out of my way to interview for I would not want to waste anyone's time. I told my job recruiter I was going to see if the position was still available and see where the descepency was. Upon speaking to HR #1 Mrs Alisha out of only 2 HR staff I was told she did not send any email and that they had filled the position  but were willing to allow me to leave by 530 pm and I should call back in 2 weeks to address my concerns with the HR #2 Mrs Hall and see if any opening. I tried numerous times calling leaving vm with no response. Finally I called HR supervisor Mrs Harper to figure out the descrepencies. After explaining everything she reappointed me to #2 HR Mrs Hall and said she would have her call me directly. 2 hours later #2 HR Mrs Hall called. I explained the inconsistencies with # 1 was I actually hired? #2 will they in fact allow me to work within time restraints? and at the Irmo location? She stated she did not send a email to my recruiter however she in fact was who I originally spoke to. I asked her if she could follow up with my recruiter to notify her that neither she nor HR # 1 Mrs Alisha sent out a email as that would eliminate anything in question.  She replied by nastily stating she didn't care to take the time to clarify anything, that my recruiters email is here say and that my interview had great reviews and the position was still available. She went further to say all locations including Irmo had positions available, as she stated that, a person in the background corrected her telling her  the Cayce area is all they had then and now. So upon learning there were still positions available at any of their locations I reinterated, could they infact do as HR #1 Mrs Alisha said they were willing to, and allow me to work until 530 pm? HR #2 Mrs Hall replied by saying  the position was from 2-6 pm and no one would've told me anything different. I ignitially thought maybe my recruiter misconstrued the email but clearly with their who, what, where , when conflicts and not cross referencing the boys and girls club have a SERIOUS break down in their communication both with future applicants and each other.
