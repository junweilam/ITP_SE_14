The application form was long with a few essay questions and a cover letter. The application was lengthy but pleasurable to complete as there were in depth questions that spoke to the values of the company. I received an email prompting me to the next round within 2 weeks and then met with the hiring manager. This was a brief and casual meeting. I instantly felt attracted to the organisations values. I then received an exercise which took about 1hour 30 mins to complete. About a week after submitting the exercise I received an interview with the executive team which included a senior manager. The interview was somewhat a challenge as I received interview questions that I did not receive before. I felt like the questions were not basic questions and the interviewers seemed well prepared - the interviewers were professional, to the point and they were incredibly relatable. I had a really good experience and would gladly apply again. I did not get the position - but I was in the top 5 selected so I will improve for the next time.", "Interview Questions": "1.How would you deal with conflict between two candidate members? 2.

I did an initial screen with the recruiter and then did a second screen with a member of the team I'd potentially be working for. The third step was an exercise that was missing a lot of information and had low-resolution images with analytics that hindered proper project completion in my opinion. I did not advance past the assignment and received a rejection email at 5pm on a Friday through a generic email with no feedback. \r\n\r\nEveryone I interacted with was very kind and kept excellent communication and provided updates throughout the process.

They are very thorough in their process, much more so than any other job I've ever interviewed for. The people were friendly and ultimately I think they were looking for someone who is more experienced with data analysis, which wasn't clear from the initial job description, but became clear during the process. They seem like a really well organized organization and overall I was really impressed by them. I don't think the job was the right fit for me but I would apply again if there was a role that was a better fit in the future.
