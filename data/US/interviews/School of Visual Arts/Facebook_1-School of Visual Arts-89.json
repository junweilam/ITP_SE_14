The first interview was with the team leader.  The second interview was with the department team.\r\n\r\nI had expressed working with the department for which I interviewed over the course of approximately 1-1/2 years.\r\n\r\nI spent a total of approximately 1-1/2 hours interviewing and perceived that my joining the team would be mutually beneficial, that there seemed to be a culture fit in terms of personality and existing skills sets\u2014and that I could add value.\r\n\r\nAbout one month passed between the second interview and the beginning of the March COVID pandemic declaration.\r\n\r\nAfter several attempts to follow-up on my application, I did eventually hear back approximately six months later from the team leader.  They apologized for the drop in communication and explained the extenuating personal and business reasons behind it, which I appreciated.  \r\n\r\nThey inferred that the position for which I interviewed was no longer available.\r\n\r\nI would not be surprised if an internal candidate was selected for this position (this happens in higher-ed institutions frequently).  It is also possible that the budget originally allocated to the job for which I was interviewing got re-allocated to create a new role, to mitigate potential pressure from students whom might be concerned with the current \"political\" and / or \"social justice\" climate in our country.   Private corporations and educational institutions \"fear\" getting \"cancelled\" by their customers and matriculating students and so, hiring teams feel obligated to make certain decisions and adapt in extenuating circumstances, where personal or global health emergencies\u2014and \"political pressures\"\u2014may be variables.  Of course, it's also possible that they felt I simply wasn't the correct person for the job.\r\n\r\n\u2714\ufe0e That said, the expectation that a representative from the school's human resources department should have been enlisted to update me in a timely fashion regarding the status of my application is reasonable.\r\n\r\n\u2714\ufe0e I take no issue with not being offered this job or with the team that interviewed me.\r\n\r\n\u2714\ufe0e However, I would like to see seamless communication plans in-place for the future because my time has value and also, because I am familiar with the culture of this school and know they are capable of doing better.\r\n\r\n__\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n\r\nPlease note that this review is based on my own personal experience and perception and is protected by free speech laws within the jurisdiction of The United States Of America.

The interview lasted about an hour and twenty minutes. The first half of the interview was an orientation session although there was no offer or acceptance of the position beforehand. After complaining about having to prepare for a major holiday celebration that evening, Dr. Maryhelen Hendricks  alternately read from a three- or four-page, single-spaced course description, paraphrased the job requirements, and spoke in commands. Many of her sentences began with \"You will...\" . This had a smothering effect. She answered some of my questions during this monologue; most of the others, for the reasons stated below, became moot. The second half of the interview was a more typical question-and-answer session. It went well for awhile. Then she became increasingly confrontational. It began with her raising a routine manner: a background check. She said, \"If you've ever been in jail, you'd better tell me right now so we can say goodbye.\" I non-verbally indicated I had no criminal record. When I said there were several factors for me to consider regarding the position, including that I would have to reduce my hours at my current position to teach a class at SVA, she shot back, \"You could have had all three!\" When I replied that this had not been clear to me, she became visibly angry. When I requested a day or two to consider her offer, which was never explicitly made, Dr. Hendricks suggested that I should have interviewed earlier because she was leaving town next week. She then demanded that I \"decide here and now.\" I declined to do so, and the interview ended. It was clear from one of her emails that she was under pressure to fill the position, but there was no indication that this was a take-it-or-leave-it-on-the-spot proposition. I suspect that she wanted me very badly and therefore engaged in arm twisting to get me on board. Hectoring is a non-starter for me. If it appears in an interview, more of the same and worse is likely to occur on the job. That said, if you're willing to put up with that sort of behavior, SVA might be a good fit for you. If you're not, it isn't. The hourly rate is high---$89---but like most college adjunct positions, it is a lot of work, as the materials presented to me indicated. Dr. Hendricks said that a writing coach and other support staff are available to assist teachers with curriculum development and that people rarely leave.
