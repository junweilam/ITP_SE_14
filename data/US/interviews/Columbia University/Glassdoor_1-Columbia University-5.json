These include:  Circulation, ILL, Collection Development, Cataloging, Archival processing of special collections (like an ad for Prego Spaghetti Sauce \"You Name it!  It's in there!).\r\n\r\nFortunately for them, I am somewhat of the unicorn they are seeking as I have actually DONE 99.9% of those things in one way shape or form.  But did they care?  Not so much.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned each item in the ad (and the fact that I have done this before) I was met with a form of puzzlement as if ILL, Approval Plans etc. had absolutely nothing to do with the job after all.  I can't say for sure, because the guy interviewing me (who was about 25 years old) said \"Well, I'm not a librarian so I don't know.\"  I responded with, \"all of this stuff is on my resume so I guess there must be SOME reason you called me.\"  He admitted that yes, \"your background does closely match the job description.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, I knew I was doomed when the interviewer followed up with \"I'm just calling you to see if you fit our culture.  We have a really great culture, it's sort of like a Silicon Valley startup here. They also have a lot of weekly meetings where they listen to a presentation and pat each other on the back and say cool things.  Oh, and they also suggested that \"we don't work 9-5 here\" the implication being that they work \"tech hours\" which is like 75 hours a week or something like that.  The word \"teamwork\" was thrown around as if working in teams is actually a good thing.  The only real question I was asked to answer was 'when was the last time you were creative?'\"\r\n\r\nWhat I actually wanted to say was this:  \"You get a list of books, you order them.  Then you mark them as received and you pay for them.  you do not have to be a Leonardo Da Vinci for this.  But just so you know, I did win a blue ribbon at a Junior High School art exhibit.\"\r\n\r\nMy take on all this was they googled me after they set up the phone interview.  They then realized to their horror I was not 20 years old and they had to back-pedal somewhat by insisting that I wouldn't want the job because they work 70 hours a week and are mostly young \"creatives.\"  But why are they asking for an acquisitions librarian if that is not actually the job they are looking to fil.", "Interview Questions": "What is an area where you could use improvement?"}, {"date": "31 Aug 2015", "title": "Research Technician B Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Columbia University", "Interview Descriptions": "Applied online through the career site.

I just finished graduate school, so am just staying up applying to jobs. Am currently unemployed, as I left my previous job to attend school full time.  Got a call for an interview at 4pm that day (I was very qualified for this position.) Interview was for 2pm the next day (Friday).  \r\n\r\nI interviewed with three people (3 interviews back to back), with a department administrator, another coordinator I would be working with, and the director of the program. Each about 30-40 minutes. Generic interviews, each basically repeating what the last person said/asked. Generic questions (tell me about yourself, Strengths/weaknesses, how would you co-workers describe you, etc...) Pleasant people. We were getting along. I asked a lot of relevant questions, as I had had a similar role at NYU Medical Center.  Typical, windowless, cold, hospital setting.  Went well. \r\n\r\nThen it started getting weird.  Got a call from the administrator on Monday morning that they wanted to call my references.  She left a message, since I wasn't by my phone. Her tone of voice on the message seemed like she didn't really want to leave the message, or was annoyed that she had to leave a message.I called back pretty quickly. She wanted a list of names and numbers over the phone.  Already felt weird because I it would have been better to e-mail a list for accuracy. I would expect this more from an older faculty member, not a younger administrative person.  I started listing off names, and spelling them, but them stopped, laughed and said that it might be easier if I sent all of this in an e-mail, so she has an accurate list of names, numbers, and correctly spelled e-mails. She was hesitant to even give me her e-mail, but she pleasantly agreed with me that it would in fact be easier to send it in a text form, and gave me her e-mail. I still dont' understand why she didn't e-mail me in the first place for something like this. Scheduling an interview via phone, ok. But asking for a list of references? I would think and administrator would know a little better. What was also strange was that she only wanted references from my last position, not from any other positions I held, which really limited the amount of references I could give her.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week, I was contacted by one of my references and she said that they gave me wonderful references! (This is the administrator at NYU, btw, and she contacted me via e-mail.) They hoped I would get the job, and I ended up having lunch with them a few days later to catch up.  She even said that if they had a job opening at NYU, they would consider me, but they don't at the moment.  To me that especially shows that they gave good references to Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe following week, I hear nothing from Columbia. I send a follow up e-mail to the one I sent with the references. A few days go by. Nothing, Ignored. Another follow-up e-mail. Nothing.  I check the Columbia job portal, the position had been filled. But not by me. \r\n\r\nYou would think they would at least send me a rejection letter, but, nope.  A rejection letter is professional after an interview, and especially if you call references. Maybe if I called for a follow-up, the administrator at Columbia would have responded.....

I also thought it was rather ironic that the guy calling me out on my \"time management skills\" was at least 10 minutes late for the interview and also didn't even stick to the timeline he gave me concerning when I would hear back about the position. By that point, I realized this whole interview was a joke and that they never had any intention of considering me as a serious candidate. I could go on and on but I will stop there....
