I believe that interviews are a reflection of company culture, and if my experience is at all typical - RUN. Do not apply for a job here. \n\n1) I applied for a different position and was shortly notified that while that position was not a fit, they had another job for which they were \"very excited\" about me as a candidate. They asked me to apply, so I did. \n2) The first interview was a one way video recording - awkward but manageable. And online platform present questions, you answer them on video and the recording is sent to the hiring manager. \n3) Within days, I am invited for a 2nd interview. I was contacted on a Friday morning,  the interview was planned for Monday afternoon. \n4)For this, they asked me to prepare a 15 minute presentation on a marketing plan for their business. It is not easy to write a marketing plan for a business based only on outside knowledge. I spent at least 10 hours researching, writing, and preparing a presentation (the entire weekend - since I only had 2 days notice on the interview).\n5) The interview is a video call, and of the 5 people on the panel only two of them had the decency to turn on their cameras. The hiring manager did not even have his camera on. Insulting and unprofessional. \n6) I receive a follow up a few days later requesting \"letters of recommendation\". This was an odd request that I have not received from any other company. I told the HR person I would need to request those from my contacts, and then sent 4 letters within a few days.\n7) I received NO acknowledgment that my letters had been received until I followed up a week later. At that time I was told that I would hear from them withing the next week. \n8) Nothing. No calls, no contact. Its been over 2 months, and they simply ghosted me. \n\nUtter B.S. if you ask me. I understand if I am not the right fit for the job, not hurt feelings here. But TELL me that. When you ask a candidate to put in as much work as I did for an interview process, you owe them the basic human courtesy of a follow up. \n\nI strongly advise future applicants to avoid this company. The way they treat candidates is unacceptable and not a good indication that they would treat employees any better.", "Interview Questions": "Prepare a presentation for the interview panel.

After reading all the reviews on here and looking at some of the previous employees, I am thankful I have dodged a bullet. First off, the interview process is very out dated with a 5 steps to get hired. First you have a HR interview, then a phone call with a  manager to try and enroll a student930-45 mins long), then a video interview with 2-3 managers or directors( hour long), then an assessment, then a campus president interview.  At first I was just going to let all of this slide and be a good person and try and get through this process. Let me remind you, the position I was interviewing for was a remote position, yet the questions I was being asked had nothing to do with working from home or being able to help a student through the process of getting there education. CSU has a a grading scale they use on the interviews where you have to get 85% or you do not move forward. I was told this has never failed them , but It seems with all the turn over and people not happy with the company, the culture is the biggest issue. A score should not define ones ability to work for a company, but maybe have some ability to spot some talent and not be lazy and revert to some score or game. My 10+ years of education I was willing to take to CSU, but they sent some typo driven email to me saying they have went with other candidates for the jobs.  maybe have a little more ability to spot talent and pick it rather then use some system that is filled with many holes and disadvantages for the University.
