It's a great forum to ask questions and potentially sticking out.  From there they invite you to meet one on one if you're still interested.  After the one on one interview they will call you back to set up another round of one on one's.  I interviewed with the Senior Director of Admissions and HR Rep as well as the campus President and CFO.  All were very professional and well spoken... the CFO had no clue what he was doing and really didn't know much about my position, but other than that, it's important to impress everyone.  In my opinion the trait they're looking for is that you are comfortable talking with people and are able to gather information from the conversation.  Being able to ask open ended questions is a great strategy.  I recommended a friend and told him to mention \"open ended questions\" in his interview and he got the job.", "Interview Questions": "(in regards to potential student) How would you get someone to talk to you if they were very shy?"}, {"date": "23 Mar 2010", "title": "High School Representative Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 1+ week.\u00a0I interviewed at The Art Institutes (Chicago, IL) in Mar 2010", "Interview Descriptions": "An employee forwarded my resume and cover letter to the hiring manager. I was then contacted via email and asked to complete a questionnaire. The manager liked my answers and I received and email a couple of days later inviting me to a group information session where I learned more about the role as well as the compensation (benefits and salary parameters) that the position offered. It was conducted by two individuals, who stated the hiring decision was a group one. I was also asked in the email to prepare a 2-3 minute presentation on the benefits of a product or service, as this is an educational sales job. A couple of days after delivering my speech, I received a call to set up a phone interview. I was provided with a phone number and access code to dial in. There were three people on the line, the two who had conducted the group session and one additional person who did not say anything. The interview was a little tricky, but the interviewers were friendly. I was told I would be contacted by either way. Two weeks later, I was notified that they went with someone else for the position. The company culture seems great- they really want to see their employees grow within the company, the benefits package outstanding, and the hiring manager was extremely down-to-earth. The presentation rattled my nerves a bit, so I suggest preparing well in advice. Further, when asked to \"tell me about yourself\" I advise prospective candidates to really focus on their sales experience, whatever that might me. A little bummed I was not offered the position, but the interview series was great experience of what to, and not to, do on a sales interview.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me more about yourself, beyond what we see here on your resume."}, {"date": "13 Oct 2014", "title": "Admissions Coordinator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at The Art Institutes (San Diego, CA) in Mar 2010", "Interview Descriptions": "Consisted of two panel interviews, pretty grueling.
