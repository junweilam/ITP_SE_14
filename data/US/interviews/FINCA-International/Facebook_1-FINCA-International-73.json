She asked very interesting, intelligent, and relevant questions (not the silly old-school hiring questions) that really got to the heart of what it would take to do the job and also to fit into the FINCA culture. We spoke at least two languages during the interview! (That was not a requirement, but it was a flavor of the wonderful, global nature of the organization.) Speaking with the global recruiting director impressed me greatly and spoke volumes about the high quality of staff and the culture at FINCA. Off to a good start!\r\n\r\nShortly after that phone conversation (I think a matter of days), I was contacted by the department hiring manager. We talked at length (about one hour). Within a couple of days I was asked to provide work samples and then to respond to five questions that required a fair amount of research and writing. \r\n\r\nAfter my work/presentation was reviewed, I was advanced in the process and invited to participate in person for a panel interview with three of the organization's senior executives.
