Time consuming process due to the number of on-site interviews required. Everyone on the teams I spoked to seemed knowledgeable and like good people to work with. Most had been there for years. The actual interviews went well which made overlooking the logistical issues of the process possible.\n\nThe problem is their internal communication amongst each other (HR, teams, Directors) is poor. For example one is completely unaware that you've already been on-site to interview multiple times.\n\nI had interviews rescheduled on me for which i took vacation from my job for and I wasn't notified until shortly before the scheduled interview. They are not intentionally inconsiderate but just too preoccupied to be aware of the fact that you have a job and need to allocate money and time to meet with them.\n\nAdditionally they were not on the same page in terms of the salary they were willing to offer for this position. Which led to confusion come offer time as the range discussed on two separate occasions two months prior was never even feasible despite it being conveyed that the manager was aware and ok with the range.  And we are talking a 30% differences from the bottom end of that range to the offer. This resulted in me being led to believe there was a lot more money to be offered then was and as a result, led to both sides basically wasting each others time interviewing in the first place.\n\nLastly, after complimenting all of those I met with and the organization I was treated rudely by the HR recruiter (i literally just complimented that person as well) who became upset when I rejected the offer and proceeded to explain all the reasons why they were unable to offer more which was basically a list of reasons not to work there. I was not upset that they could not offer more. The market for the position is what it is. what bothered me was that this could have all been avoided. I tried to convey that in hopes it would provide a change in their process so someone else could avoid this problem but it was not heard as like I said the HR recruiter was too upset to listen. I ended the call professionally once this happened and that was that. A lot of time wasted, and if they had their internal communication better organized we could have stopped the process after the first call.\n\nAgain I will reiterate that the people on the teams seemed like good people to work with. I would recommend anyone interviewing verify the potential salary early on and confirm that the person you are talking to is in fact knowledgeable of the salary range and has authority to communicate that range.

Division manager brought me to the cafe, where we sat waiting for woman who would be my immediate supervisor, she arrived late and was very cold the whole time, made minimal eye contact and seemed pretty angry the whole time. Division manner was very nice, made small talk and described very in depth my position. Took me on a tour of the space where I would potentially be located (space was not allocated at time of interview). Immediate supervisor did not say a word through the tour, then left in the middle of interview. After I was taken to the exit, division manager said he would be in touch, heard nothing for about 2-3 weeks, then an HR recruiter contacted me for an interview conducted by HR. He was more thorough, typical interview conducted by an HR professional, but slightly obnoxious. Asked what I wanted to make, said he didn't foresee it being an issue but ultimately would be up to the divisional manager, said he would be in touch, at this time he requested references.
