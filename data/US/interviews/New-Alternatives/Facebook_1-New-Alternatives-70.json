The interview consisted of me filling out a lengthy form (approx. 20 minutes), followed by a one-on-one meeting with the person who would have been overseeing me (approx. 40 minutes). I arrived about 10 minutes early for the interview, and was only told at that time that I needed to fill out the form, which consisted of questions about my previous work experience, credentials, etc... all of which could be found on the copies of my resume that I brought to the interview. The form seemed redundant, and it also delayed the actual one-on-one meeting, which left me feeling flustered/rushed to get through the form. New Alternatives should inform applicants ahead of time that they should arrive 30 minutes early in order to complete the form, or at least make it clear that the form is part of the interview process, so as to put applicants' minds at ease.
