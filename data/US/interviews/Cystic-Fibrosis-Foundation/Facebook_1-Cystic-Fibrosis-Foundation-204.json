I applied via their website and was called by a recruiter who went over the position a little more and asked me some basic questions. During this time, he stated that the chapter that this position was posted for had expressed extreme interest in me and wanted to move quickly to have me come in for an in-person interview. I set up an in-person interview with the executive director and felt that the interview went well. She stated that she would be in touch by the end of the week . I had not heard anything for over a week, so I reached out to the recruiter. He responded two weeks later, saying that they would be in touch. I did not hear anything again, so I sent two more follow-up emails stating that I was still very much interested in the position. I am not usually one to \"bug\" recruiters or hiring managers, but they let on that they thought I would be a good fit and wanted to move quickly, so I thought reaching out would be a good idea. They have since hired someone for the position. I never heard back from anyone at the organization, and I still haven't received the standard thank you for trying email. Don't express extreme interest in a candidate and then never respond to them.

When I arrived on site, I was pleased to see that the staff is immediately warm and welcoming, and offered me the utmost courtesy.  I interviewed with the department manager and we discussed the position in detail.  I spent roughly 1.5 hours there total, and was told a decision would be made within 2 weeks. I received an email the next day to complete a background check and the next day I received an offer via telephone!  I was sent new hire paperwork after submitting my signed offer letter, which contained a wealth of information regarding the orientation, the training schedule, benefits, and various tax forms to complete. I am extremely impressed by this organization since they sent all the information ahead of time and gave great detail in the company's mission to train and invest in their employees.", "Interview Questions": "What is your experience working with insurances?"}, {"date": "14 Feb 2014", "title": "Intern Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (Pittsburgh, PA) in May 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "I found the internship on Craigslist.

Received an e-mail from thier HR representative the next day to schedule a phone interview. The HR representative e-mailed me the night before requesting a reschedule. I accommadated the request. It was scheduled for the following week. The phone interview experience was fine. At the end of the phone interview the HR representative scheduled a 1:1 interview with the hiring manager for the position for the following week. The next day I received an e-mail (while I was traveling) requesting a phone interview with the hiring manager for the next day. I again accommadated the request. The next week I did in fact have the 1:1. The directions to the building were less than clear. Upon arrival the receptionist was preoccupied with the phones and some delivery people so it was a little crazed at the receptionist desk. Otherwise the interview was typical. A nonselection e-mail was sent nearly a month later and it appeared they didn't select anyone.", "Interview Questions": "How do you approach identifying/developing a training program from scratch?"}]]
