Since I was accustomed to administrative searches and had chaired/served on search committees myself, I knew that this behavior portended that the interview was merely a perfunctory exercise.  \r\n\r\nThe position which I sought was technically not vacant, as the post-holder, who was serving in this capacity on an interim basis, had been seconded from another campus department several months before with her previous post advertised soon thereafter.  While this person had simply been designated as Assistant Vice Provost on the division\u2019s website, I discovered between my Skype and in-person interviews through a non-university publication that she and another AVP were serving ad interim.  Nonetheless, I decided to visit Madison for continuous learning purposes.\r\n\r\nMy interview commenced around noon with only three committee members.  The questions that they posed were fair enough and my presentation, which was lightly attended, ensued thereafter.  In my humble opinion, the question to which I responded during my presentation basically asked me how I would represent the Vice Provost across campus.  I decided to be a bit more intentional by focusing on processes, stakeholders and possible innovations during my talk.  Not too long after I started my presentation, the newly-hired Chief of Staff  (COS) walked out; his face had evinced disgust throughout his stay.  I ignored this petulant behavior, completed my presentation and was taken to the Vice Provost's office for a meeting.\r\n\r\nAfter having sat in a chair outside his office for a while, the COS, without introducing himself or apologizing for leaving my presentation, abruptly moved me to an ante-room elsewhere; there was a confidential meeting being held in the adjoining conference room and a large sign to this effect was placed on the door.  My meeting with the Vice Provost was ok, despite subtle comments/hints that betrayed his lack of interest in my candidacy. My last meeting for the day, comprising two Assistant Vice Provosts (one of whom was permanent) and the Chief of Staff, was extremely hostile; the permanent AVP at one point told me not to expect that I would act there like I did at two other research institutions with which I had been affiliated.  For his part, the COS did not disappoint; after I had answered an open-ended question, he rolled his eyes, looked at the clock and told me that I should keep my responses short.  I smiled, apologized and noted that I would be succinct henceforth; the other interim AVP told me not to apologize and I said that it (apologizing) was a practice that was not alien to me (she later walked away without saying goodbye).  Later the COS, who had been tasked with taking me back to my hotel, told me with disdain that because it was raining, he would have someone else take me. \r\n\r\nThe lack of transparency and accompanying treatment that was meted out to me were appalling but deliberate.  There were trivial but revealing slights such as not being collected from or driven to the airport, selecting my only meal there (lunch) from Panera\u2019s website, paying for my room at a university-owned property and later having the gracious man at the desk fix the \u2018problem\u2019 and waiting approximately 3 months to obtain a refund for travel-related expenses with every excuse deployed for the tardiness.  I also was asked to complete a background check before my arrival because they wanted to 'proceed quickly'; this was another blatant red flag that I chose to ignore in the moment.  At a minimum, I ought to have commenced the background check, if at all, after the in-person interview.  They phoned my references the day after my interview (all of them contacted me promptly and specified who called and what was discussed) and the post was offered to the interim AVP.\r\n\r\nIn closing, I know that the intent of everyone (almost?) in the diversity division during my visit was to ensure that their \u2018friend\u2019 formally got \u2018her\u2019 job.  Notwithstanding, I was surprised that the visit of an outsider like myself could engender so much derision and condescension, while the division concomitantly claimed to be the conscience of the university on diversity-related matters.  The irony of this dissonance was not lost on me, while accepting the fact that people rationalize who is deserving of respect based on the exigencies of the moment and their parochial interests.  Given the division\u2019s (and perhaps the institution) nonchalance, penchant for nepotism and palpable toxicity, this place would not have been a good fit for me anyway.  One other proviso that is worth bearing in mind: your account and its contents would only be deleted six years after the post for which you applied had been filled.  I know because I got a specific answer from HR only after much probing.", "Interview Questions": "The Skype questions portended a great deal of angst in the division and addressed the manner in which the AVP would assuage the concerns of staff members.
