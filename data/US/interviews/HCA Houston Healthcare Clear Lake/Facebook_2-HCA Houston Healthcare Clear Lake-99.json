So the supervisor pushed it through anyways, then once I arrived; apparently you are treated like a child, someone has to practically hold your hand the whole way to your interview (hey we're adults, treat us like adults mmk?), but I never made it that far, I came dressed in a real expensive and nice dressy jean (silver brand) and a dockers brand long sleeved dress shirt with dockers dress shoes. Well later she came out (after I sat for almost 30 minutes, even though they say arrive 15 mins early (and i'm the unprofessional one?). Well to continue, she said I wasn't dressed appropriately and that they had to cancel the interview due to those circumstances. I would like to note that every job I have ever landed I dressed that way, actually the only job I didn't land was a big corporate sales job and I dressed in a very expensive suit which I returned the next day because I don't wear suits, they're very uncomfortable and I ain't bill gates lol.
