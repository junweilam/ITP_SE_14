I asked beforehand who would be there and was told hiring manager and maybe a couple other people. This was a surprise.\r\n\r\nMost questions were asked by one or two people. The other panel members were quiet, in my opinion. Most were informative and responsive as I asked questions. A couple of people stood out in the process, as I felt they went way out of their way to engage and make me feel welcome.\r\n\r\nI was invited to a \"finalist\" interview and asked to interview panel members and complete a writing test, which would be followed by more take-home writing.\r\n\r\nI was given an AP-style editing test using traditional proofreader\u2019s marks, along with a PR writing piece, both to be completed within a half hour. Manager told me to do editing first.  \r\n\r\nI had conveyed that I hadn\u2019t done AP writing in a number of years. I haven\u2019t seen manual proofing since high school.\r\n\r\nFor the PR piece, I was given several sentences and no other instructions. There was no time to complete it after the editing. The take-home assignment was an article and social posts based on PR piece.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the manager demanded, via email, my personal notes/questions from my \"interview.\" I asked later, after the process, what the purpose of this was.  He never answered me. The lengthy interview process, in my opinion, was never completely transparent, and I received a negative response when I asked questions about it (from the hiring manager). The department assistant, on the other hand, was very polite and helpful.\r\n\r\nWhile this was  partially a web editing job, there were no tests given for coding. I was tested on my self-revealed weakness--AP-style editing.\r\n\r\nThe other \"finalist\" had a journalism degree and specialized in sports writing. He also did AP editing. \r\n\r\nI asked if there was an internal candidate. There was a long awkward silence before one panel member said, \u201cuh, no.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey hired an intern who worked at U of D at the time of the posting. He is a white male and less than half my age. Had I known there was such a candidate, I would have withdrawn from the process early on.\r\n\r\nAfter job rejection, I wrote thank you letters to seven of the panel members. Two members wrote back to wish me well.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\nMarketing department diversity: two women, one possibly Asian, seven apparently-white males. \r\n\r\nThe University sports marketing department appeared to be all males last I checked. \r\n\r\nI was a minority candidate.\r\n\r\nI lost out on a part-time opportunity while waiting out this nine week \"process.\" \r\n\r\nU of D Mercy posts the following on their website: \"University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy is an Equal Opportunity Employer and considers all candidates for employment equally regardless of age, color, national origin, race, sex, or handicap.
