The second I walked into this interview I knew I wasn't going to be selected. One of the members of the team just stared at me and didn't say a word nor did they get up from their chair. They didn't shake my hand and they stayed distant, which I respected because of potential COVID concerns. Their questions were repetitious and didn't really indicate that they were interested in getting to know the candidate. The interview was hard for me to stay engaged in as I saw one of the members of the panel whispering to the member to their side. That same person was writing things on their paper and showing their colleague in a \"discreet\" way but when I caught them, they gave me a caught-in-the-act side-eye look. \r\n\r\nOne of the panel members' personal phone also rang during this interview. They didn't take this seriously at all. I made the effort to come in through bad weather, too. They were all clearly burned out and they brought that energy in with them, not even hiding it. I will never apply for a position with this team again.
