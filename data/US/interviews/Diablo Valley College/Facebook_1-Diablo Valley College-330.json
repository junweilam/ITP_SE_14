It's a hiring panel of a handful of people who interview you. Most interviewers are hard to read in terms of how they feel about you, and in fact, appear neutral when you answer (some merciful panel members will nod once in awhile, but that's rare). Interviews are not conversational, but just a question and answer quickfire (you answer each question and then move on to the next); no room or time for chit-chat or more informal/friendly discussion. Teaching presentations are also part of the interview process, which takes a lot of preparation.
