The next month, a recruiter contacted me and asked me to quickly gather five references (\"within 24 hours\").   This wasn't simply listing the references -- they require that the five references complete an online assessment.  My references moved with urgency to get this done, and I had to complete a questionnaire detailing my qualifications.  (Really, isn't this what resumes and cover letters -- both of which I'd already submitted -- are for?)\r\n\r\nTwo months went by.  Then, someone in the department I'd be working in contacted me to fill out another questionnaire (\"so we learn more about you,\" she said).  It was very similar to the questionnaire I'd filled out two months earlier, with the recruiter.   This was an early red flag to me about the lack of communication there.\r\n\r\nOne week later, she set up an online video interview with me.  Three of us on that call, which lasted just under an hour.  Went well.  \r\n\r\nThis was followed by two more video interviews, one with other team members I\"d be working with, and then a third interview with two people in another department.  They rescheduled the third interview the day it was supposed to take place -- again, expecting me to be at their beck & call.  These were your typical stilted group interviews, and most people were friendly.   On this last interview, one of the employees asked me to send him examples of my work.  I did, but never got a response.\r\n\r\nNo response after that from anybody else either, even after I sent a follow-up message.   Two months went by and the position has been filled.  \r\n\r\nOf course I can accept that they hired somebody else.  What's hard to swallow is the unprofessionalism and zero respect for my time and energy they displayed.  They expect candidates to jump through hoops (which I really did), but then ghost you.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole process, there was an undercurrent of \"You're privileged to get to interview with us, and you'll be lucky if we allow you to work here.\"  Well, no.

I should mention that I received a request for references after confirming the in-person interview with a requirement that my references complete an assessment of me within within 24 hours. I though this was strange since I hadn't even interviewed yet, but I contacted the FIVE people they requested and asked for my references to complete the online assessment as soon as they could. I was scheduled to meet with two people. The manager who was over the position I applied for and then the department administrator. I arrived early, checked in with the receptionist and then sat and waited for 15 minutes after the interview start time as the manager searched for an empty room and waited to see if the administrator would be joining us.\r\n\r\nMy time with the manager was pleasant for the most part. They walked me through the duties and we had a good conversation about my experience and what their expectations were for the position. They seemed interested, but mentioned that I would need to speak with the administrator before continuing to the next step. I should mention that the administrator was not present at all during the first 45 minutes of the interview and the manager had to go see if they were available and planning to join the scheduled interview. Once the administrator joined in, everything went downhill. I have encountered mean-spirited rude people in the workplace before, but most are smart enough to hide it in the interview phase when trying to recruit new talent. \r\n\r\nThe administrator was icy and prickly as soon as they saw me (I definitely didn't fit in \"racially\"). They sat down and asked me to go over my experience. I started to speak when I was rudely interrupted by the administrator who huffed and told me to hurry up since it was the end of the day and they had other duties to attend to. This was baffling since I was given limited dates to choose from, with most of the dates being at the end of the week and after 1pm. I kept my composure and continued on when I was interrupted again by the administrator. This time they told me that to be transparent, they had already found the person they wanted  and were planning on going with them since they had 5+ years of experience and it would not be fair to take the opportunity away from them to give to me. I was dumbfounded. The position I had applied for was an ENTRY-LEVEL position that required at least 1 year of experience, which I had. There were other open PC  positions that required 3+ years of experience so it was extremely strange that they were knowingly placing a mid-level applicant in an entry-level position.\r\n\r\nAfter that comment, I shut down. The administrator continued to prod and ask me if I had any questions. I said no. They continued to ask and seemed a bit perturbed that I didn't want to continue with the farce of an interview. I should mention that during this time the manager was sitting meekly and quietly staring at the table. They did not interject at any point or try to speak up on my behalf.  This was all I needed to know about the department and I was not interested in dealing with a meek manager and a terror of an administrator.\r\n\r\nOne of the most demoralizing interviews I have had to date, but I am glad that the administrator showed their \"everyday\" nature in the interview because it made the decision of steering clear of UTSW very easy. If you can act like that during an interview, how are you during the day to day? The one positive was that they validated my parking so that I didn't have to spend $2 leaving this bullying session.
