They are terrible at communicating and left me hanging for days in between each step and feeling strung along through the whole process.  The first part of the process is applying and their only response to this was to send the initial tests via email.  No human reached out to me to tell me more about the position or make me feel good about wanting to work there.  Days went by without a word and I had apparently passed the test someone from HR arranged a phone screen with the hiring manager.  That felt very cold and like the person was just going through motions and checking boxes on a checklist.  At no time was I ever asked if I had any questions.  Days go by again without a word and apparently I passed this portion because I was invited on site to interview in person.  For the in person I met with the boss's boss first.  This person was very personable and was very thoughtful with their style and questions.  The next person was the hiring manager.  Completely opposite experience of the first person and very cold and box checking.  I then did a panel with a few peers of the position and the boss.  Again, very cold and box checking, except I don't think they had even discussed their approach or questions beforehand because many of the questions did not apply to the position or my background.  More days go by before hearing that the hiring manager wants ANOTHER phone interview.  This time it was 30-40 pre-written personality/situational questions that were ridiculous and again mostly not relevant to the position.  More days go by, we are up to about 6 weeks of this process at this point with little to no communication at any point.  Now the HR/recruiter calls me unscheduled and asks if I have a few minutes to chat.  I'm thinking she's calling to make an offer.  Nope.  She's calling to do ANOTHER phone interview with another set of 30-40 personality/situational questions.  This took more than an hour and was completely unexpected and I had no chance to prepare for it.  After this, again, no communication.  2 more weeks go by and finally I get the generic rejection email from their application system.  I had almost forgotten about the position by the time I got the rejection email because of how long this whole process took.  After all of that time I wasted interviewing with them, they can't even bother to thank me for my time or give any feedback whatsoever.  The good news is that I don't have to work there because this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth.   I won't even go to a doctor that's affiliated with Northside even though I live 5 minutes from the main campus.
