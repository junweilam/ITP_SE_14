If the institution has set protocols for hiring, they do not make sure the research PIs follow them. \r\n\r\nIn one case, the hiring manager seemed to like me but wanted me to complete lengthy on-campus training courses and work a \"trial period\" in her lab lasting several weeks without pay before she would extend me an official job offer.  I did not feel comfortable going along with that plan, so I withdrew my application.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, I received a job offer from another lab detailing the pay, hours, and expected start date.  But the PI did not send me information on the health insurance and benefits at USC, so I asked him to send them to me before I made my decision.  He did not respond and I had to ask again two days later, at which point he sent me the benefits information but seemed very irritated in doing so.  That same day, after I looked over the benefits, I told him that I accepted the position and was looking forward to starting.  Several days passed with no updates from him, so I called him and emailed him asking when I could start the background check.  When he finally got back to me, it was to tell me that he had hired another candidate instead and was not interested in my application.  It seemed like I dodged a bullet because I do not want to work for someone who treats potential coworkers that way, but I don't know why he stopped responding to my communications promptly and hired someone else after I accepted the position, other than that he became annoyed when I asked for more details about the job instead of accepting the position right away.  No one should ever expect someone to accept a job without knowing what benefits were offered.\r\n\r\nI think USC Keck HR should audit how research hiring managers are interviewing and on-boarding new employees.
