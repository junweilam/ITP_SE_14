I arrived for my interview 10 minutes early.  Scheduled for 9:00 a.m.  (I was called to schedule this interview the day before and this was the only time option I was given) I sat and waited in the lobby.  I watched the staff go in and out.  During that time most of them acknowledged me.  At approx. 9:10 a.m. the receptionist guides me Behind the Front Desk to take a \u201ctest.\u201d  The test seemed simple.  While taking the test there were several conversations upfront including the receptionist and one of the staff members came over to me and introduced himself & shook my hand.  I said hello & explained I was taking a test.  Then at 9:20 a.m. the receptionist states my time is up.  I explained to him, I had no idea I was being timed. Then, I was escorted to the conference room of a panel of 6 people.  I was highly skilled for the position and dressed as a career person should be for an interview.  I felt as if they did not think I would stay there long, because of my experience.  If they felt that I was over qualified and would not stay, why would they call me for an interview to come in the next day.  I was very interested in the small location, the position and learning more about the team.  It is unfortunate that the people who are interviewing are not trained to do so.   I guess that is why it is taking them 6 months to fill the position.  It was last minute and a complete waste of my time.  They disrespected my time.

Went to the interview and it lasted almost 2 hrs I though it went really well the school director was very personable during the interview It felt like I had the job since it went so well. Unfortunately interviewing with the school director made it a bit confusing now that I think about it she almost made it seemed like I was in, we even went into a personal convo while I was there. Anyway 2 days passed and she called me back for a second interview(even though she had said initially she wasn't going to do second interviews) last minute the same day I got the call. So I went in and interviewed with the school director and an admission rep. It seemed odd the admissions rep was doing most of the talking while on the second interview ultimately I was like Ok whatever i went along. After the second interview they said \"we will let you know the status eitherway\". 4 days passed and nothing, I ended up emailing/calling and the school director  i was told she was not in..I wanted  to know what the status was because i was interested in the position. Long story when I called the ppl that answered the phone they gave me the run around which I though was disorganized  and unprofessional just because they said they were going to do something and they didn't. It doesn't take long for someone to email \"the position has been filled\" ok cool now I can move on... although  when I had called they were like \"call back tomorrow\" so I called \"oh she not here again I'll pass the message expect a call in 2 days\". blah blah blah!!
