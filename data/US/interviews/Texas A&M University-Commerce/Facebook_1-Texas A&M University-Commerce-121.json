Basically, the primary supervisor asked me a few questions about my previous jobs, what my expectations were for working there, making sure that I fit the job and the job fit me. There was only one interview with the three supervisor, primary supervisor and then the day\\night leads. The interview started with ethics effectively. A rehash of the expectations. It was at this point the interviewer identified some of the harder core perceptions of the job - I would be a custodian. The people who I would be primarily surrounded with would act like I didn't exist. He advised me that there were really nice people who worked there but that the perception of the cleaning crew would be invisibility. After I was bought-in on that idea it proceeded to the technical aspects of the job, or rather, what I would have to do. Through out this phase of the interview he identified several of the tools necessary and basically \"quizzed' my knowledge of the tools. After getting through that portion, he went into the nitty-gritty of the job. Overall I felt like it was a very realistic interview, I went into the job knowing exactly what would be expected of me and what I would see in return.", "Interview Questions": "Responding to a potential health hazard in a manner safest for everybody involved or who could potentially be involved"}]]
