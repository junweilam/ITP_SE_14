There was one interviewer who deviated slightly and asked questions which built off prior responses, which allowed for more natural and reciprocal dialogue.  After multiple rounds of this, it's apparent that this style was chosen (at least in part) to decrease the candidate's ability to assess individual/group-based culture while increasing the company's own ability to do so to the candidate.

They are not. Eat their free pizza and chalk it up to a free meal. They will invariably hire a Brigham Young University student.

The best projects are ones that you used basic regression and classification techniques to perform an interesting, but routine, task with statistics. They are not research statisticians and do not care about *research* you have performed. They want you to speak about business and customer outcomes.  As long as you are fundamentally sound on basic statistics, they are not going to ask you any questions that you cannot answer. \r\n\r\nYou may be asked to do some simple programming in R. Know how to use glm() in R. Knowing some support vector (e1071) stuff may also be helpful. \r\n\r\nIt overall looked like a nice enough place to work. Pretty clean.

From 10 am to 11 am we had networking sections, and from 11 am to 12 pm we had 1:1 interviews for over eight different positions. The interviews were all behavioral questions, very similar to any generic interview question you will see out there. There were no technical questions, so I was not able to show my skills. Lunch took the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nThe process was very long, very tiring. However they showed that they cared about the process, and that they were very serious about it. They even had a whole scheduled planed for what would be the process from that day to the start of the internship. They told us that we would receive an answer by December 9, 2016, but that did not happened. I sent a email to 2 people that work with HR recruitment there to know if the process was still going, but they did not replied back. In January 26, 2017, over two months after the interview, and over a month after the date they told us that they would send the results. I was not even expecting an answer anymore.\r\n\r\nThus, It was very disappointing. I have no problem not getting a offer, but they were a little disrespectful. It was lame to spent about five hours there, having to drive about 2 hours both ways, and miss work and classes for just a behavioral interview that in the end made me think for over a month that they would not answer and be ignored by email.

I was a very good fit for this role, exactly as per description.\r\nThe 'funny stuff' has started happening after the interview.\r\nImmediately after my visit I did follow-up with a nice and short 'thank you' letter to the hiring manager re-affirming my interest and positive experience based on my visit. That was the last week of May 2016. Then there was a long, very long silence. After about three weeks I had decided to follow-up again with another e-mail re-affirming my interest.\r\nAbout 10 days later, a letter with a request for five (5!!! direct and recent!) recommendations came. sure enough, they outsourced this process to another firm that has the references to register (!) and upload their letters (!!) into their system... Leaving aside the fact that one can get direct positive recommendations from five people in organization one is currently employed in, without jeopardizing current employment, is only one's firm wants to get rid of you. Besides, even if it was reasonable to find five references (which I did), who is going to bother with going some place, uploading something? How would I know if they did? Anyway, I have been able to get the references completed.\r\nA month later another HR person finally got back with me saying that the 'original' HR person was on leave, and she could not reach me by phone (granted, I did have my personal phone die on a trip I took)... but she did not even bother to write an e-mail... duh? Okay, with that 'confusion' out of the way... took another good two weeks to receive a call back verbally confirming that I was the best candidate (for what I know they could have interviewed a sizable squad of people over that period of time, it was already the very end of June!)... Well, so far so good? The HR person kind of relegated the responsibility for the delays to the hiring manager, so that they 'work together with a Consultant to work out an offer' for me (???)... Then some random phone calls from HR started, with no apparent goals. They made it seem that the offer of some kind is being put together, but no talk of a starting date, or anything relevant, was done.\r\nI kindly said that the salary figure looked acceptable to me, and that I would like to receive an offer. The HR drone said it would be coming in '15 minutes'... Needless to say, did I get to see it in 15 minutes, or by the end of that day, or the next Monday. This was already ridiculous beyond any reason. \r\nFinally, now that the 'offer' came as an e-mail from the HR, that had only the salary in it, and no (nada!) any vital information about pretty much any other conditions of the employment. No formal letter, no signatures of any kind, not even a copy to a Hiring manager or anyone with any kind of executive latitude.\r\nAt this point, what I think is going on is they have their own 'right' candidate but they need me out of the way voluntarily, as the panel has chosen me in the interview process, so they >> have to << try and hire me, but if they make it ridiculous I would just move on and they invite their brother in faith (or a cousin three times removed, who knows?) with open arms.\r\nWell, I am not giving this kind of satisfaction :) I am waiting for that offer. Still waiting. Needless to say I won't be going to work in that spider can - just want come closure for myself.\r\nUpdate: It's September, I finally turned that thing down.

The first interview is usually a group interview including several candidates.  During the group interview, the HR interviewer will ask each candidate to introduce themselves to the group and give the group a scenario to discuss.

The first round is by the hiring manager.  Often the first round will be with other team members.  The second round of interviews is by the hiring managers boss and possibly by some additional individuals the candidate may interact with.  Intermountain is notoriously slow in the hiring process.  If they make an offer they try and make you feel as though there is no room for negotiations.  Sometimes this is the case but usually there is a little bit of wiggle room in salary negotiations.  Just know that the initial salary is very important because the annual raises are horrible and rarely keep up with inflation.  Salary compression is very prevalent among folks that have been there more than a few years.
