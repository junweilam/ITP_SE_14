Several weeks went by, and again I was invited for another interview this time with a recruiter. After the interview the recruiter sent me an email requesting 5 references, that included 3 prior managers. At this stage in the process, I was convinced I was a 'shoe-in' for the job. I contacted my references, (all of which were happy to vouch for me) and submitted it to the recruiter. Several days go by without so much as a phone call from anyone in the company so I took the initiative and called the recruiter, who informed me that he was waiting on some feedback from the director of sales, that I needed to do nothing else and await a response.  I waited several more weeks with no word for the anyone within that organization, I once again contacted them, this time the district sales manager (whom was very pleasant to talk too.) after taking several deep breaths, he finally said the company had decided to go with someone else!!

I was contacted by an HR rep for the PMO manager opportunity.  I had an initial phone screen and was scheduled to meet with the SVP to discuss the role. After meeting with her, she recommended for me to come back for a second round of interviews, this time including a case question. This is where the process went bad. The HR rep who had initially recruited me for the role ended up leaving the company and I was told that a new HR person would be handling my file. I didn't think anything of it since I already made it to the final round of interviews and hopefully would do well enough for an offer to be made. The round of interviews went well and I was subsequently emailed a reference form to fill out and send to 5 professional references.  On this email was when I noticed that the role on the reference form was a completely different role than what I had interviewed for. Confused, I contacted the new HR rep who was completely unprofessional. I emailed him inquiring about the mishap...no response. I would call...no response. Finally over a week later he responds saying \"we feel that you are better suited for this other (junior) role.\" Mind you, I had never actually spoken to him before and the role was never discussed at any point in time during my interview process. I even contacted the former HR rep and he confirmed that I was only being considered for the role that I had interviewed for. After asking the new HR rep to confirm with the SVP, he then lied and said that he had verified this information. Still confused, at with no other options at this point, I contacted the SVP myself to confirm what was going on. Mind you, I had already spent about a month or so interviewing for this role. She then confirmed my position and stated that I was not being considered for the role that the HR rep mentioned and that basically he was incorrect. She asked me to continue filling out the reference sheet, and that she would correct the mishap. I then sent out 6 professional references, urging them to write my references quickly in order to speed up the process. After getting them all to submit within about a day or 2, I then waited another 2 weeks to hear back from HR. Only to get an automated email stating that I was no longer being considered for the junior role! (nevermind the fact that it was still referencing the incorrect role). Confused, I emailed the HR rep who of course had no response. I suspect he was upset that I had gone over his head to contact the SVP . I then contacted her again and then was told that \"I was actually been considered for the correct role still, but that because I contacted her, it showed poor judgement and now I wouldnt get the role\". Crazy. One of the main rules as a PM is to escalate when decisions must be made and the individuals at the table are not able to make these decisions. I have no idea what she would expect anyone to do when they have spent between 1-2 months of their time interviewing for a particular role and then HR is so out of wack that they have you slated for a completely different role and are lying about validating this information rather than just taking the time to validate and rectify it.
