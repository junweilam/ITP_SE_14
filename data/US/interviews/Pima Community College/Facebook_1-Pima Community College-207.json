I read the job description four times to develop questions to ask in the interview,  one of the interviewers was dismissive of my questions and made comments that made me appear oblivious to the role. I don't think she had read the job description but held the role prior.  Realistically, I just don't think I was their \"type\" meaning departmental fit and that happens sometimes. Although some departments need to work on implicit hiring biases, we all have them.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, I received a personal rejection email that was writing in a font used for comic strips, it was hard to read, and gave the impression that I couldn't take the person in this position seriously. I've  used the font several times in marketing materials for children, but you have to increase the size of it to make it easier to read, it has too many quirky tails, but I would never use it compose  business/workplace emails. It screams unprofessional to me. I believe presentation is everything, especially from someone who would be my boss, I want to learn by example. This was my dream job with a staple in the Tucson community, wasn't in the cards. I would apply for jobs at Pima again, just not that department.", "Interview Questions": "The questions are about role, no behavioral interview questions, which is great, since I'm an introvert, it's harder for introverts to interview, it doesn't feel like a conversation but an interrogation.
