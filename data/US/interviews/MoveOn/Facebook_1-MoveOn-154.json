I moved to the second round which was a multi-part writing and editing assignment. That\u2019s where it got weird. I did the assignments as requested and they asked for me to provide the reasoning/methodology behind my writing topics. I received a reply saying I wasn\u2019t advancing, which is fine, it happens. Yet, I\u2019ve noticed that when I receive MoveOn emails, they are slowly incorporating a number of my writing suggestions from my samples. On one hand, it\u2019s nice to see they took some of my advice.
