It was a group interview, but I did not anticipate to walk into a room with over 20 candidates. We each got 30 seconds to introduce ourselves, which is impractical. They also made us spend 5 min with a partner, and then we had 30 seconds to tell them why they should hire our partner for the position. They didn\u2019t really allow us anytime for them to get to know us. I doubt with the combined 1 minute of information they learned about us, they were even able to keep track with 20 other girls in the room. Towards the end of this process we find out that they were only filling one position. So it made no sense to have that many women in a room for one position. They definitely should\u2019ve narrowed it down drastically before wasting everyone\u2019s time. I say everyone, because they reposted the job application a few hours after our interview on indeed.

She/he emailed after looking at my resume and was very interested to meet. We briefly emailed back and forth and settled on later that week. Once the day came, I arrived at the school and waited to meet w/ a panel of individuals. The interview went VERY well, which was followed by a campus tour. At the conclusion of the interview & tour (roughly 1.5 hours), I was told they had a few more interviews and I would hear from them in a week.\r\n\r\nA week later, I received a call from one of the people that was in the interview...one of the employees who wasn't there in the panel interview wanted to meet with me. We met later that week! The interview went so well, I thought I'd be offered the position on the spot. I was escorted back to the main office where I had my background check done and they gave me directions for where to go to do my drug test. SUCCESS....or so I thought! \r\n\r\nBefore leaving, again I'm told it would be a week so I waited. After a week, I emailed to follow-up and make sure they had everything they needed as I also had to do an online assessment. With my application file complete, I wait and wait to hear about their decision. NO response. So I call and leave a voice message, again no response.  I email my contact who I had been talking with through this whole process and basically say since they had not contacted me I assumed they went with other candidates and wished them well...only to receive a response, she/he was soo swamped and they had still not made a decision but they would by the end of week. \r\n\r\nI'm sure I don't have to tell you, I still  haven't heard from them.

The job posting said \"Bachelor degree preferred.\" I let him know that I did not have a degree, and he let me know that my experience trumped a degree, and scheduled me for a F2F the next morning.  I arrived to my appointment five minutes early, but the office I was to go to was locked. After waiting by the door for a few minutes, an instructor showed up and was able to let me in the office. The receptionist finally came out from a back office, and asked me what I was there for. After telling her I was there to interview, the Campus President came out, and again confirmed why I was there, and then disappeared into the back office. Finally, about 10 minutes after my scheduled interview, the CP came back out and told me that the person I was to interview with wouldn't be there that morning, but he would meet with me. He told me, as well, that experience trumped education, however, throughout our conversation, he kept insulting me by mentioning the fact that I was \"uneducated.\" After we spoke for roughly 15 minutes, he ended the interview, and said that he had a meeting to go to, but that the Director of Admissions would be calling me to schedule another appointment. After not hearing from the DOA, I emailed the CP to inquire about the status of my next interview. He replied that the DOA had another \"route\" in mind, and that I would not be scheduled for another interview. The entire time I was at my original appointment, and after receiving the email from the CP, I feel like they never had any intention of seriously considering me for the position, and that my trip to their location was a complete waste of my time, and gas.
