I was emotionally manipulated and lied to from the beginning by the hiring manager who phoned me up on WhatsApp on the first day of the process to tell me how great she thought I would be for the role. After successfully completing 3 interviews and a technical test, her inappropriate phone calls telling me how much of a great organisational fit I was, and even in evening hours, continued. She even pushed me to negotiate my salary/conditions and told me that TNC would never reject me for doing that, and that I should empower myself to do so because for women this is something we find very difficult. After this, she requested 3 professional references from me which confirmed to me that they were contacted by her. After this process, I received what I believe was an informal offer from her by phone. As recommended by her, I tried to negotiate, but about holidays rather than salary as money wasn't my main motivation. I asked for some minimum holidays during the first year as Colombian labour law doesn't allow holidays in your first year of a job, and I understood that as an international org, they may be able to have some flexibility on this one. After this conversation, I could sense the hiring manager turning cold and becoming very strange with me. A few days later, I received a rejection email. I was honestly shocked and gobsmacked at the lack of professionalism and the inappropriateness that took place in the process. In total, it was around 2 months of my time wasted and really knocked my confidence.

I provided TNC with a completed online form, a resume, and a cover letter. TNC contacted me for a 30-minute phone interview, asked me to complete a take-home exercise (a cover letter-type question), and then invited me to take part in x2 45-minute panel interviews. From the application\u2019s submission to the first-panel interview: 71 days. - Panel 1 asked very generic interview questions, with little connection to the role. I was left with the impression that the panelists were unenthusiastic and cared little about the interview. - Panel 2 was far more engaged. Questions related to the role, professional experiences, and work challenges. The panelists were enthusiastic, asked deep and thoughtful questions, and were highly amicable. After the interview, it took TNC an additional 15 days to reject my candidacy (for context, it took less time for Apollo 11 to go to the moon and back, the Russian Army to mobilize in WW1, and for the Committee on Style and Arrangement to finalize the U.S. Constitution). Moreover, I was led to believe that TNC Human Resources would provide further updates on the application. Up to this point, TNC\u2019s HR had been extremely courteous and professional. However, and to my confusion, Panel 1 got back and provided the now somewhat clich\u00e9 rejection message, \u201c\u2026While your background and experiences were interesting and impressive, after much deliberation we have decided to move forward with another candidate.\u201d I acknowledged the message and asked for feedback. TNC provided the following out-of-office: \u201cHappy Holidays! I am out of the office until the end of the year, and will not be checking email. Thank you for your understanding.\u201d Happy Holidays indeed! TNC commits to making the process \u201ca positive experience.\u201d However, the 15 days TNC took to communicate and reject my candidacy, the internal confusion over follow-up, and the generic, flippant even, manner TNC gave me their decision made this far from a positive experience. The public holds NGOs like TNC to a higher standard. NGOs must endeavor to ensure their approach to recruitment is considerate, especially for candidates that battle through a lengthy recruitment process. Remedy is straightforward: 1) Remind hiring managers that unsuitable candidates need timely rejections. 2) Encourage hiring managers to provide feedback, especially if the process is long and laborious. 3) Ensure that company hiring managers and Human Resources are communicating. 4) Discourage hiring managers from sending rejections while on Holiday Leave. It is unprofessional and inconsiderate. (It also makes you wonder why TNC is instructing their hiring managers to communicate rejections on leave). I am utterly soured by this experience and believe it may show some inner organizational dysfunction. Time is precious, and I am left with the feeling that TNC was comfortable wasting my time. Time put into the application, take-home exercise, phone calls, interview prep., and follow-up emails could have been better spent elsewhere. For prospective candidates, I hope the above is informative and enables you to consider whether you wish to go through such a process in your search for a conservation career.
