I inquired for a status by email.  The person I emailed forwarded my email request to someone closer to the process.  That was the last I heard.  I was disappointed to not be offered the position, although upon further consideration, I realized I was not what they were looking for.  However, I would think that it's common courtesy to let interviewees know either way.  I was more disappointed in the way this was handled than not actually getting an offer.   I can't speak to whether this is standard for this employer or if it just happened to be more indicative of the department to which I applied.
