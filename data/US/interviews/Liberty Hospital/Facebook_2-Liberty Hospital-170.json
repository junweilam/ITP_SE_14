I work night shift and state around for 2 hours because my interview was scheduled for 8 am the next day.  The person I was scheduled to meet with was late.  Then when She did arrive she ignored me.  She made almost no eyecontact and was frequently interrupted with phone calls and staff.  Someone barged in to tell her how someone failed to do something and she barked about how that person would need to be written up.  Then she just asked if I had questions for her.  There was no actual interview or chance for me discuss my experience!  It was a waste of time and a complete joke!!!!  Especially after HR just told me how I was going to be informed of certification opportunities and how I would eat a bonus for the 5 years of time in grade I've spent here.  None of that was addressed in the\"interview.\". Basically I was an inconvenience to my interviewer.  This place is a JOKE and after 5 years of work at the lowest pay in the region I am DONE!  Do NOT waste your time with these people!
