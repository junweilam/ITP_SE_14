She basically stated the job description and set me up for an in-person interview the following week on at their Orlando, FL location near the campus of UCF.  \r\n\r\nRed Flag #1 The recruiter followed-up several times prior to the interview. She called the day before to ask if I was ready or nervous. She even called the morning of the interview while I was attempting to get to my interview. The recruiter  she was pushing you to be sure you attend your interview because I'm guessing it's part of their pay plan.  I honestly spoke to the recruiter more times than I did my own friends and family during the process. There's a big difference between follow-up and overkill, I felt like I was answering the phone from a telemarketer.\r\n\r\nI walked through a very crowded call center into the interview room. There were 3 people present. The Director of Admissions, a manager and a superior of the admissions director that was observing there work.  The interview were your typical behavior STAR questions.\r\n\r\nRed Flag #2:  I inquired as to why the position was open and they stated it was due to growth. Unfortunately, I prefer honest answers.  They layoff every year in this department and they give you cold leads. I also made sure I did not let them know I knew many employees that are currently employed with the company all of which said they would not recommend working of the company. They were also seeking someone to Tuesday-Sunday.  (So that means you'll never be compensated for holidays that are observed on Mondays).\r\n\r\nRed Flag #3  I asked why have their enrollments decreased year over year and what is their target enrollment numbers for year-end 2017.  The response from the director was it is due to the guidelines/restrictions from the department of education.  The accurate information is that Kaplan University has been cited for improper recruitment practices and has been riddled with lawsuits. I also have a friend that has been paid out in a class action lawsuit because of this.\r\n\r\nRed Flag #4 The interviewers asked about my years of employment, which felt like an age discriminatory question.

She said anyone stepping into Admissions role will have to work two nights a week until 8pm, two nights until 6pm (Fridays the office closes at 4pm) and then usually come in for overtime on Saturdays 2 or 3 weeks out of the month.
