Received a phone call from the hiring manager three weeks later requesting a phone interview. Completed the phone interview and then was invited for a second interview in person a week later with two members of the administrative team for the department. After that interview was invited to a THIRD interview with the three physicians that this position would be supporting. Prior to the third interview was emailed a PDF containing information on the benefits available at VUMC along with another PDF explaining how their PTO program works. After both the second and third interviews was given an extensive tour of the area that this position would be working in and during both the second and third interviews, those that I was interviewing kept using the verbage \"you will be doing this\" \"you will be supporting these people\" \"This is where you will be sitting\". In an email that was received from one of the administrative staff members that I met with in the second interview she even stated that my skills and experience would allow me to be very successful in this position. One day after the third interview I received an email indicating that they wanted to obtain my references. VUMC uses an electronic reference service called Skill Survey. I was REQUIRED to provide FIVE references, two of which HAD to be either current or former managers. Hence I was very excited as normally reference checking is done prior to an offer for employment being extended. Thus I submitted the required information and sent the invitation to my references to fill out the form. I even ENSURED that they filled it out within twenty four hours as that is something that the Skill Survey notes in the summarized/aggregated report that is sent over to the hiring manager, how long it took your references to respond. The summarized report was sent late on a Thursday afternoon and by Monday afternoon I had not heard a word from the hiring manager and so I reached out to them. NOTHING, CRICKETS. Not happy at all, so I reached out to the person from the administrative staff that had emailed me previously and this person did respond to me. Unfortunately and quite shockingly they told me that I had STELLAR references, yet for some reason they saw the need to continue interviewing people and would be getting back to me in a couple of weeks?!! What in the heck?!! Had I known that they were not going to be offering me the job and were still interviewing people I would have NEVER provided my references, as it was a COMPLETE waste of my time and most importantly the people that I put down for my references time, and it was a bit embarrassing too, as I have NEVER heard of a company checking your references, having them come back great and then not offering you the job, but instead choosing to continue interviewing people.
