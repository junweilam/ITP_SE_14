I never heard back until October when they called me in for a 6 hour interview. I got interviewed by 11 different people over the course of the day. Overall, the questions were pretty standard. There was nothing surprising if you've prepared. The interviewers all seemed like they'd be good coworkers, they all seemed passionate about their jobs and seemed like they enjoyed their work.\r\n\r\nThe position reported to 3 (or maybe 4...I'm not even sure because it was so convoluted) different people who all had competing interests, and all 3 (or 4) expressed their interests were the most crucial. I suppose that's human nature, and I would place the negative connotations from that on the structure and not the individuals. Of the 11 interviewers, there were different levels of desire outwardly expressed about changing the structure- I suspect it won't change any time soon. There seemed to be quite a disconnect from one functional area to the next. Each interviewer explained the administrator role in a completely different way, even to the point that I looked stupid as I repeated earlier explanations. At one point an interviewer literally laughed as I repeated what was told to me. I don't say this to be negative at all- just an honest assessment of what I saw. No job is going to be all sunshine and rainbows and this one is no different.\r\n\r\nIn so far as an interview can be a \"positive\" or \"enjoyable\" experience, I'd say MCW did pretty well.
