My experience with her was quick, straightforward  and professional. My gripe is more so with the hiring manager. Totally unprofessional. I\u2019m not sure if Cedars Sinai is going through a rebranding or culture shift, but whatever it may be, it\u2019s apparent something is happening. I\u2019ve had other peers who share similar experiences. Employees of any organization are considered \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d the day they accept an offer. It\u2019s clear that the hiring manager is the result of unchecked bad behavior and unprofessionalism. I arrive 15 mins early to their offices, which is standard for most candidates. The interview was to take place at 9am and I had to wait 35 mins. My time is as valuable as anyone else\u2019s. Often, when an employer is running behind, they let you know and apologize. The hiring manager seemly called me to a conference room for the interview and said nothing en route there. She did not tell me that it was a panel interview, which is fine for me since I enjoy interviewing. It would have been nice to know the interview set up before hand. It was obvious the hiring manager pulled 2 additional people to be in on the interview and they had absolutely no background in what I was applying for. They were asking unrelated random questions and I had to keep throwing my work experiences in, to steer the interview back on track. They asked me questions all at the same time. The most detrimental thing the hiring manager said to me was that she\u2019s a \u201cmicro-manager\u201d.  I pretty much checked out after that and was just hoping for the interview to be over. Very awkward and uncomfortable for no reason. I am a veteran of the military so I can handle pressure and shake-up. The total disregard for not only my time but the other candidates time as well.  I can only imagine how patients are treated. I\u2019ll probably never apply with this organization again unless I hear of organizational change. As of 12/7/2019, it has been 72 days since my interview and I still haven\u2019t gotten a response on if the position was fulfilled. I would have gladly declined if an offer was extended.

I first interviewed with the director for 15 minutes. He asked me basic questions such as my educational backgrounds, my work experience, etc. Then he asked me if I knew about the basic research his lab was conducting. The next interview was done conducted by an MD/PhD. The third interviewer was the lab manager. The fourth and and fifth interview was done together by a PhD and another Research Associate. This one was the hardest because the PhD grilled me about the different genes and experiments related to the research. I've worked in a research lab before, but it was focused on diabetes. This research was focused on a totally different subject. I answered everything to the best of my ability, and honestly. After all the interviews have been conducted, the director then told me that he would let me know by the middle of next week.
