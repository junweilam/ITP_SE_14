[[{"date": "25 Mar 2015", "title": "Case Manager Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1+ week.\u00a0I interviewed at Transition House (Santa Barbara, CA) in Oct 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "There are always two interviews for this position. The first is with only the Program Director and one other person (maybe two).  If you are considered a strong candidate, you will be invited to a second interview that is attended by ALL the other case managers, as well as the Program Director.  It can be intimidating to walk into a conference room and sit at a table with 7 or 8 people you don't know.  However, there's usually a lot of laughter and friendly faces (I've now sat in quite a few of these interviews on the others side).", "Interview Questions": "This job involves lots of follow up after meeting with each client family, such as making referrals to other agencies, updating/involving co-workers, creating a case presentation each week for program committee meetings, taking notes at meetings & documenting everything.  If you have 7 to 9 cases, how would you manage all of these details, making sure you followed up on everything?"}], []]
