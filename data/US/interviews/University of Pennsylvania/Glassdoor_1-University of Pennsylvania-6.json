He asked me to email back within a week if I didn't hear anything regarding a written offer.\r\n\r\nOne week went by and I emailed, as requested; the ED said he would get back to me \"ASAP.\"\r\n\r\nAnother week went by and I emailed to follow-up. This time, I received no response.\r\n\r\nI then emailed in a bit over a week and, again, received no response.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this last email I called the administrative assistant who setup the interview originally, not having any other numbers available, and she let me know that, although she didn't have the ED's phone number (they had just moved offices, I was told), she would pass along to him that I called.\r\n\r\nTwo days after that\u2014a full month after the interview\u2014I called the ED, whose number I located in the online directory.

Less than five minutes later I receive an email from another administrative assistant informing me that I was not selected for the position.\r\n\r\nEveryone with whom I have shared this saga has found it ironic that the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law (Center) would drag out the application process in this manner. I would have understood had the ED walked back his offer shortly after the interview or in response to any of the numerous emails I sent to follow-up. But to lead me on\u2014to say that he would get back to me \"ASAP\" and then fail to respond to follow-up emails\u2014and then to choose to withhold from me, over the phone, that I was no longer in the running, choosing instead to have me find this out over email, a few minutes later, was simply poor form and unprofessional.\r\n\r\nI know that the Center does excellent work, admire their faculty and publications, and hope to engage with them at some point in the future.

They didn't even acknowledge that I came from out of state on my own dime, last minute, and rearranged my schedule to meet with them.\r\n\r\nI never heard from them again (surprise) except when HR sent me an email saying that this position matched my profile and inviting me to apply for it\u2026 it was the same position I had just interviewed for a month earlier! And my HR profile was marked as 'interviewed' so it seemed pretty obvious.\r\n\r\nIt also seemed obvious that no one communicates with one another and they don't know what they want, they just like to 'window shop' candidates. It seems that neither of these positions have been filled.\r\n\r\nI'm sure Penn has the cream of the crop to pick from because they are certainly acting as such.

I would recommend applying the day the job is posted to get in the pool of applications that actually get received. There was a scheduled phone interview where I was asked questions like \"Describe yourself\", \"Describe how you handle stress\", \"What is your experience with MS Office?\", very basic, non-behavioral based interview questions. After a successful phone interview, I did a 1:1 interview with the Assistant Dean of the dept., who was nice and asked several of the same questions in the phone interview. Then I was sent to a series of panel interviews that combined lasted about 3 hours. The questions were all focused on my skill sets and past performances. \r\n\r\nPerception of the office: It seemed to me that the people who worked there were rather cold and professional, and one woman indicated that I would be everyone's servant (without actually saying that, but she impressed that idea quite firmly) and that I would have to deal with people who were in bad moods often (again, not her exact words, but the general idea). I came away from the interview not wanting the position. I do not know who they hired for the job, but the last person who held the job had a master's and was working on a Phd...so obviously extremely overqualified for a job that requires a minimum h.s. diploma. \r\nThe salary seems fair with the market, $30,000 for an admin. assistant job.", "Interview Questions": "Questions were generally easy, and no behavioral based interview questions (example \"Tell me about a time when you...), which was fortunate because I'm pretty sure everyone hates those questions."}, {"date": "8 Oct 2013", "title": "Postdoctoral Research Fellow Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 months.\u00a0I interviewed at University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA) in Sept 2009", "Interview Descriptions": "Job advertised with Science Careers.
