First it was a questionnaire, then a virtual interview with two panelists. This was followed by a full written interview and then another final interview with a different set of panelists. The entire process took 4 months to be finalized. To be taken through the entire agonizing process and dropped last minute was a traumatizing experience I would not want to undergo again. I wish they had a system of eliminating candidates at each stage of the interview to only remain with one candidate for vetting during the final meeting with the Senior Management Team", "Interview Questions": "If you discover fraud by a sub-awardee, what would be your advice to the Management team?"}, {"date": "14 May 2021", "title": "Director Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Last Mile Health", "Interview Descriptions": "1hr long with 5 mins of intro from the interviewers.

I submitted an application and heard back two days later requesting me to fill out a questionnaire. It asked why I was interested in the organization, my salary expectations, etc. I had 72 hours to complete it and submitted it on a Saturday evening. At 2am on Monday morning, I was asked to do a video interview the following day -- Tuesday. I thought it was strange that the hiring panel was able to review my responses and discuss over a weekend... and at a such a late time. I also was surprised at the times they offered me to interview, both the next day either in the morning (9am) or late afternoon (3pm) during the workday. If we weren't working remotely, I'm not sure I would have been able to make the interview work.\nI thought the interview went well, despite me not having much time to prep, I felt I answered every question. I have more than double the years of experience working at a much larger global NGO doing external communications for executive leadership, but it's very possible I just wasn't what they were looking for. In the end, I am glad the process moved quickly even if it was not in my favor. Perhaps wasn't a good fit for either of us - I would have been the only person of color on the comms team and also the salary for a senior manager role was not comparable to other similar organizations.

I learnt from him about an open position in finance and was invited for two in-person interviews in the company's office in Boston. One interview was with the Director and the other one was with a partnership officer. \r\n\r\nI had a very positive impression overall. The first interviewer asked me questions about my background, MBA program, and why I would like to work in a non-profit organization. The interview turned to be more like a conversation and he demonstrated strong knowledge of the sector and business/finance aspects of non-profit firms. He was also very excited to share experience from his trip to Liberia. Both interviewers seemed to be very inspired to work at Last Mile Health and help people in remote places in Liberia. The organization has ambitious goals to scale up their model and have more impact on communities in Africa. My impression is that there is a very friendly and encouraging work environment, smart team, and it would definitely be a great place to work. \r\n\r\nI was informed that the position was put on hold unfortunately. However, the interviewer was very kind and supportive and offered me to connect with other professionals in non-profit organizations in the Boston area. He introduced me to several managers with a recommendation and I had successful interviews with those firms.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no offer from Last Mile, I had a very positive interviewing experience and learnt a lot during the process. I was already interested in pursuing a career in the non-profit sector, but I became even more excited after speaking with both interviewers at Last Mile.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you interested in Last Mile Health?"}, {"date": "5 Aug 2015", "title": "Human Resources Coordinator Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Last Mile Health (Boston, MA)", "Interview Descriptions": "Two standard phone interviews followed by a more in-depth phone interview with the Director of Finance and Administration. The first two interviews were fine, but wow, the Director of Finance and Administration was horrendous. He was pretentious and condescending in the interview and could not answer why he chose to work at Last Mile Health. When I asked, he essentially said that his friend got him the job and that he \"figured he should do something good for the world before the end of career.\" He had no previous experience in the sector and was very patronizing in his choice of words. Talk about toxic for a nonprofit. He also \"left me with a riddle\" to solve and email back to him. Are you joking? This was for a human resources coordinator position.

For case based questions, I was presented with various situations in the field and asked how I would approach it.

A series of situation-based questions were asked which let me intrigued and more interested in the organization. The final round was with the interim EMD over the phone and was basically around why I want to work with LMH and how do I organize my day. Overall it was a very positive expereince and there was a quick follow up after every round. I was very satisfied with the process. My direct supervisor was Director fo Finance and Administration who also joined the same date. He served as a great mentor to me during my initial time and provided great leadership to  the department. I felt lucky to be part of such a tight-knit and supportive team.
