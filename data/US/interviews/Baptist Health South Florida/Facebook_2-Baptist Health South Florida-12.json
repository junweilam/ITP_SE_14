Then she went through my experience, she didn\u2019t have all of it, so I mentioned that there was more to my resume, in the nicest way I could muster, since all of her questions and her flippant attitude seemed unnecessarily accusatory and critical. She mentioned that I should go back and fill it in, hostility palpable in her voice. She opened my resume PDF, it only took her one click, and saw all of my experience. Six-years-worth for this particular position, she was still accusatory, but then the hostility reached a fever pitch, she saw that I still have a year and a few months to finish my degree, I took a break to have my son a few years ago. She became extremely derogatory, her commentary borderline insulting. I had to stop her and tell her that I was not interested in continuing the interview process with her company. Wished her luck on her search and hung up. She told me, \u201cI would have to see if the people in the Marketing department would be comfortable working with someone like you.

If you do not have ties with someone who already works there or know someone in the HR dept., getting a recruiter to take your application into consideration is, almost impossible.  My best advice to qualified candidates waiting for an HR  recruiter to contact you for an interview: DO NOT WAIT around for a call. Be proactive and call HR yourself. Continue to apply and be persistent & consistent with your application. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY & CALL follow up with them after your application has been submitted. I have been applying to Baptist Health for quiet a while & when I say quiet a while I mean more than 12 months. Afraid that I would annoy the recruiters with my calls and inquires, and possibly having them discard my applications I never really called them. Later I realized that calling the HR dept can actually benefit you because who better that you to speak with them and explain to them that you posses the talent they are searching for? ....  To my surprise a recruiter actually answered the phone & I used that opportunity to professionally shine! Little said, the recruiter gave me a small phone interview and after asked me to come in & take the filling and typing test.  When I went in to take my exams, the testing process wasn't really explained in details.... so, you can only imagine how nervous and intimidated I became. IF YOU BECOME NERVOUS AND INTIMIDATED DO NOT LET THE RECRUITED SEE YOU DRIP A SWEAT! They want to see how well you work under pressure. The typing test was 5 minutes long ( If you are not a fast typer, I suggest getting a magazine & practice typing what you see quickly & with minimum errors. ) The Filling test is also easy, but just like the typing test, I would review a few tips and techniques to ACE your exam. I received a 100% on the filling and a rating of 62 WPM. The recruiter was not available for me to interview with once I completed my test, but I was told that the recruiter will reach out to me & schedule an interview.
