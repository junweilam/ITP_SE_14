I put in a lot of time and effort into this interview process, only for them to hire an internal candidate. I had 5 separate interviews. A phone screening, zoom with a panel, two interviews with the panel in person, and the last interview with the panel and actual manager. I was asked to prepare something and review it with the panel for my third interview. This task took me a lot of time/effort to prepare for. When I went to review it with the panel, I felt that they did not prepare me for presenting the task. I left feeling incompetent and embarrassed and not expecting to continue in the interview process. I was surprised to make the final interview. I was also asked the same questions in almost every interview, which made the process frustrating. The whole process took over two months from start to finish. Each interview was over a week apart. After the last interview, it took them almost two weeks to let me know whether I had gotten the job. The process took way longer than I had anticipated or would expect in the interview process (again, for an entry level position). I think once you get hired, this company is amazing, but they are not super up front about how extensive the interview process can be. They should also be more up front about internal candidates.

The people were very nice and it was a very encouraging experience.  This disappointment came in when at the end of the day I was finishing up with the executive recruiter and he was discussing next steps, I asked him what the timing would be in hearing back from them.  He said \"You are exactly what we are looking for, if I have may way you will have the job and we should be able to get in touch with you by the end of the week, possibly the beginning of the following week.\"  Well I didn't hear back from them for more than two weeks and it was by email.  My belief is if you fly to an organization for a face to face interview, you should be given the courtesy of a verbal conversation when not selected.  I ended up calling them to understand better what happened since I was told I was basically an ideal candidate.  It was a good conversation and I don't have any hard feelings, but it was a bit confusing and I felt I got several mixed messages.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you looking to work for us?"}, {"date": "9 Oct 2014", "title": "Email Marketing Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Compassion International in Mar 2014", "Interview Descriptions": "Had an initial phone interview which I thought went well although much of it was directed at your faith and coming to know Christ.
