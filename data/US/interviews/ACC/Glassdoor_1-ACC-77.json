Depends on the position.  Depending on how up the chain the position is, the larger the interview committee.  Generally 6-8 people will ask questions.  Anywhere from 30-60 minutes and presentations may be required.  Hard to get foot in the door at ACC but once in, positions are great. Acceptances can take another 2-3 weeks at a minimum.  Once the hiring committee agrees on a candidate, they send it to HR, who then does background checks and references.  Depending on time of year, it can take weeks before an offer comes through.  Quite a long, tedious process.", "Interview Questions": "Suppose you were the only one to open the advising center and there was a line out the door, the phone was ringing off the hook and an instructor adamantly needed copies or information all at the same time.
