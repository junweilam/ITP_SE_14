The first interview was a fantastic process and I really got the sense that they have a wonderful culture in the IT Building. Most of the questions were designed to get an understanding of how I handle certain situations and interact with others. They gave me the questions beforehand to allow me to prepare, but the interview was just a barrage of questions one at a time and I was unable to shift it to more of a conversational exchange. The panel hit me with 25 prepared questions over all, but I really liked their answers to my questions. To prepare for this, I wrote answers for all of the provided questions and gave everyone handouts, which they seemed to love. Next, there were two interviews back to back. First with more senior employees asking about technical experience, and then with management and the IT director. Overall the process was drawn out for my tastes, with panel interviews having as many as a dozen or more interviewers each. Still, they appear to have a healthier work culture than most organizations. After everything was done, I was offered 40k salaried, bottom of the range. The offer would be acceptable for an entry level tech, but unfortunately came across as rather insulting for a level three IT position. I attempted to reach out and give them the benefit of the doubt that there may be a clerical error or miscommunication, but received no response, so I immediately accepted a much higher paying position from one of the other companies I had been interviewing with. The offer was really the nail in the coffin. I largely enjoyed the process despite small issues, but I have to keep my career interests in mind, and the salary offer was simply so low that I could not possibly afford to accept.", "Interview Questions": "Describe a time that you had to make a difficult decision?
