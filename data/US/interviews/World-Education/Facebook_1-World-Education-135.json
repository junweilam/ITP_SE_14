I was asked to complete a phone screening with a PA on a holiday who had only been with the company for a few months. From what I'd gathered, she has only done administrative work and was not accustomed to interviewing candidates. Her voice was shaky and she was clearly anxious, which made for an incredibly awkward interview. She also never asked me the standard \"tell me about yourself\" question and was unfamiliar with my resume so it was difficult to communicate my qualifications and experience. After the interview, there was no follow-up (despite sending a thank you), which I found really disrespectful and outdated. I was deterred by several Glassdoor reviews which state mismanagement and a lack of internal communication. My interview experience only confirms these perspectives. I have since been offered a position that pays substantially more and will not be applying for any further positions at World Education.", "Interview Questions": "What do you know about the company?"}, {"date": "30 Apr 2020", "title": "Operations Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at World Education", "Interview Descriptions": "Phone call for about 30 minutes.

The phone interview was pretty standard and was with the PO and Manager. Lasted 45mins, and contained all the basic interview questions. A few days later I was contacted by email again inviting me for an in-person interview for the following week. I live outside of Boston and they paid for plane ticket (up to $400) and one night of hotel and taxi/uber to and from the interview (which is amazing considering its a non-profit). The in-person interview lasted one hour and was with a different PO, Manager (same one) and the regional VP. The interview was again pretty standard, no surprises. After the interview (still at the office) I took an excel \"test\". Very basic excel skills. Followed by a short writing \"test.\" After all was complete, I was told that they would have a decision within a few weeks. Never heard from them again. \r\n\r\nThe overall experience was pretty positive. However, I find it very unprofessional to not follow up with a final candidate (especially if they traveled out of state for the interview) notifying them that they did not get an offer.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us about your past budget experience.
