I had a phone interview with the hiring manager, and was asked to create a mock email for alumni asking for university donations. After this (about 4 days later) they asked that I create some design examples for their Dolphin Dash initiative. After another 3-4 days, they requested an in person interview. Talk of compensation wasn't discussed at this point. The on-campus interview was from 9:30 AM-11:30 AM (I had to take personal PTO for this). I met with the marketing team who interviewed me (3 individuals) and then met with the advancement team (another 3 people). They were very friendly - both of those interviews lasted about 25 minutes. After this the hiring manager and the director took me on a golf cart tour of the university. This felt very strange as I had not been given an offer, or even discussed compensation yet. They sat down with me at their boathouse area and felt like they were trying to smooze me into wanting to accept a low offer. When the director found out I had a daughter, she kept saying things about the 'work flexibility' to be off on fridays during the summer and a winter break. That all is great, but not for crappy pay. I never heard back from them. A tip for future interviews- follow up with your interviewees. Don't tell them 'we love you and want to negotiate pay' and then never follow up. Over all it was a negative experience since I had to take PTO at my current job to go to the campus to have this strange experience. I heard the pay is around $40,000/year. They talk highly of benefits but that is simply put: not a livable wage.
