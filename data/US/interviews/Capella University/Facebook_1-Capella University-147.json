She asked four questions pertaining to the job. I felt that the questions and conversation went well. It actually went so well, that she stated that she would follow up early the following week. I followed up with my interview by sending an email saying that I was happy to be considered for the position. She never responded to that email. One day went by and I heard nothing. The second day went by and I heard nothing.  On day three I sent an email following up on my application status and she did not respond. I called on the fourth day and I received no answer. It has been one week with no response by email or phone. I am okay with not being selected for the position if that is the case. I am not okay with being told that they would follow up all to not hear one word. I have no idea what the issue is but I am not happy with how this process transpired. I am actually a student at Capella and I love the university, but this recruiting company, Strategic Education has greatly disappointed me! I feel completely disrespected by this whole ordeal.
