Very engaging and transparent, highly communicative, and she gave me tips for my interview with the hiring manager. I'd work with her again in a heartbeat. My actual interview experience was much less organized. Two people were supposed to interview me together, and only the hirng manager showed up. 15 minutes into the virtual interview the no-show told the hiring manager she had mixed up the days and couldn't make it. The hiring manager was also getting over a cold and seemed unfocused (totally understandable, but maybe she should have rescheduled). The questions she asked me were vague and had little to do with evaluating my skills or qualifications. I had a hard time answering any questions with the STAR method because the questions were so unfocused. We also didn't talk much about the type of projects that the person in this role would work on, which I thought was odd. She wrote next to nothing down during the entire interview. I'm a reasonably good conversationalist (I have a client-focused background), so I don't think that was the problem here. I got the impression she had something very specific in mind and I wasn't it, despite being completely qualified for the job. Also worth noting: I currently work at a fairly prestigious institution, and wondered if they might have been using me to benchmark salary bands. I sent a thank you through the recruitment team. The recruiter informed me four business days (and one weekend) later that I wouldn't move forward. No word from the hiring manager. FYI this position has been posted since at least November of 2022 - maybe longer. Honestly feel like I dodged a bullet. I never write Glassdoor reviews but this was definitely a waste of my time and I hope to spare others the same.
