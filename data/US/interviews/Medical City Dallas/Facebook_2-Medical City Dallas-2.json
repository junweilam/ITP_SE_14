First, the \"hiring manager\" was extremely young, not that a young person couldn't perform the job, but her lack of experience definitely showed. I don't have a problem with tattoos, piercings etc. but her winged eyeliner was extremely tacky and unprofessional. She was late for the interview, then she decided we chat in the cafeteria which was loud and very difficulty to hear or speak in, she didn't ask much as if she already had her mind made up. The next day I was sent a rejection letter without a reason. The good thing is I didn't get set-up with their unsafe ratios. They are trying to push nurses to have 8 patients on med-surg!! There definitely needs to be federal law instituting mandated nurse-patient ratios. Med-surg needs to change to no more than 4-5.
