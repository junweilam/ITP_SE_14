I happily agreed and applied. Subsequently, I had 2 separate interviews and a week or so after the last interview I received an email stating the following: \"The hiring team has decided to pursue other candidates who they believe will meet the needs of the department and organization at this time. We wish you all the best in your job search and future professional endeavors.\"\n\nWhile I'm perfectly okay that they decided to move on with another candidate (I had received an offer elsewhere the same week), I am disappointed by the lack of communication about the process and generic copy/paste email I received from the HR team. There was no consideration for the haste with which I was expected to make myself available for another position and no acknowledgement that I had been pulled out of the running for the original position I applied for. \n\nNote to NQF as an org and HR specifically - please be more mindful to the bridges you could be burning with potential talent in the future, especially as a company who is this severely understaffed.

The recruiter was very unprofessional and left a very bad impression of the company after finishing up the interview. I was contacted by the recruiter via email to schedule a time to have a brief screening call. During the screening call, she proceeded to tell me she was a very slow typist but she had to write my answers down word for word. I had to pause after every single word to give her time to type. I ended up losing track of what I was saying because she would interrupt me saying I was talking too fast even though I was substantially slowing down my speech and ended up pausing for about 7 seconds per word! Even with simple questions like \"why do you want to work here\" - when I answered initially with \"I want to work here because...\", she would pause me right there so that should could write down what I just said. Often times, asking me to repeat things numerous times and pause after each word. Needless to say, during the 30 minute interview, I answered maybe 5 questions because the recruiter needed me to repeat things numerous times and also needed me to pause after every...single....word. \r\n\r\nShe then ended the interview telling me to reach out to her in two weeks. Normally, it is the recruiters job to reach out to you. Instead, she clarified that it was my responsibility to follow up. Really disappointed because I felt I wasted my time preparing and if I had a more competent recruiter, I felt I could answer the questions more comprehensively. However, I felt I had to keep my answers brief and within 5-6 words because the recruiter couldn't type the answers quick enough.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work here?

I did proceed and have the phone interview with the hiring manager, but did not hear anything following that. I reached out to HR to determine if I was still being considered and they did not even bother to respond.
