I open with that because while the process was many steps and over many weeks every aptitude test and interview type was value added. I learned more about the behind the scenes and the employer than I had expected and they learned a lot about me. A significant and important difference with how Life.Church stands out is that my spouse was invited to several stages or phases of the interview process. The appreciation and understanding of how we work together in life to succeed was deeply felt and appreciated. Be prepared to know yourself well and to be provided with many challenges and resources to tackle those challenges throughout the process. From recruiting & talent acquisition to hiring managers and panel interviews the process was engagement but for me the most pleasant and meaningful for me to date in 15 years of professional work history. 20 years if you count jobs that helped me through college. Now with all this testing a lot of coordinating with schedules and staging out different phases was handled excellently and is subject to continuous improvement. So your process may be different than mine but you can expect to work with genuinely curious and professionally dedicated people with a high caliber of skills you could expect to see in any STEM / growth talent industry. Another significant and noteworthy stage was a central campus tour. You can tell people are comfortable working here and the intentionality is easily seen in the layout and setup or design of the office space.

The second interview involved one very simple technical question and, overall, I thought it went well but I did find it a bit odd that the interviewers used that one question to gauge my technical knowledge.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after my video interview, I received another e-mail inviting my wife and me to fly out for an in-person interview.  This \"interview event,\" as they called it, included a full weekend experience and we were told up-front that there would be other candidates there as well. Turns out, the other candidates were all there to interview for different roles.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived to pick up our rental car (all paid for by the church) we found it a bit odd that the person at the rental agency asked us if we were interviewing with Life.Church and, when we said yes, she advised us to \"be careful how we interact with people because they're watching you.\" We thought, surely that can't be the case. Who would do that? That was the first red flag that we ignored.\r\n\r\nOur first night there, we attended services at the OKC campus. A couple more red flags, that we initially ignored, began to surface. They don't call their worship centers anything of the sort. They are referred to as \"studios\" and we were left with the strong impression that this was more of a production company than a church...again, we ignored this at first because they put up a good front.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, we toured a number of their local facilities and attended multiple worship services in the process. Another red flag appeared when, in the middle of worship, videos of the senior pastor, Craig Groeschel, began to play. It felt very much like the congregation was worshipping Craig and not God.\r\n\r\nDuring the tours of the \"central offices,\" we also noticed that there were a number of quotes and phrases written all over the walls. As a church, you would expect these to be scripture. They were not. They were all things that Craig himself has said, not one word from God on their walls. Again, in our excitement, we initially ignored what is a huge red flag for a church.\r\n\r\nDay three is when the actual interview took place. This began with all of the candidates and their spouses in a single room, moving from one table to the next in a \"round robin\" style interview. Each candidate had 6 minutes to answer 6 questions at each table. I did find this concept somewhat interesting.\r\n\r\nAfter the \"round robins\" we were all taken into a conference room and then separated for the \"second round\" into different rooms. In our \"second round\" the first thing that was said to us was that they didn't feel I was being genuine in my answers and that they felt I had rehearsed my answers. Which as interesting since I had no way of knowing what they were going to ask me, so how could I rehearse for this? My wife and I both, rather desperately, tried to explain to them that this is simply my personality and that I was being 100% genuine in my responses.\r\n\r\nThe \"third round\" wasn't an interview at all. They asked us what we thought of their church. We were on the spot, so we gave them a glowing review (which we now regret.) Once they got what they were looking for there, they rather abruptly told me that they were not going to be moving forward because I don't have the amount of experience they were looking for.\r\n\r\nRead that again: My resume explicitly states that I am a fresh graduate with no industry experience. This fact was discussed in great detail in both of my previous interviews. Why would they fly us all the way out for a \"final interview\" if my lack of experience was an issue for them? There was no way they weren't already aware of this.\r\n\r\nI was in complete shock and had no idea how to respond. My wife began to cry because of the realization that they had wasted two months of our time and took us away from our children for the weekend for absolutely no reason hit her very abruptly. The moment she started to cry, they kicked us out of the building. This was at noon. Our flight home as at 6 pm.\r\n\r\nSo we suddenly found ourselves in a city hundreds of miles from home, with nowhere to go for six hours while we waited for our return flight. While we were at the airport, they called us. Not to check on us or make sure we were okay or even to apologize; but to inform us that the reimbursement check for our flights was ready and we needed to pick it up at the front desk...at the building, we just got kicked out of.\r\n\r\nAs we were sitting in the airport waiting for our flight, the other candidates began to arrive over time.

It's worth noting this whole process can take weeks.\r\n\r\nFirst, the testing is IQ/spatial awareness/intelligence stuff followed by psuedo-science Myers Briggs testing. The effectiveness of these is highly debated and most scientific studies about them have revealed bias, so it's surprising a church would continue to use them. \"It's the only thing that's consistent\" they say, but so was not hiring POC back in the day, so I feel like times can change and there's just refusal to do so.\r\n\"We only use them for information, not qualification\" they said before I took it, but the hiring folks beat me over the head with the results of it, so I feel a bit like they were kidding themselves on this. I outscored their \"average\" employee score in every area but one, they picked that one out to ask why I wasn't good at it. That worried me as foreshadowing culture here (focus on the negative instead of your strengths). Just because they've used bad tools for so long is what they're continuing to do so. Tradition! From a claimed non-traditional workplace. For a perspective employee, these are large red flags.\r\n\r\nSecond, the interview weekend is on their expense, but it is a significant time investment, so just be forewarned. You'll attend and do tours on the weekend, and then on Monday you'll do several rounds of interviews with other folks. Your spouse (if you have one) is expected to attend, too.

The Interview weekend is with all of the candidates and their spouses. \nOn Saturday, you attend the broadcast campus to see Pastor Craig live, and then go out to dinner.\nSunday begins early and you visit about 3 different OKC Metro churches.\nAt any point, they might ask you to be done, however this didn\u2019t happen for any of us on Sat/Sun.\n\nOn Monday, you go through the gauntlet of interviews of several group-style interviews, and they send all the candidates back into a conference room to wait while they talk about you, and then you do another one: rinse and repeat. The group interviews are full of people from both your team (usually leader-level) as well as other teams.\nLife.Church is high feedback, and this entire process is designed to see how you react to that and let them know about you as a person. You cannot fake your way through it. Don\u2019t even try: if you aren\u2019t on board with the Life.Church vision and mission, they\u2019ll find out and you won\u2019t make it.\n\nThe entire weekend (even touring the campuses) is an interview.

The weekend in Oklahoma City begins with attending the main campus on Saturday night and then a follow up get-together.

Then, if you make it to the Monday morning interviews, that\u2019s where you go in for testing and afterwards the interview process begins again. You are sitting in the lobby and they come out and select you to go back and be interviewed by two people in an office. That goes on for about 10 minutes and then you go back into the lobby and hope your name is called for the next round. This repeats two or three more times. If you make it through all of those rounds like I did, then you are taken into the Conference room where you are told to choose number 1, 2, or 3. After you have chosen a number they give you a topic that you have to construct a sermon off of without using your phone. Some of the topics included plastic surgery and masturbation. After the 10 minutes is over for your preparation you are taken into what they call, Studio B, where their guest speakers preach from. You go on stage and preach in front of a crowd of people. It\u2019s very intimidating. But I did feel like I grew as a leader through this entire process.
