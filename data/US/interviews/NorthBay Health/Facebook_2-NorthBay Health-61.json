They smiled and greeted me.  I brought my resume it was four pages long.  Later, I found out from colleagues and friends to give a one page resume.  Front to back if needed but one page looks better.    The hospital was clean and there were several people waiting for their turn.  I was nervous a bit but once I started talking I felt at ease.  But it was shocking to see so many people and watching your give your answers.  The group made me uneasy.  I felt like I had to perform a show or entertain them with my lame answers.  After the interview and I was driving home, I replayed the scenario and I basically bombed the interview.  I was so embarrassed.
