The final message that day was that the interview would be the next day Tuesday and that she \"expected\" to hear back from me by 4pm that day (msg left at 3:15, with no indication of time, only that it would be in Admin bldg).\n\nI currently am employed and live 5 hours away. \n\nNext day I do not hear back, so I call HR. HR states that typically for that level of position, they allow candidate to arrange for travel a few days out (incl reimbursement for out of town travel). HR rep contacts hiring manager, and reports back that the person who previously left messages would contact me to schedule interview next week to allow for travel. This occurred, but she didn't  seem to know what she was doing (could not even tell me whom I'd be meeting with).\n\nThe interview was panel style, engaging and relevant to posted position, great behaviorally based interview questions. I traveled, rented room, took day off to interview (no indication there would be 2nd round).\n\nI was contacted again, woman left a msg with details for 2nd interview, I called back and left a msg, accepting time/date and I asked about process and whom I'd be interviewing with. She sent email confirming meeting, but did not answer one question about accommodations or type of interview.\n\n2nd: It wa VP of program area and other leadership rep.  There was no real structure, no real questions... it was as if they already knew what I found out 2 weeks later when I called to follow up with VP.\n\nThey pulled the position and rewrote it, I'd have to reapply, but she encouraged me to reapply and would be sure to reimburse travel for revised position (could not for previous pos).\n\nNo thank you. Ethically, that was wrong.  The panel interview was great, seem like they'd be great colleagues. Interview w/leadership seemed dismissive and did not care about how their decisions impacted those they lead.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about a time you had to manage multiple priorities.\n\nHow do you deal with swift changes in administration and  direction?"}, {"date": "30 Jan 2020", "title": "Dean Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Florida State College at Jacksonville in Dec 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "Had a recent interview for Dean position.

Job interviews are nerve wracking as it is, but to be asked a 3 part question like it's a Miss America pageant?  It's too much.   Not even sure if I answered all the parts.
