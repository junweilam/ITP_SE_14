In other words, they wanted a lab drone - no more than that. Their 3rd shift had no dedicated blood bankers so it would fall on 2nd shift to complete most of the work regardless of how late it became. In a level  trauma center it's ridiculous to NOT have dedicated bankers on all shifts - period. Lab tour was last and on seeing it, could understand WHY the blood bank crew looked tired and seemed ornery - it was the worst designed lab  ever  - anywhere, regardless of facility size in my almost 30 years of employment around the country. I couldn't imagine working there and suddenly felt sorry for the crew. The facility itself was posh and very patient/family oriented (read: lots of $$). My accommodations were posh as well. Was reimbursed handsomely for travel. But it was clear that little or no $$ had been relegated to the labs - and that the new hire would be a slave.
