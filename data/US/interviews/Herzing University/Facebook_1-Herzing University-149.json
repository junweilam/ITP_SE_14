She asked me about my background, why I wanted this role, why I had a gap on my resume, etc. She opened with \"we can't pay you you're requested salary, are you willing to negotiate?\". Then she went over the role. First red flag: The role was marketed as full time remote, but it was clear that they wanted someone in person. She asked me if I had worked remotely before, and basically said this would be the first time they opened up positions to be fully remote. She tells me, however, there was recently a meeting with their execs and they discussed whether they could even have remote staff. However, she wanted to move forward with me for the second panel interview. So she lied to me twice, and basically called to waste my time. She knew that the position wouldn't be remote, and that I obviously wouldn't be contacted for a second interview. All of this after she boasted transparency. Second red flag: After I stated that I wanted to work for a company where I could grow professional, she kept probing and asking what I meant by \"growth\". That, to me, meant there were no growth opportunities. Especially after she said their financial aid advisors \"do it all\". So you expect me to do it all for the bare min salary? That's the third red flag. I am not sure what she wished to gain from our meeting, but it was clear to me that I would never hear from her again even after she assured me that I'd hear back within 3 days. So as a warning to future interviewers: clarify salary and remote work options PRIOR to the interview.", "Interview Questions": "What do you mean by growth? Why do you want to work here?

Took about two weeks in total.  I really liked the staff, but turned down the offer because  1) they were very numbers focused without being willing to tell me what goals I would have to be able to know if I'm doing my job well, and 2) the school used to be for-profit and I read a lot of student and staff reviews that alluded that the school hadn't really changed its ways.  This was confirmed by the interviewer saying that they give financial aid where other schools wouldn't.

The phone interview was only 30 minutes.  The on campus was one hour.  I arrived for the campus interview about 10 minutes early and awkwardly had to observe the interviewer conversing with the another candidate whom he had just finished interviewing and was walking out.
