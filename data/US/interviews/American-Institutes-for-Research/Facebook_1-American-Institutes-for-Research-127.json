While the salary is certainly competitive for an entry-level position, salary negotiation was not at all welcome. It was actually a little awkward how taken aback the HR person was when I attempted to negotiate. I assumed that salary negotiation was expected; even though they were unable to negotiate, they could have been more polite/understanding in refusing the negotiation. I say this because salary negotiation, while a difficult skill, is important particularly when it comes to pay equity and I believe it is a practice that should be much more openly discussed.

About two weeks after I submitted the assessment, the recruiter reached out to schedule an in-person interview with the entire team at the headquarter in DC. The half-day interview took about 3 hours, with half-hour time slots with different team members, from senior level to associate level. \r\n\r\nI would say that the phone interview and the coding assessment were definitely okay overall, but the in-person interview was a bit confusing and also very stressful, because of the various different (even conflicting) expectations from different members of the team about this position. I was asked a lot of technical questions for which one of the interviewers was expecting a certain fixed answer, and the in-person interview was actually different than I had imagined. I was also asked questions about experience and qualifications that were not included in the job description, and it seems that the interviewers did not quite get on the same page about what to expect about this role.

After those interviews, I interviewed in person two days later: 4, 30-minute interviews back to back and a writing test. After that the hiring manager wanted to do another 30 min phone interview the following week. The hiring manager made me a verbal offer in the last phone meeting, discussed my salary expectations which were on target with hers, discussed a starting date and that they wanted to switch the role to a contract position for the first 3 months, to which I agreed. She told me she'd have the HR personnel follow up with me and that she was excited to have me come aboard. I waited a week for HR to contact and then followed up. The HR person indicated that the hiring manager had not contacted her with offer information for me and that the hiring manager still wanted to interview other candidates and would make a decision and notify me on a specific date in a week. A week later the HR person told me I was still under consideration but they would be pushing their decision back by another week. That week came and went and I was not notified either way. \r\n\r\nIn all, aside from my meetings with HR and the four individuals, the interview process was disorganized. Each thirty minute interview was rushed and didn't offer enough time to have reasonable discussions, but each person I met with still tried to have a good interview meeting despite the rush. Also the hiring manager was rushed in all three of the meetings I had with her and obviously it left a bad taste to be offered the job by the hiring manager and then to not even be directly told that the offer is being rescinded or rethought or why. She asked me to prepare some materials for the interview, which I did and then apparently did not remember what materials she had asked for also didn't have time to look at them. \r\n\r\nThe hiring managers at this firm need additional training from HR on how to conduct interviews well: how long a quality interview should be, how to prepare yourself and questions prior to an interview in order to gather the data you need to make a decision in an organized and timely manner and of course what questions you can legally ask candidates so as not to open the company up to any legal exposure. No one took notes in any of minutes and essentially just asked me questions off the cuff.\r\n\r\nI've known other employers who work from a list of set questions when interviewing multiple candidates to ensure equitable comparison, to ensure of course notes are taken rather than working from memory to make a hiring decision and to ensure they don't discuss things they shouldn't with candidates.\r\n\r\nAlso be considerate of the effort candidates put into in their job search and make sure that hiring managers have the time to evaluate candidates, their work and respond in a reasonable timeframe or certainly in the time frame you commit to respond in.", "Interview Questions": "General interview questions about my professional background and interest in the role and the company.

I was confused to why this happened and reach out to the HR person and found out that she had left AIR. I reached out to the PhD Researcher who only told me that everything over in the HR side is confidential, and even though I followed up with another HR person, I never heard back.

The interview process started with a phone screening, where I was told about the company, what the position entailed, and asked about my expectations (what I wanted, salary, etc.).  Very very basic stuff just to make sure I was interested.  \r\n\r\nAfter the phone screening, I was invited for an in-person interview at the office in D.C.  I met with NINE people.  First, the HR rep that I had spoken with on the phone, then I was shuffled from office to office to meet almost everyone on the team that held the same or similar job role as I was interviewing for.  It was really unorganized. These people were NOT trained interviewers.  They were literally just told that I was coming in and given a list of generic interview questions (i.e. What is your greatest strength? Weakness?) to ask me.  They were really cool, and I enjoyed talking to them, but they were definitely uncomfortable \"interviewing\" me.  It struck me as really odd.  Especially, when I asked them how conflicts were managed in the workplace and they responded with, \"Oh, we don't really have conflicts here...\"  Come on.  There is ALWAYS some amount of conflict.  But the layout of the office was pretty sequestered (two to an office room), so it seems like they have very little interaction with each other.  And most communication seems to be through email.  So, perhaps they do have little conflict.  \r\n\r\nAfter meeting a whole string of people, I met with the final HR liaison who went over salary and benefits, like parking.  The starting salary was REALLY low, $38,000.  I asked for higher, and I have a year's worth of experience in education.  I asked when I would be hearing about a decision, and was told that I should know by the end of the following week.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks went by and I heard nothing.  So, I emailed my HR rep from the very beginning.  He said that they had to schedule two interviews for the following week, so I should know the week following.  I waited some more... Waited two weeks after the second deadline and heard NOTHING.  Now, it's MONTHS after my interview and I've just GIVEN UP.  It is SO INCREDIBLY RUDE for them to just ignore me after all the effort I went through during the interview process.  DO NOT WORK HERE. THE PAY IS LOW AND THEY TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP DURING THE INTERVIEW PROCESS.  NO WONDER THEY DON'T HAVE CONFLICT MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THEY AVOID CONFLICT LIKE THE PLAGUE.  A simple, \"I'm sorry but we've decided to hire someone else\" would have been nice.

I heard back about a week and a half later over the phone. I was a little caught off guard because I hadn't received an email in advance letting me know I was being considered and I was attending a class at the time. When I had returned the call, it turned out to be a very basic, preliminary HR screen; I was asked why I had applied and what interested me about the company. Shortly afterwards, I received an email asking me to schedule phone interviews. \r\n\r\nI went through one round of phone interviews with two staff members. The people interviewing me were from two different offices - one was someone in a position similar to mine and the other was a senior researcher who had been at the company for quite some time. Both experiences were positive and questions were pretty straightforward (prior work experience, ability to work in groups, interest in the company and projects). Although from speaking with the staff member who was in a similar position as the one I was interviewing in,  it was made very apparent that it is difficult to move up in the company without a higher degree (she was leaving for graduate school shortly thereafter). \r\n\r\nI received another call several business days later (again, during class) letting me know that the phone interviewers had responded positively and they were going to move ahead with scheduling in-person interviews. The in-person interview lasted about 3.5 hours. Again, interviews were conducted in rounds. I spoke with HR, research assistants, research associates, senior researchers, and then looped back with HR. Everyone was pleasant and questions again were pretty standard - nothing too tricky, just basics on education, elaborating on prior relevant work, work attitude and style, etc. I was told that they would be in contact.\r\n\r\nHere's where it gets tricky. If you are applying for other jobs, HR tends to get a little bit more irritable. Firstly, be honest about where else you are applying and whether or not you are already considering their offer. For me, I had been juggling other offers and HR was not as responsive as they had initially promised. I was told there would be a response within the week, and a week later, when I touched back in with HR, I was told they were just starting to consider all applicants. I essentially had to force their hand and told them I needed an answer right away since I had already been holding off on other offers - I got the sense that HR was flustered, but in my mind, if I was a good fit, they should have stopped interviewing others indefinitely and gotten back to me when they had promised.", "Interview Questions": "All questions were very straightforward - some were even questions that were asked in previous rounds of interviews.

After a customary meeting with the HR person, I had a phone interview with someone at the same job level (which went swimmingly) and then  a face to face with a senior administrator (which went even more swimmingly). Next was my presentation and things suddenly went  irrevocably south. Attending the presentation was a mix of junior and senior researchers, including the two I met during the initial phone interview. The senior researcher seemed confused but not hostile to my presentation, the hiring manager heckled. The presentation did not win rave reviews from anyone, but no one else heckled. I explained myself as well as I could, but it did not make a dent. Next was my lunch. With the aforementioned hiring manager. \r\n\r\nI started trying to get a hold of the process, because the interview was slipping out of my fingers. Although it was clear as daylight that she had made up her mind about me, I was trying to stay positive while trying to answer her increasingly impatient questions. At some point, she asked me how I would change the centuries of gender bias in my country (my work and education are a million miles away from this question) I gave up and said, I don't know. She stopped me and started giving me 'feedback', the gist of which was that I'd sucked at the interview in every way. My answers weren't impressive enough, my ideas weren't grand enough (she said she didn't care in the least if any of them were truthful) and I hadn't shown myself to be good enough. About an eternity of this surreal plot twist later, we continued with the 'interviewee's questions' part of the meeting (I was offered the consolation prize for asking 'good' questions). Then on to two more interviews, normal and professional as can be. The second one ended with the kicker- \"you should've presented your other work\" (instead of the one vetted by the recruiter and the senior researcher). Bazinga! \r\n\r\nNever heard from them again, but I knew the answer by noon.", "Interview Questions": "How will you change centuries of gender bias in your country?"}, {"date": "10 Nov 2012", "title": "Project Specialist Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at American Institutes for Research", "Interview Descriptions": "First, I interviewed with an HR representative and then had two phone interviews within a few days of the initial HR interview.

I applied for a job through the online system, but also had a mentor forward my CV to several hiring managers in the organization.  Within 24 hours of my CV being sent to contacts in AIR, a recruiter called me to set up an initial phone screen for the next day.  The scheduled interview time came and went with no call.  The next day, the same recruiter contacted me again to set up a phone screen.  When I explained that I'd had an phone interview scheduled, but no one called me at the designated time, the recruiter said that she \"couldn't remember\" if she'd set up an interview with me and that she must have missed it on her calendar.  The phone screen was rescheduled for the next day and actually happened this time.  The interview lasted about 30-45 minutes and went very well.  The recruiter contacted me the next business day to set up a phone interview with 2 hiring managers.  She also asked me to send a writing sample and sent an email to confirm the scheduled interview time.  However, like the initial phone screen, the scheduled interview time with the hiring managers came and went with no phone call.  I contacted the recruiter to find out what had happened, and she said that the hiring managers \"got really busy and forgot to call\" me.  Once again, the interview was rescheduled.  This time, only one of the hiring managers called, but the interview went on as planned.  It went very well, and I was told that they were interested in bringing me in for an on-site interview once they were certain that they would have enough funding to hire another researcher.  Almost two months have passed, and I still have not been contacted to schedule the on-site interview.  While it is possible that they are still trying to work out the funding situation, I've basically given up on AIR and do not intend to continue the interview process with them if I am contacted.  I'm just amazed that an organization of this stature thinks that they can continue to get the \"best and brightest\" to work for them when the hiring process is such a mess.  I got along well with the hiring manager who interviewed me, and I think I would have enjoyed working for him, but just about everything else in the interview process suggested huge problems with the organizational culture at AIR.", "Interview Questions": "No difficult or unexpected questions.
