Did well on phone interview (according to the woman I spoke with) but then had to take some test on the computer (from home). Was expecting a typing test, but instead it was some sort of personality test. Not one of the scenarios in that test related in anyway to the job that I was applying for. After the test, I received an email saying that I was not a candidate. I think an in person interview would be a much better judge of wether or not someone should be considered.
