The following timeline is simply a matter of fact.\r\n\r\n1.) I received a  general email  from a person within the recruiting department on a Thursday  morning asking me for my availability. \r\n\r\n2.) I responded to that Thursday morning email within one hour, and offered my availability for that same day (Thursday) and the next day (Friday). Additionally, I offered to give more slots for the next week, if he needed time for next week. I did not get a response back. This did not bother me - people get busy.\r\n\r\n3.) The next day, Friday, I got a morning email, letting me know (just in general) that he was planning to call me that day, despite him asking for, and me replying with, actual time slots.  \r\n\r\nOK- so I again shrugged this off, giving the hiring team the benefit of the doubt (again), since I am aware people just get super busy and things happen. \r\n\r\n4.) Thus, I ended up waiting practically the entire day....even going as far as informing people in my meetings that I may need to abruptly get off since \"I could be getting an important call at any time\". I never got a call. Although. I was very bothered by this, I again give the benefit of the doubt. I have recruited people before and I haver forgotten to call people back before. \r\n\r\n5.) On Sunday, March 20, having heard nothing back thus far, I sent another follow up email, offering time slots for both Monday March 21 and Tuesday March 22.\r\n\r\n6.) I received no correspondence Monday March 21. I told myself that I think I needed to submit feedback if I don't hear back by COB March 22.\r\n\r\n7.) It's now March 22 COB and I still have not heard back. True to my word I decided to submit this feedback.\r\n\r\n8.) I only decided to write this review after Step 6. I am really disappointed about the whole situation and hope that they take my feedback and work to improve their hiring process so that other candidates do not have to go through what I went through.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "8 Jun 2020", "title": "Nephrology Social Worker Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Satellite Healthcare (Los Angeles, CA) in May 2020", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview was brief.
