Written test was 5 hours long and was sent to me one hour in advance than agreed. Also, the recruiter didn't say anything in advance about the duration of the written test. Once I completed the second interview (which was supposed to be the last), the recruiter told me that I Will have to do another one, he schedule the date one day After and gave no other options saying that the interviewer Will only be available at that date and then Will go on vacation. Once I said I Will not be available at that time, the recruiter disappeared and contacted me again after a while. They disclosed their salary only at the very end of the process, when they told me I was selected; I had to ask them two times in a row about it. Time duration of the process: preliminary interview -30 minutes; written technical test -5 hours; technical interview -1 hour; technical interview -1 hour. Total time: 7 hours 30 minutes, which Is really a lot! In general, the recruitment process was too long, very shady, lacked many informations and was very one-sided. These were too big red flags for me and I declined their offer. I would really suggest to avoid this organization: potential employees deserve respect and should not be available 24h on 24h at their own   will.

Not good, which was sad because this was, I thought, my dream job. I applied in April... finally heard back 1 month later to schedule an interview with a recruiter, which was fairly generic hiring questions. It took nearly another month to hear back after that, which was just to say they weren't ready to schedule second interviews because too many people were on vacation. FINALLY had the second interview scheduled in June, two months after the first interview, with a few members of the HR staff, and it was more HR specific questions this time. I thought the interview went really well. At the end, they let me know they were at the very beginning of the process of second interviews so it would be a while before I heard anything... and I was patient. So patient that two entire months went by without a word, until I finally reached out to the recruiter myself to request a status update and found out I just didn't get it and got a \"oh whoops thought we contacted you already!\" It's 2022 and email is free, if people can take leave from their current positions and give you 1-2 hours of their time for multiple interviews, it seems like you can at least show them the respect of sending a timely rejection letter.", "Interview Questions": "How do you think this position aligns with the values of Search for Common Ground?"}, {"date": "23 Sept 2022", "title": "MEAL Officer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 week.\u00a0I interviewed at Search for Common Ground (\u1e28aww\u0101rah, Amman Governorate) in Mar 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview was for 45 minutes, an HR employee, line manager and director.
