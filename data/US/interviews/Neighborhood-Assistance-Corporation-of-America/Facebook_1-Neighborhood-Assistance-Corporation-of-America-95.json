They have these online job fairs quite often. The application process is an essay that takes hours to complete. I received an email a few days later stating I had been invited to do an online interview via zoom. Two days prior to the interview I received another link to take an assessment during working hours that was also live on Zoom. The interview took 3 hours. Most of that was spent waiting for someone to do the interview. The person I interviewed with did not even have my resume nor did he had any questions that could have been used to assess my skills. After speaking with me for about 5 minutes he was going to send me to a manager for a second interview. The manager was not available and I was supposed to be scheduled at a later date. Two weeks later I get an email on a Sunday night indicating that they had moved on with another candidate.
