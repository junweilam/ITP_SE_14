Was interviewed by 7 people, like do these people not really have anything to do! I've interviewed at amazon and for police departments and this was the toughest interview I've ever been in, for frankly a job that wasn't really that great. The CIO was actually a bit condescending, I got the impression that it may have been a somewhat tense work environment. Most of the questions were skill based, I have some skills that matched the description, but it became obvious that they were actually looking for a CCNA, which you can hire for a much lower wage than what they were advertising.  I was asked to fill out a skills survey, again a first for me ever, I've heard of skills testing but generally hiring managers and HR reps can get a good feel of your background with a skills test or a resume. The CIO seemed a bit obsessed with this survey that didn't really seem relevant to the position.  HR reps were completely professional and very accommodating.", "Interview Questions": "If you are selected, when can you start?
