Approximately 3 months after I completed the online application I received an email from an interview coordinator who turned out to be a part time assistant for the hiring manager (a VP level). I was asked for my availability to come in for a committee interview and was given a list of 8-10 names who would be at that interview. When I asked if I needed to prepare anything, I was told no. Even though only 4 people from the list actually attended, this committee interview was somewhat stressful because I am not used to this interview format. At least everyone was professional, polite, and asked informed questions. I had no idea how I 'did' at the interview and did not hear any feedback nor receive any responses from my thank you emails.\r\n\r\nI did not hear anything for about 2 more months when I got another email from the interview coordinator congratulating me for being a finalist for the role and asking my availability for another committee interview. This time I was sent a list of about 8 very high level people who would attend. Again, I was told that I did not need to prepare anything. All 8 people on this list attended this interview  -- and it was extremely stressful as there was one person on the committee who outranked all of the others. I felt that this individual guided most of the questioning and tone of the meeting and perhaps the other people in the room did not feel free to speak.  Again, after the meeting I had no idea how it 'went' and never received any feedback.\r\n\r\nOne high level person claimed to not be available at the time of that second group meeting and requested a 1:1 interview. From the moment this person greeted me in his office I could tell there was a 'problem.' First, he seemed quite angry to see me -- I'm not sure why, as I had never met this person before--and he was extremely hostile the entire time we met (30 minutes). He proceeded to badger me with a negative and skeptical tone about my credentials and was quite demeaning--even picking up my resume at one point and dismissively throwing it back down on his desk. At one point he flat out said 'I have no idea why I am meeting you as a finalist for this role' then asked me 'how I got to be a finalist.'\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what this person's issue was, but I found it completely unprofessional, regardless of the industry. After all, if he had such a problem with my candidacy, he could have just provided that feedback without torturing me with a 30 minute in person meeting.  The interaction with him felt sadistic and I felt bullied.\r\n\r\nThere were people I interacted with in the process who were lovely to deal with, but overall I now find myself turned off by my first interview experience in academia and question the culture at this particular institution. I believe that if you aren't treated well in the interview process, when everyone should be trying to put their best foot forward, it might be a sign of a toxic environment.", "Interview Questions": "Are you familiar with marketing automation systems?
