The application process was long and required a lot of work in document preparation but it made sense. For example, you are asked to provide a document which outlines your teaching philosophy, which made me think that the selection panel would use this to ensure a good match between the candidate's approach and the Business School's approach. The actual interview process was almost a whole day. It began with lunch with key faculty. I liked this because it felt less formal, less stressful. However, I did have lots of questions fired at me during the meal!  What became clear to me during lunch was that my new colleagues had a very similar view of education to me and I was impressed by the Dept. Chair's sense of humor. I got the impression that I would be very happy working with these people. The lunch was followed with a number of short interviews with key faculty, including the Dean. I then had a short break before I had to teach a class. This was the most stressful part of the process. I had been given plenty of notice and support to be able to prepare effectively but it is still stressful to be observed in action. After my session I was thanked by the faculty and one member then explained what would happen next. Overall, I felt that the whole process was highly professional and that all the activities were appropriate for selecting a good candidate. At the end of the day I felt that I'd done a good job and was hopeful. It felt like a fair and well balanced process and I was confident that if I was not selected that there had genuinely been someone who was a better fit or performed better than me.", "Interview Questions": "It was a technical question on my position on the use of personality inventories for leadership selection and development.
