At the conclusion of the phone interview, the recruiter told me I was by far the top candidate and would be required to contact five references for screening. I connected with all five references and they completed the online process which included 28 rating questions and 2 essays. I then followed up with the recruiter a number of times over 2 and half months at which point an in person interview was scheduled. Last week I attended the in person interview and a week later was informed they are proceeding with another candidate. This process has taken a total of 12 weeks. In addition it has burned my references and wasted their time. I think it\u2019s very unfair to require references from applicants when you\u2019re not seriously considering them.
