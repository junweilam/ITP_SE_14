I initially received a form rejection when I applied. Then I received a request for a phone interview. I confirmed with the hiring manager that they wanted to interview me. The hiring manager was very apologetic about the error, even calling me to apologize and express that they were very interested in interviewing me. The phone interview went well, they seemed enthusiastic about my skills, and the hiring manager outlined clearly what the next steps may be and when I could expect to hear from them next. I was then invited for a second and final interview on the day the hiring manager said they'd get back to me. Up until this point, I was quite impressed with how they were handling the candidate experience and I was hopeful and excited about the opportunity. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I felt my experience went downhill during the final in-person interview - which was with two folks from the team. One of the interviewers was late and while we were waiting for this person, I was told they had 14 questions to get through and I'd be doing myself a disservice if I spent too long answering them and they couldn't get to them all. This didn't sit right with me. After all, I'd shown up to the interview on time. \r\n\r\nBoth interviewers were polite and professional in demeanor. I was able to ask a couple questions of my own before I was abruptly told we were out of time. I was told I could call or send them an email with any further questions I had. They said they'd get back to me with their decision the next week, which seemed like a very fast timeline. I sent the hiring manager a thank you letter with the rest of my questions and I have yet to receive any kind of response. \r\n\r\nGiven the hiring manager had been super responsive and concerned about my experience up until the in-person interview, this was surprising.  I showed up on time, came in professionally dressed, and answered their questions thoughtfully - respecting that they needed to get through them all, even though it was not my fault we were short on time. I would have appreciated a simple \"thank you, but we're going in a different direction\" response. It would have taken 60 seconds to write. Ultimately, I decided the role wasn't for me - I had been on the fence about a particular aspect of the role, but how I was treated when we met in person left a negative impression. Even when you are no longer interested in a candidate, it\u2019s important to treat them with the same respect you did at the start of the process.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it "}, {"date": "28 Sept 2017", "title": "Intern Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Diversus Health (Colorado Springs, CO) in May 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "Thorough interview that allowed me to ask questions as well.
