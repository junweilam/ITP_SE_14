[Positive experience]\r\n\r\nStage 2: Delivered a 25 minute teaching demonstration to 40-45 students in a campus classroom.  The committee assigned the topic in advance.  [Positive experience]\r\n\r\nStage 3: Met with two faculty members from the original search committee and an administrator via Skype (30-45 minutes).  [Negative experience]\r\n\r\nNote: You had to be advanced from one stage to the next.\r\n\r\nHere's what bothered me about interviewing at Mt. SAC:\r\n\r\n1. I don't think the administrator conducted herself in a professional manner during the third stage.  Instead of exploring my qualifications, she asked some tangential questions that came off like she wanted to find something wrong with me instead of getting to know me.  Next, when I spoke about relevant work experiences  that I believe the college would benefit from (e.g. course development), she appeared rather disinterested (e.g. looking away from the screen).\r\n\r\n2. Human Resources contacted my current supervisor before they decided who they wanted to offer the position to (note: this happened between stages two and three).  Needless to say, this created an awkward situation for me at the school where I currently teach.\r\n\r\n3. When Human Resources initially called me, they never mentioned that I would have to visit the campus twice.  Luckily, they made other arrangements to use Skype for the third stage (which I totally appreciated), but I had to inquire multiple times to confirm this would happen.  Also, I communicated with at least four different people in HR and I don't know how well they communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nTakeaway:\r\n\r\nI clicked with the search committee and my teaching demonstration went over well with the students, but I sense that the administrator made the final decision.  What's odd about this is that she never saw me teach a lesson.  You'd think that someone who's so concerned about students would want to see you in action.  Overall, I had a good experience with most of the people I encountered at Mt. SAC.  That said, I can't say I would apply if they have another opening because the leadership left me with a bad feeling about the whole process.", "Interview Questions": "Samples:\r\n-What about your education and experience prepares you for the position?\r\n-How do you stay current in your field?\r\n-What kinds of themes are important in the classes you teach?"}], [{"date": "18 Oct 2017", "title": "Office Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Mt.
