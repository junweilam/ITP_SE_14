This lasted approximately 30 minutes. I was asked about my previous work experience, and how much time I spent on the phone on a given day in my last position. After the phone interview, I was contacted to set up an in-person interview. I interviewed with the Assistant Director of Enrollment Services. The interview questions were fairly typical, asking about my previous experience and how situations in those positions would help me in the Enrollment Counselor position. The interviewer read from a sheet of questions but she still did well in making me feel comfortable and like the situation wasn't overly formal. I received a lot of information about the position. In this role, you are expected to log 60 phone calls and 2 hours of talk time on the phone daily. Every few weeks you would have a meeting with your supervisor to go over a call of yours that was recorded and discuss ways to improve it, which made me feel like this position was more of a telemarketer than anything. It also made me uncomfortable that essentially you were being watched and recorded on the phone. Additionally, your hours throughout the week are 8-5 for 3 days, and 2 days you have to work from 11am-8pm. This interview took place on the \"garden level\" that the office was on. This \"garden level\" referred to a basement level of the building - no garden, and no windows. The office was dimly lit and very gray. After this interview, I was contacted shortly after to schedule a second, final interview with the Director of Enrollment Services. This interview asked several of the same questions and seemed to hone in on a few specifically. Throughout both interviews, there was a lot of focus on phone calls and this company quota that had to be met. Many questions involved asking how I would ensure I was just as positive and helpful from the first call to number 80. No matter which way it was spun, this was a telemarketing position more than anything and not the kind of Enrollment Counselor position that I was looking for. Not long after my final interview I was contacted and offered the position. I was given a couple of days to think it over and was told I could call/email back with my decision. I ended up declining the offer. I emailed the contact and never even received an email back as an acknowledgment of my response. This left me feeling as though they were just looking to get someone in there to fill the position and on the phones as fast as they could. After reading previous Glassdoor reviews as well, that was the overall feeling I got from this place.", "Interview Questions": "How does this position line up with your future/career goals?"}, {"date": "5 Aug 2018", "title": "Enrollment Counselor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Drexel University Online (Philadelphia, PA) in Mar 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "3 steps: First was human resources.
