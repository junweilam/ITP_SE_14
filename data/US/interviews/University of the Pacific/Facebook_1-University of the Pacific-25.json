I heard nothing. \r\n\r\nTwo weeks later in May, I was notified by a reference that they were contacted (without my knowledge). I followed up with the school. I finally heard back. They wanted me to come to campus. Initially it was one day. Then it became 3. They paid to fly me from the East Coast. I visited all three campuses. No time to think. One meeting after the other. The time scheduled with some was too short, with others too long. I had to give a presentation.  Driven by Lincoln Town car to all locations. \r\n\r\nI was told on campus  they were going to check my references. (They lied. They didn't.) I was asked to think about where I wanted to put my office. (Strange) They took me on a residential tour and to see a marina (neither on schedule). \r\n\r\nThey required me to interview with yet another person by telephone when I returned from my overnight flight home. I did. I sent thank you notes to each individual person. I heard back from some, not others. \r\n\r\nI left Thursday evening, arriving home on Friday AM. I interviewed by telephone with the last person on Saturday afternoon (we tried to interview on Friday, but I missed the call - go figure; I called back, and heard nothing to Saturday).  Monday was July 4. I followed up on Monday July 11.  That afternoon I received an email from the a senior staff member who was my contact throughout claiming to have hired someone who had experience the opposite of mine. \r\n\r\nThe senior staff member, who was my contact, stopped responding. A secretary referred me to a low level staff person for reimbursements. This person's email responded on July 12 with an auto-reply saying she was out until the 25th. Yah. I haven't sent them yet. Why rush. No one is there to help me. \r\n\r\nOverall - they did a good job of being phony. They kissed my butt while I was there, but they never intended to hire me. I was the national candidate. They were dishonest in things they told me. Ultimately, they hired someone the opposite of me, who had a lesser pedigree than I had, and I felt it was a waste of time and resources.  The person they did hire was the same age and had the same look as the President. \r\n\r\nTheir behavior afterward, scurrying under a rock, ruined any good impression they gave me. I felt used and they clearly chose to cater to the chosen one, rather than wrap up their interaction with me in an appropriate way. It was a little too Los Angeles for Northern California. \r\n\r\nI wish I hadn't gone through the process. I feel like a used, discarded date.
