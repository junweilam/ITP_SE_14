I was told that I was being interviewed for an online therapy position.  I had extensive conversations over the phone with two different people including the person running that program regarding the online therapy position, I was applying specifically for that position. They asked if I would be willing to do a follow-up interview in person at the Northwest Clinic. \r\n\r\nThere were two people conducting the interview and one was quiet and one was very unpleasant. When I explained that I had talked to someone about the online position and that I was coming into interview for that, I was told they didn't have enough clients for that position and they might never have enough clients for online therapy.  To me this was very odd, as a therapist who works online part of the time, that is a thriving field and I have a very full caseload. \r\n\r\nI was told that the position that they had was a contracted therapist position in person at that clinic. I was really confused at that point and I must have looked puzzled, because the interviewer asked me if there was something wrong. I wasn't even sure what to say, so I mentioned that  I lived on the other side of town and I stated that I didn't know I was interviewing for an in-person position and that being from the other side of town that was quite a drive for me. The interviewer was very cold at that point and stated that I didn't need to finish the interview and that she lived over near my area (she was not that close to where I lived, but this girl was making a lot of assumptions).   I told them I might still be interested and asked them to please tell me more about the position. It felt surreal but I was trying to stay positive. I was told that this was a contracted position and that the pay was $40.00 an hour. My face must have shown a little shock at that number because they told me that obviously wasn't enough money for me and that the interview was over.  During the telephone conversation I had, I was given a much higher number and was told that this was a salaried position, with the opporutnity to see additional clients for additional pay. As a hard worker I had excited about that.  I  was quite shocked by the rude tone and the interviewer's attempts to assume my thoughts by 'reading' my facial expressions. It wasn't professional. \r\n\r\nI spent 10 years in public service, working as a therapist with high risk clients. I had an excellent resume and excellent references. Pine Rest has a great reputation, so I was excited to be applying for a position with them. At the very least I expected a courteous interview and a professional atmosphere. I was really disappointed. This is a big organization and I have had multiple postive interactions with their various programs over the years but I would never, ever even refer a client to this particular clinic. I think something has gone wrong there.", "Interview Questions": "They didn't really bother to ask questions.
