In addition to this there is a worksheet that you are to complete during the 30 minutes as well. I have no idea what is on the sheet because I misunderstood that that had to be completed within the 30 mins. Next you have 15 minutes to go over the interview questions. The questions are pretty typical. \r\n\r\nThis interview did not go well for me. 1) I misunderstood the directions so I didn't even get to finish the worksheet they gave me. 2) The interview committee did not seem very welcoming except a lady named Dawn who was there for interview compliance reasons. You come in and there are 4 of them plus Dawn sitting at a board room table with you at one end. I asked if I could sit closer to them but they said no which right away made me feel dumb. We've all been through interviews, I've had to interview people myself, everyone is nervous, the interviewers should be more welcoming and easy going. Maybe smile once in a while.
