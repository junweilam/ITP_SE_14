They sent me a link to register my answers to 5/6 questions to talk about my motivations and past experiences. Exercise took 30min, you have 3 to 5 min to prepare and 3 to 5 min to answer (depending the questions). I had 2 weeks to complete this exercise which allows some flexibility. \r\nIt may surprise in particular if this is the first time you are doing a video interview, because everything is timed and the software moves to the next question after the time allowed. But I found the questions easy and general, just need to be ready to build complete answers in a very short time period.\r\n\r\nSecond step, written assignment. 1 week later they asked to complete a very long written assignment with 3 parts: \r\n1)\tA memo proposing one specific new research project (700 w)\r\n2)\tAn internal memo proposing a three-year strategic plan for research and advocacy (1600 w)\r\n3)\tA dispatch (400 w)\r\n\r\nI know researcher and manager in another department and they never had such difficult assignment. Although I had 1 week to complete it, this is huge! I spent a lot of hours (unpaid of course) to work and propose several research and advocacy projects and to think about a strategy for this new position.  I understood the division I applied for is recent and they are building their strategy and building a new team with creative ideas. However, as a researcher, I found the exercise motivating and inspiring as it gives a small idea of what you could do.\r\n\r\nThird step, panel interview with 2 directors 2 seniors 1 associate. 1hour\r\nFirst, I found the Hiring Manager (HM) and the panelists not engaging and not really curious: not interested in my previous research experiences or my field works or about myself. It was supposed to be a conversation but they distributed the questions among themselves. Very few follow-up questions and very few technical/specific questions. Most questions were the same as the video interview.  I quickly understood that I was not the profile they were looking for. \r\nFurthermore, we did not discuss the Written Assignment. I had no feedback for the hours of work I spent and the ideas I proposed. No follow-up questions about the strategy or the research projects I proposed. \r\n\r\nHUGE lack of communication from HR.\r\nHR officer never answered my emails. There was a lack of communication since early in the process. First, when I noticed there was a typo on the due date for the video interview (I had to figure out by myself and contacted the video interview provider to get an answer). Then, I never had any update on my application, although during the panel the hiring manager mentioned that they usually get back to the candidate within 2 weeks and at this stage of the process - no matter the answer- they always provide an answer. \r\n\r\nI sent 4 emails (2 to HR/ 2 to hiring manager) not to mention that no one answered my thank you note after the panel...\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of silence that followed the panel interview, I was confused when I find out HRW released a joint statement with other organizations on a topic related to the dispatch I proposed. It was even the same picture I used to illustrate my paper. Anyone might find this coincidence puzzling...\r\n\r\nAfter my 4th email, the hiring manager told me that they were in the process of negotiations with another candidate, they were hopeful this would work but because of administrative constraints on their side they did not make a proper offer to this person but they were hopeful. In the meantime, they could not tell me officially that I was not the candidate they choose. He added that he gave me these answer because \u201cI flagged\u201d I have other opportunity. No kind word, not even sorry for the silence.\r\nI really do not know how a manager could give such unprofessional answer to a candidate who spent so much time in a recruitment process (almost 3 months). HR could have just said that they are still reviewing the applications or simply that they chose someone else. \r\n\r\nThen, I received a month later a courtesy note saying they indeed decided to offer the role to another candidate and to thank me for my patience. They did not give a real reason except the common \u201ca better fit for our needs at the moment\u201d. \r\n\r\nI knew the process could take a lot of time but I feel it is unfair to push someone so far in the process and provide so little feedback, update, response and consideration. This absence of communication within the agreed time frame in spite of a very demanding/time consuming assessment process does not reflect well on this organization. Nothing could justify such lack of consideration and professionalism from Human Resources or Managers. \r\n\r\nI hope this review will help candidates to prepare and above all the HR and Management to rethink their processes.", "Interview Questions": "What motivated you to apply for this position?\r\nWhat do you consider the most significant human rights abuses related to the exploration, extraction, production, transportation, marketing and combustion of fossil fuels?\r\nWhat experience do you have interviewing people affected by oil, gas and/or coal projects?\r\n\u2028What experience do you have working in difficult or challenging environments (such as insecure locations, hostility or remoteness)?\r\nWhat experiences do you have conducting advocacy with governments or institutions?\r\nWhat experience do you have interviewing people affected by oil, gas and/or coal projects?"}, {"date": "30 May 2022", "title": "Associate Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Human Rights Watch (Sydney) in Apr 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "Straight forward.\r\n\r\nFirst round is a video interview.

It was very pleasant and I enjoyed our conversation. \r\n\r\nThe next step was a skills test, which was around 2-3 hours. It wasn't difficult and just tested my ability to work under pressure.\r\n\r\nI then moved onto a second round interview with a larger panel of people. My first impression was that it was very corporate-like, but it was almost expected given the size of the organization. It was going fine until the executive director of one of the teams gave me a scenario question, then kept giving me obstacles when I responded, and finally insulted my intelligence in a condescending tone. It had nothing to do with the original question or my ability to perform my duties in the scenario. Perhaps he felt threatened when I pointed out a gap in his scenario that would make it irrelevant? (This is me trying to justify his actions) Regardless, I was honestly taken aback by the level of disdain and disrespect, even as he tried to play it casually in a way that shot my confidence for the rest of the interview. The whole team then proceeded to say they have the nicest and friendliest team, as apparently not every department is great to work with (a red flag). Honestly, I never expected someone working for a human rights organization to be condescending in a situation where you're supposed to make your organization an attractive, not repelling, place. \r\n\r\nPrior to my interview, I had read \"red flag\" reviews about HRW under-appreciating Associates and treating them as lesser-than, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. But ultimately, the interaction I had with the interviewers confirmed for me that I didn't want to work for HRW. If someone fighting for the human rights and dignity of all people treats a potential employee poorly during an interview, it can't get any better working under them full-time. At a human rights organization, it should be expected that staff uphold the basic tenets of human rights and respect others in the workplace.
