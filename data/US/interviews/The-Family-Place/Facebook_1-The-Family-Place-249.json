Both HR and the director got back to me on time and explained everything to me clearly; HOWEVER, as soon as I mentioned to them both that I needed time off for my own wedding next year and that date was non-negotiable, I did not hear back. I ended up sending them my availability form (per their request) and followed up a second time with no response, only to get an automated email from them right after that they were moving on to other applicants. A simple email explanation back would have been strongly preferred if they could be flexible (or not) for an important event that I am letting them know at least one year out in advance. Did not even get a congratulations either. Sadly, not the agency or company I would've felt comfortable being at long-term, even if it was for a PRN job.", "Interview Questions": "Be prepared in that they asked many situational/behavioral-based questions.
