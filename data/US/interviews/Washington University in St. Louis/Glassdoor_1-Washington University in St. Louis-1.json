One consisted of a personality test that let you choose words others would describe you as and what you truly would describe yourself as. The phone interview lasted about 30 to 45 minutes. The woman was from the Human Resources office at the university. She was very nice and she asked several interview questions. She might ask you to give examples of your work in certain situations and then would put you in a situation and ask you how you would react in that situation. After the phone interview, she had me schedule a computer test. They tested my abilities on Microsoft Word, Excel, and a Keyboarding test. I didn't do near as well on Word as I did on Excel. I used Excel everyday though and Word I haven't been familiar with since college. I do remember on the Word test you would have to draw graphs and add or subtract lines. Even before I took the skills test, the Career Services department head sent me an email and requested I interview with her. It was a very basic email, no emotion. I scheduled the interview two days after my skills test so I could better prepare. I was told my interview would be an hour and a half long in the career services center and that it would consist of 3 1:1 interviews. I interviewed with 3 women the day I arrived. They were all very friendly and I felt a wonderful rapport with them. They seemed very smart but still had a laid back attitude. They made me feel very comfortable and I am usually a nervous person. They asked your typical interview questions but wanted more detail in your answers. They asked for a lot of examples and how this job might benefit from your past experiences. My interview ended exactly when they said it would. I felt like it went extremely well but I sadly wasn't offered the job. The university is very popular and they constantly have applicants. I wouldn't be surprised if over 100 people applied for the position. It wasn't the easiest interview I ever had but it wasn't extremely difficult either. Altogether though, the interview process would be rated average to difficult. I wish the best of luck to all who apply. Just research the position and throw some facts in their direction.
