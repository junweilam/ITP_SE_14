I was contacted in early December for an interview. The interview went very well (or so I thought). It was an interview with three individuals, including an HR recruiter, the Corporate Outreach supervisor, and a Corporate Outreach representative. The interview was about an hour long. I was told that the position would not start until January because of the upcoming holidays, and that I would hear back sometime then. I immediately sent out my thank you letters and a week after my interview I received an email saying the position had been closed. I contacted the HR recruiter that was present at my interview, since she advised me to contact her with any questions I may have. When I asked her if the position was permanently closed or they had decided to hire someone else, she simply responded, \"The position has been closed,\" with no detailed information. Fine. \r\n\r\nFirst week of February, I notice the position had opened up again. I was still very interested in the position so I went ahead and sent an email to the HR Recruiter, asking if I should resubmit an application or if my previous application would be considered. After two days of not hearing back, I decided on my own to resubmit my application. \r\n\r\nEarly March I was sent one of those generic emails thanking me for my application, but they were pursuing other candidates, etc. This really soured my entire experience with Columbia Southern. I had such a pleasant interview and genuinely liked everyone but it was so unprofessional for the HR Recruiter to not have the common courtesy to return my email. All she had to say was that I was not what they were looking for. I found it so ironic that I applied to a position where communication was key, and yet, there was a complete lack of communication when it came to my application. \r\n\r\nI hope others have a better experience than I did.", "Interview Questions": "Describe a time you experienced great service. \r\nDescribe a time you had to deal with a difficult person. \r\nWhat motivates you?\r\nWhat experience do you have with organizing the most efficient/cheapest travel arrangements?\r\nHow do you organize your tasks?"}, {"date": "17 May 2014", "title": "Adjunct Professor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Columbia Southern University", "Interview Descriptions": "First interview with a Dean.
