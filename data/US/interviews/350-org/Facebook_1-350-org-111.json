I should have known that something was amiss, given the convoluted hiring process. Typically an HR rep will initially screen by phone or schedule an interview outright. The former happened, which led to a second phone screening with the department supervisor overseeing this position. We already seem to be at one too many steps. I specified that I was not a Skype user, so the second screening took place by phone. Then a skills assessment was requested, to be submitted via email. Upon completing it, I was granted another interview with a different HR rep and the supervisor. Normally I would have concluded contact with the HR department by then. Development informed me that this would be a Skype interview, though we already discussed my use of the technology. Apparently this would occur whether I had the app or not. The shift from asking to telling was swift. The organization does lots of business this way. I have no problem with it, but a preference was established and there's no telling what could have been gained by meeting in person first. They do have a physical office location, after all. Because the HR rep suddenly fell ill, the joint interview was postponed twice (mere minutes before the first attempt, to boot). The other HR rep wound up taking over.\r\n\r\nThe Skype session went as well as I or the interviewers should expect. There were multiple times when I was complimented on my answers. To have been rejected afterward was a source of great confusion, given the reasons provided to me. Skills, a lack of in-depth answers nor passion for their mission were cited! This is after excelling at a skills test, receiving kudos for my answers and getting this far in the process without explicit environmental experience. If the latter mattered so much, it stands to reason that I shouldn't have been interviewed at all. I sent credentials that they could pick over well before this started, and this seems like a tactic to depict \"equal opportunity.\" The kicker is that the first HR rep called me about another position that I'm just as (if not more) qualified for and wouldn't go any further in considering me, due to a stringent requirement of longevity. Meanwhile they have staff with no environmental background who've held multiple jobs in a few years time. This is a glaring inconsistency in hiring procedures which should be reported to an appropriate party. So how does something regarded as a \"plus\" and not a requirement eliminate me from the development job when I have plenty of other plusses? I received an explanation, but not one that makes sense. Only one can be chosen, and arbitrary means will best all other comers. Having to wait through a holiday weekend for that news after previous schedule adjustments was an inconvenience as well.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}]]
