I had two in person interviews with two people at the first interview and three at the second. The interview had a lot of questions regarding students and the care of the students on campus, which of course is a big part of this role. I felt that was a good quality in the interview. I however felt some of the questions were religion related and seemed to lack in finding a qualified person for the position. After two interviews I thought the University of Portland would do the correct thing and contact the candidates about the next steps or the decision to go with another candidate but they did not.

I submitted my application and was invited for a 30-minute phone interview a couple weeks later. The phone interview was with the director and the person leaving the position I was applying for. They asked standard questions, very simple.\r\n\r\nThen I was invited for an on-campus half-day interview. I had a panel interview with the office staff, a panel interview with community partners, and a 1:1 interview with the associate VP. These all went fine, very standard behavioral questions about what I would do in certain situations.\r\n\r\nI was emailed several days after with a final project that candidates \"were recommended but didn't have to\" complete. This consisted of creating infographics and an email based on a dataset I was given. It was a little strange, but easy enough for me so I did it.\r\n\r\nAnother week went by, and I received a very generic voicemail from the director saying they decided to move forward with another candidate. After a couple weeks, I looked on their website to see who they hired for the position, and this is what made me really angry. They decided to promote an internal candidate from their office to the position. Normally, I think this is fantastic, I think we should always promote internally when we can. However, this person was on my interview panel, and a big part of the interview process for me! Something is very wrong and inequitable about this. If you have a strong internal candidate, they absolutely should not be involved with the interviews of other candidates. I'm glad I didn't get the job because I don't want to work for people who promote inequitable practices.", "Interview Questions": "How would I engage community partners?"}, {"date": "4 Oct 2017", "title": "Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at University of Portland (Portland, OR)", "Interview Descriptions": "Catholics need not apply? That's the baffling feeling I took away from this experience.

With my response I was told by those interviewing me that they personally were not Catholic and that \"about 50 percent of employees are not Catholic.\" Awkward. Things  felt rushed and uncomfortable after this. The questions were pretty standard interview questions concluding with a quick tour. The process took approximately  25 minutes. Weeks later I received a phone call, leaving a message to call back. I returned the call to be informed I wasn't selected for the position but was told my resume was impressive. Awkward. I had applied for another position there, same department, but HR  rejected me for that with an email with no interview. I don't understand why the experience was so uncomfortable.
