After a thorough and prolonged interviewing process, it concluded on March 9th, 2023. The interviewing process spanned several weeks: \u2022 Nov 15th- Initial 30-minute call with an associate dean \u2022 November 21st- 3-person panel zoom interview with a search committee, chairs, and another Executive Assistant. \u2022 December 9th- I met with a dozen staff members over the course of three hours who conducted rotating 30-minute interviews with me during an in-person panel interview, which concluded with an hour interview with both Deans. \u2022 December 15th- was then asked for information regarding my references and the references were contacted and provided details about my background and skill set. \u2022 From December 15th to January 3rd, no communication efforts were made to contact me. \u2022 I inquired about salary and scheduling expectations on December 22nd, but no information was shared with me. When I followed up, I was told that salary information would be provided when an offer was made. I also asked about my direct support but received no response. \u2022 On January 20th, I had a 45-minute zoom interview with the Provost and President. \u2022 The offer was extended on February 23rd. When the offer was made, the title and expectations of the role had changed. Due to the changes, I requested a follow-up call with HR. I was scheduled for two follow-up calls within a 3-week timeframe, but both were canceled. On March 9th, the offer was withdrawn, and the position, I was told, was put on hold, although the position was reposted on the careers page on the same day. This position remains posted on their careers page as of the date of this review. When I inquired about the role being \u201cput on hold\u201d and yet remaining on the careers page, I was not given a direct answer. Throughout this lengthy interview process, I maintained a professional and flexible attitude. However, I would like to offer feedback and suggestions to the recruitment team at Lesley University to ensure that their recruitment efforts respect candidates' time and are equitable to all candidates. It is essential to offer a streamlined interview process that allows candidates to meet with their direct team and supervisors to provide insights into the day-to-day expectations. Communication with candidates should be timely and clear, and a designated contact person should be available to answer questions and provide straightforward answers. Recruitment turnaround time should be shortened to avoid miscommunication, and the salary range should be posted in the requisition to attract qualified candidates. In conclusion, I was disappointed with the interview process and would hope that professionalism and clear communication for future candidates is made a priority.", "Interview Questions": "How do you manage your time?"}, {"date": "6 Jan 2023", "title": "Administrative Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Lesley University in Sept 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "Extremely rigorous process and takes long time \nFirst received an email about wanting to interview me \n30 min Phone call from hiring manager \n1 hour interview with team \n3 hour interview with team, provost, community members, hiring manager.
