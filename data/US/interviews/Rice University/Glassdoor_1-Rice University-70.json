I learned it was a lot of administrative work. After interviewing I felt overqualified for the position based on my experience with other jobs. They asked some questions that I didn\u2019t feel needed elaboration on such as explaining what calendar coordination is/my familiarity with it. Even after explaining that I\u2019ve done it one of my previous jobs for 10 executives they still wanted me to elaborate more..it was odd to me that they asked how I calendar coordinate. They also asked if I was familiar with graphic designing and website design. not sure why they were pushy with that question because one of the interviewers clarified that they have dedicated team for those things. Asked if I was familiar with Microsoft and Google products, I said yes. They asked me to elaborate. I mentioned Mail merging, cleaning up data in excel. They didn\u2019t seem to understand that.. they asked what mail merging was and what data I\u2019m talking about and where I get it from. Any information that is put into excel is data.. I was also asked about my experience in building relationships with the community. Based on my previous jobs I explained how I build those relationships, etc. but they seemed to downplay a lot of my skills which I didn\u2019t appreciate. One of the panelists also talked a lot so it cut me on time to ask my questions. Also, did not inform me that I didn\u2019t get the job after I sent my thank you email. I personally felt like they wanted someone inexperienced and could maybe have more management over. Not upset that I didn\u2019t get the position because I was planning on saying no. Overall, my interview experience with them was not great. I feel like the panelists kept saying \u201cfor the good will\u201d too much as if I didn\u2019t understand what they meant and the mission of the university.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work here?"}, {"date": "29 Apr 2023", "title": "Research Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Rice University", "Interview Descriptions": "Applied during school year.
