Over the course of several months I lost track of how many people I met with. Position was for FT Remote. Hiring manager casually mentioned in one of the many interviews that I would be responsible for travel expenses whenever they wanted me to come to their office across the country. I had never heard of a company \nasking this of its employees. However I was told this was negotiable throughout the process and during the final round I was told the company would cover them. When I received the job offer I asked to confirm the expenses were included in it, and was told no. What company expects employees to sign up for on-demand travel out of their own pocket with no details of frequency, duration etc? They would not even compromise and agree to any # for a cap on my out of pocket expenses. Any manager or company that does not understand how that can be a dealbreaker for candidates is probably not one you want to work for.
