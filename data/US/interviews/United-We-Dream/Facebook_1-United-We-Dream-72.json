A week later, they invited me for a phone screening.  They set up my interview with GMT zone, even though both of us lived in the U.S., Then sent me a Zoom link.

All these small technical issues aside, they completely disappeared after this phone call.  They were supposed to follow up in two weeks after this call, but that never happened.  After three weeks, I sent them a follow-up email but never heard back from them! Extremely unprofessional and disorganized.
