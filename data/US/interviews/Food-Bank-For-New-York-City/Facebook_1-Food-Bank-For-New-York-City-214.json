I was very well qualified for this in my opinion of course. It started with an interview with a recruiter, followed by a panel interview over Skype.

I waited in the lobby for close to an hour for my interview. In addition, only 1 employee of the 2 was able to attend. I had to have a follow up phone interview with the missing manager later. I felt very confident that I would be offered a position soon. After weeks of no news I started trying to contact the recruiter that I had been instructed to direct all contact through. Despite multiple emails, calls and messages, he never got back to me. I know you are supposed to be patient etc, which I was. Finally, after it had been a month after my interview and no contact what so ever, I got a hold of the recruiter and he said that due to a new chief marketing officer there was a freeze on new hires. \r\n\r\nOverall my experience with the recruiter was poor.
