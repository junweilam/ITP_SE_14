As once one has rejected a job offer over pay. The ATS system automatically blacklist the applicant from all future reference. So I hope you will read on.\r\n\r\nMy interview experence I had an cumulative 5 round interviews. Phone interview ( 2 people ), virtual group interview, director of the department, CIO of the department and HR team.\r\n\r\n1st round interview - was conducted from who I know uderstand was another representative within the team as opposed to an official recruiter or HR which is the first red flag as it showed indirectly that the department lacks support when it comes to recruitment if the members within the team have to carry out the recruitment despite having officials in place that this responsiblity should fall under. The representative did not call me during the scheduled interview time. Prompting me to have to reach out. No one picked up the first time, so I called a second time and was greeted by the person who sounded like they just wanted their day to be over despite it being the morning. Another red flag but hey it's such a prestigious college so of course I overlooked it! \r\n\r\n2nd round interview - they were all present and on time surprisingly. They asked very light and generic questions causing me to have to carry the conversation and ask hard-hitting technical and behavioral questions. I found this to be a red flag. Especially when I turned the tables to ask them if they had any further questions they just looked confused. \r\n\r\n3rd round interview - this one was smooth and relatively short but again I was not asked nearly as many questions as I gave.\r\n4th and 5th round interview - was performed in the office the CIO gave a backstory on the founding of the college ( oh joy) and did their best to play off of the view I shared of the team members I met in what felt like an attempt to authentically give the impression that they took know each of the members well. HR team came right after and never once talked about the salary and instead kept trying to emphasize how great their benefits were ( another red flag). It wasn't until I got the job offer that I realized why that was. Despite their job listing showing the salary range for the position, I applied for they offered a salary lower than the shared range. \r\nThis resulted in me having to decline the job offer.
