They said it would be an opportunity to ask questions and learn more about the role, but it really just seemed like they wanted to take ideas from peoples' lessons, invest time to them, but they didn't really care to give proper consideration to diverse people- for example, this is where extroverted people will shine and demand all the attention and time. Felt like a complete waste of time because hiring team did not seem all that interested in candidates on an individual basis/ experience.", "Interview Questions": "Icebreaker- What is a different last name you would give yourself"}], []]
