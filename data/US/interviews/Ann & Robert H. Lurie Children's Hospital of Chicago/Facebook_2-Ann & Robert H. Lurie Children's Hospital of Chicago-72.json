Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago in Apr 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "I was approached by the executive search firm which handled the recruitment of this newly established position via LinkedIn. The recruiter sent me a message via LinkedIn and invited me to a phone conversation about the new position. Although I was not actively looking, I was interested in learning more about the position because of Lurie's reputation. My experience with the recruiter was not good and her approach resulted in me withdrawing from the hiring process before the recruitment team at Lurie had the opportunity to talk with me. During my first call with the recruiter, she was not adequately organized and did not send me the job description ahead of time, although it was available. She asked for salary expectations on the first call and current salary at the second email. The recruiter requested current salary aggressively via email threatening not to continue the interview process which in any case is irrelevant since I had already provided salary expectations. At the same time, the recruiter did not reciprocate by confirming a range that Lurie had in mind. In my 15 years of professional experience in healthcare, this was very unusual, disrespectful, and unprofessional, especially for this level of leadership position, when trying to attract professionals from other leading hospitals who currently hold leadership positions, and when it's a new position where institutional knowledge is still growing. In addition, the state where I am currently located has already banned the question on current salary to promote gender equity and although Illinois had not yet banned this question in the private or academic sector, it is still an unacceptable approach at this early stage of the process.  I emailed the recruiter letting her know that I will not continue the recruitment process as this is not a good fit and since our values are not aligned, and I never heard back from her. I hope that this does not represent Lurie's hiring practices, culture, and values and that this was a rare exemption that will not harm Lurie's reputation and human resources practices.", "Interview Questions": "What is your current salary?

First, I was called by a recruiter and asked basic questions, like if I was comfortable around children, why I was applying to this job, and what I thought this job was. I was also asked if I was interested in a different position, which I was. Then, I was told they would talk to the hiring manager about an interview. A couple days later, I received another call asking when I could come in for an interview. The interview was, at first, me talking to the manager of the department I was applying to. It was more of a \"getting to know you\" versus questions that were targeted. She asked basic questions, like about who I was, why I wanted the job. I used a lot of examples and spun my answers to show how I was a good worker. Then, I briefly met with the rest of the clinical research coordinator team and they asked questions of me, like if I was good at organizing. I was asked about my interests and if I was going to be capable of managing a lot of data. The whole process was about 45 minutes. A week later, I received another HR call offering me another interview. This interview was with the PIs of the team. They just told me about their research and asked general questions about my resume and past experiences. They said they were impressed and the interview was done after about 30 minutes. A couple days after this, HR offered me the position over the phone (which was a weird thing) and then we talked about salary.  They were not clear that it was an hourly position, so my negotiations were not very good and I am not particularly happy with the compensation. They were kind of pushy about me making a quick decision on the salary and position. Nevertheless, I took the job and they told me my start date was in two weeks. However, my start date got pushed back two times due to administration delays, which was very frustrating.
