This interview was basic - it discussed my work experience, interests, academic background, etc.  I was asked to complete a scenario test that would be emailed to me and due the next morning.  Immediately after the interview I was asked to return for an interview the next day with the hiring managers.  The interview with the hiring managers -  one who would be my supervisor and the other with whom I would be working closely, was very thorough.  It built on the basic interview I had the previous day and went further into detail about the position's demands, responsibilities and expectations.  I answered questions that focused in-depth on relevant work experience and as well as work-ethic/personality questions.  The hiring managers were direct, open to questions, and personable.  Immediately after, I was asked for three references and three business days later I received an offer from my recruiter via phone call.  I countered the salary offer.

I also wrote thank you emails after phone interviews and even hand wrote and mailed a thank you note after the in-person interview. Their communication with me stopped after the in-person interview.
