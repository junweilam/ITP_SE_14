When she finally did get back to me, she told me that she didn't think I would be a good fit for the role and that I would be frustrated with the job and her ability to manage me effectively. I found this to be incredibly discriminatory and judgmental, especially given that she had initially told me that I was highly qualified. To make matters worse, she then went on to say that there were other applicants who would be able to step into the role more easily and that the company wasn't interested in training anyone. She even went so far as to suggest that my location on the West Coast would make it difficult for me to succeed in the role, despite my qualifications and abilities.
