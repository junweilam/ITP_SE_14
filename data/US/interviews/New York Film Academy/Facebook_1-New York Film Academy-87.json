However, I was waiting, and waiting, and waiting for almost 45 minutes. Finally, I was greeted by the person who scheduled my interview. She brought me to a theater, where I would be meeting the hiring manager. This person stalled... and stalled... until she texted and tried calling the hiring manager multiple times to then tell me that the hiring manager was stuck in a meeting. I eventually met with someone else in the HR department instead, who was professional in interviewing me, but told me that this particular position I applied for would be to replace her. Overall, it seems like their HR Department is a mess with absolutely no semblance of organizational or prioritization skills. If an interviewer shows up at his or her scheduled time ready to interview with the interviewer as scheduled, it is completely disrespectful to leave the interviewee hanging.

That interview went well and she was very nice and seemed excited about my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and experience. They told me the job was for an \"Admission Specialist\" role and that they needed help in their recruitment tactics and their overall admission process. I was invited to come in for a second interview, which was also fine, again with another senior admission staff member. Felt like a standard interview. After that interview, I was brought upstairs to meet with the President. He was late to the interview and the interview took place in his office on this really low couch, which was weird to me, and it was so loud because the room was next to a dance studio so I was super distracted/couldn't concentrate on the questions. I offered him my resume after introducing myself, so he could have a copy to look over, and he declined, saying he'd already looked at it earlier. He then asked me where I'd gone to college and questions about my work experience that could be found on my resume. It was such a weird interview and I got such weird vibes from him and he just kept talking about how wonderful he is and how NYFA is not as prestigious as where I had gone to college or where I had previously worked, and that he understood where I was coming from because he had gone to Harvard, and that this would be different but that people really give it their all here etc etc. That should have been my first red flag. I was offered the position later that week and negotiated the salary up by 5-10K, I believe. But when they sent me the official offer, they had changed the job title without telling me, and informed me my working hours would be from 11:30AM-8PM, which they had never mentioned during the interview process. I ended up accepting the job, but quit shortly thereafter because it was not the right fit for me and it felt like a bait-and-switch. The job they had described for me was not at all the job they asked me to do when I first showed up.
