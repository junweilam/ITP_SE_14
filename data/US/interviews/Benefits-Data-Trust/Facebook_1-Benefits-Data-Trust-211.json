We arranged a time for a face to face interview. I arrived at their office and was greeted kindly by everyone. There were 2 interviewers, both the hiring manager and a supervisor.

Unfortunately, no call came in while I sat with the BOS, but she was very nice and told me a little bit more about the job. I definitely noticed that the company culture was not uptight or serious. They allowed employees to wear whatever they wanted, like jeans and t-shirts and the atmosphere seemed light. Truthfully, I was a bit hesitant given that it is technically a call center (an environment I thought I'd never work in), but it really appeared that the employees were happy. Also, windows line the contact center so it's not like it was located in an enclosed dungeon or anything. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think the interview process was great and I was given a clear expectation as to when I would hear back.

I spoke with a human resources manager and she described for me the company and what its senior-level employees do.  The initial conversation took over a half hour.  During the conversation, she did not really give me any indication as to what my position would entail. She glossed over it quickly, mentioning that I would be supporting all executive staff.  She was very easy to talk to, pleasant, and friendly.  She scheduled me for an in-person interview a few days later. She told me I needed to fill out the application and submit a writing sample over the weekend so it would be ready within 24 hours of the scheduled interview.  \r\n\r\nWhen I arrived for the interview, she met me at the door and put me into a conference room with one large table in it.  She admitted she did not read my application or writing sample, even though it was a requirement that I had it done immediately. She spoke with me one-on-one for less than five minutes, and then stopped me mid-sentence to tell me that four of the executives were going to come in and meet with me as well.  This wasn't a problem for me, but it would have been nice to know beforehand that I was going to be interviewed by five people at once.  I sat on one side of the conference room table, and the five of them sat on the other side.  \r\n\r\nThey asked general questions, such as what my experience entailed and what my goals are, and what my strengths are - typical interview questions.  Then one person asked me what my first day would be like at their company.  Being that I really did not have much information to go by, I said that I would familiarize myself with the company, employees, and general surroundings, and perhaps shadow someone for a bit or get trained - however they usually do it.  Turns out, I would not be trained in my position whatsoever.  Surprise!  \r\n\r\nI was in the interview for a little under two hours.  We were wrapping everything up and the HR manager slipped in that I would actually be the receptionist.  That was not the job I applied for, nor was that a job that I was looking to do, or had any experience in doing.  I am sure I looked a bit taken aback.  Then everyone cleared the room except for the HR manager, who then looked over my resume and application for the first time.  She saw my current salary figure and requirements, and said that the job is for $20,000 less than what I was looking for.  Again, this could have been avoided had she just read my application beforehand.\r\n\r\nI was not going to take the position had it been offered to me, but I did email and call to follow-up after the interview.  After a week of not hearing anything, I emailed the HR manager and she said they had not made a decision yet.  Two weeks after that, I did so again, and she wrote back quickly to say the position had been filled.  I understand they probably had many applicants, but I shouldn't have to chase them for a decision, even if it is a rejection.  \r\n\r\nOverall, I felt the company was quite sketchy, the executives seemed even sketchier, and the place was not run smoothly at all.
