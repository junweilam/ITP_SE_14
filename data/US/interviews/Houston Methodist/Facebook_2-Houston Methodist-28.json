I was only able to make it work by taking my \"lunch break\" during the interview that day.

It was two parts-- the initial part was with just the manager and started on the hour and lasted about 30 minutes. This mostly just consisted of her telling me about their center and asking me a few questions based on my resume. The next part, which was an interview with the team, was supposed to begin at 45 minutes after the hour, so I waited in the conference alone for a little more than 15 minutes. The team came in later than they were supposed to, and consisted of around 10 people (plus one on conference call) of different specializations. Save for a couple of people, most of the team seemed uninterested and cold from the get-go. In the midst of our interview, somebody tried to come into the conference room, so one of the team members started rushing the interview. I think that they only got three or four questions in before asking me if I had any questions for them. I asked a question that should normally have a detailed response, but just got a one-word answer. \r\n\r\nDuring both parts of the interview, everybody expressed how busy this job would be. That, along with the tardiness and aloofness of the team, didn't inspire a lot of confidence for this position.

The position was for the Sugarland hospital whole interview was about the diease process of patients. While I am cognizant that as nurses we have to have a vast amount of knowledge, knowledge should not be the only focal point. You can teach skills,however, you can't teach compassion or how well a person may fit into your current health team. A person can have a lot of knowledge and still not gel well with an organization or team. During the interview, I was only asked one question about myself. I feel there was more value placed on my knowledge base rather than the whole me. In nursing we emphasize holistic care and getting  to know several aspects of the patient. I feel we need to treat our prospective nurses in the same manner for examples, it's more to a person than just understanding different testing and lab work  for a patient with  CHF. How are their interpersonal skills?
