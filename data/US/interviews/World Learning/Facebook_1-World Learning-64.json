I also don't know where the POC were but I sure didn't see any during the interview process so I definitely saw what people here meant by the lack of diversity. For this job, the low 42k salary and nature of work seems to attract privileged upper/middle class (white from what I saw) people who don't have college loans, have help from their parents, and/or very little in college debt. A few of the red flags I noticed: they said even if a worker had experience with a country, they purposely didn't have that person work on that country. The way the management answered some of the questions regarding reviews here. The lack of diversity. The similarity of the people working there. The salary. The lack of upward mobility.  Also, other NGOs/nonprofits I interviewed with said before the interview process something along the lines of 'I'm sorry but unfortunately we don't offer relocation assistance, is that okay with you?' whereas here I had to ask the interviewers about relocation as it was automatically assumed you'd be moving on your own dime for a 42k salary; I know that moving on your own is standard with most NGOS but I like that others had the courtesy of letting people know and not making that automatic assumption.

There was no greeting or direction at the lobby.  They were running over 30 minutes late and never told me.  I sat there and listened to the entire interview for the candidate ahead of me, watching her through the clear glass of their conference room right next to the lobby.  When her interview was done, she left and no one came to get me.  I watched the interviewer leave - she walked passed me without a word.  Finally, a long time later, she came back to me very flustered.  I had to help her set up her laptop again in the conference room and connect with the program director [who was off-site].  The interviewer was inexperienced with setting up video conference calls and I had to do it for her, all the while trying to introduce myself and talk to her about my experience. When we finally connected with the program director, she only asked me a couple questions.  I know that I answered them very strongly - I was overqualified for the position.  The interviewer didn't have my CV or cover letter in front of her, so I had to give her a copy.  I expected her to ask me to reschedule the interview given all the technical difficulties, but she did not.  I was rushed out of the room after only 20 minutes, with the interviewer telling me that she hadn't had lunch yet that day.  The candidate before me had nearly an hour with the interviewer, and they didn't ask me any of the questions they had asked her.
