In the email the person said she would be reaching out by the end of the week to go to next steps after she evaluated feedback. That was a Wednesday.

The interview was conducted with one other person and we presented in front of each other, as well as two HealthCorps coordinators. There was a short panel-style interview following the presentations, and we were given the opportunity to ask questions. I'm not a fan of presenting or public speaking, but the coordinators were not intimidating and the environment was relatively relaxed. We then were asked to spend about 10 minutes on a written questionnaire, which the coordinators reviewed and then discussed with us each individually. \r\n\r\nDuring the individual interview time, they discussed some of my question responses in more depth and asked additional questions.  For this portion they also brought in a former HealthCorps Fellow who asked very vague questions, seemed super full of himself, and continued to push for very detailed answers to some common sense questions. He had an attitude and rolled his eyes a lot. When I tried to answer honestly, or provide some personal concerns I had about health and education, he questioned my response with some very assuming statements that i thought were ignorant. He also interrupted me a couple of times. I think the fact that he bothered me may have showed on my face towards the end and I'm sure that had an impact on the outcome of the interview. Prior to that I thought things were going well and my conversations with the two coordinators were very productive and cordial. \r\n\r\nHowever, they did not follow up with me, even after I emailed the main contact person for an application status update. I thought this was pretty inconsiderate given that I prepared a presentation and drove about 2 hours in the Sacramento heat for the interview. Overall, I got the impression that the Northern California HealthCorps Fellows are, for the most part, from more privileged backgrounds and are not given practical advice or training for working in communities with varied socioeconomic and racial demographics. They may have been one reason for the arrogance I encountered. If you do interview, it might be beneficial to be positive at all times, and refrain from critical statements (such as about the educational system or racial inequities), that may be perceived as negative.
