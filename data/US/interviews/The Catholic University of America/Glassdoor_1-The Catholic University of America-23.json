Apparently, I did so well during the screening, I was asked to come in for an interview. I was flattered.\r\n\r\nHowever, it snowed the day before my interview. The University had a 2 hour delayed opening. I was in constant email contact with one of the two interviewers, letting her know I was going to be there when the university opened if it didn't disrupt the interviewers schedule. She assured me everything was fine, and to be at the university when it opened.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the interview, I was greeted by the phone screener and the second interviewer. She told me that the other interviewer could not make it because the public schools were closed and he needed to stay home and take care of his child.\r\n\r\nShe and I continued the interview, with most of the same questions she asked on the phone being asked again face-to-face. The only other different interview question asked is given below. Whether I answered it properly or not (to her subjective liking) is another question. I'm assuming not, since she told me she'd call me \"In a couple of days,\" to reschedule the interview to include the other interviewer, but she never did.\r\n\r\nShe never even called to say the position was given to someone else. I called after 2 weeks wondering what happened (as I am from academia. This is the first time applying for staff positions. As a professor, I always received an email, phone call, letter, something that told me what was next). That's when she told me they offered the job to someone else, and if that person doesn't accept, then she'll contact me.
