The hiring director even emailed me herself to tell me I did a good job on the presentation.  HR was excited and hinted a potential offer was coming later in the week and voluntarily told me all about the hiring processes and start date, etc.   He explained that their hospital hiring process is different as in they do reference checks first before extending an offer whereas most hospitals reference checks are practical an offer.  My references diligently completed the skill survey throughout the week.  The recruiter insisted on scheduling a time later in the week to discuss a potential offer, but on that day all I received was a canned email stating they had moved forward with another candidate.  I'm certain this was about salary.  They coaxed me into revealing how much I was making by stating how there's the potential to be higher than the range they provided.  Since they're checking my reference, I caved and revealed my salary requirement, but reassured I was open to negotiating and they picked someone else.   Bully with a smile and passive aggressive snakes from hiring manager to HR.  Don't trust them! Leadership didn't even have the decency or courage to negotiate.  Worst interviewing process in all of the Boston hospitals I've been with!\r\n\r\nIn reflecting back, it was sketchy interviewing and HR practices.
