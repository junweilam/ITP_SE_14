It's unfortunate that they disrespect their employees consistently, and never promote from within. They are \"allergic\" to internal hires (I was told this by a senior person). I would recommend that you seriously consider NOT seeking a job here, as you will be treated callously and will have zero chance for advancement.

Told that I was to meet with the Chief of Staff and Director of HR regarding my candidacy, a meeting was scheduled 2 weeks in advance.

My materials were not even looked at and the meeting lasted all of 7 minutes (would have been much shorter had I not pressed my case). Having been in an active job search for some time, I can certainly handle rejection, but seriously, an e-mail would have been sufficient. I didn't need to waste all my time and effort to be told in a meeting that I wasn't being considered. \r\n\r\nI should note that this is not my first totally negative experience with this employer, and I should also note that I have been a long-time employee there with success in a wide variety of roles. It's unfortunate that they disrespect their employees consistently, and never promote from within. They are \"allergic\" to internal hires (I was told this by a senior person). I would recommend that you seriously consider NOT seeking a job here, as you will be treated callously and will have zero chance for advancement.
