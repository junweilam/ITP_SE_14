I was set up for a video interview with the dept manager and a staff nurse in the dept.\n\nThe interview itself went ok, there were no really difficult questions.  The dept manager was very friendly and did a few ice breaker questions to try to ease my anxiety.  Because I do something similar at my current job, most of the questions were about which processes I feel comfortable with and which I may need more training on.  \n\nThe thing that turned me off to this company was the staff nurse who was in the interview as well.  I had issues with my computer and wasn't able to connect to the video, they could only hear my voice.  I went out of the interview then back in 3 times before they came on and once when they were on the call.  I still couldn't get the video to work.  The staff nurse made this disgusted face and kept that face for at least a minute, you know that look.  Maybe she doesn't realize that sometimes people have issues with their computers at the worst times.  I'm trying to get another job, why would I purposefully not have my camera on?  \n\nThey never got back to me after that interview, not even a generic rejection email.  But I would have declined the job if they did offer it.  The nurse's facial expression was rude and made me feel bad.  I'm a nurse, not a computer tech, I don't know what to do if I can't get my camera to work after multiple attempts.  How do they react if their staff has technical issues? \n\nThey were telling me how impressed they were with my experience and the fact I'm in school for an advanced degree.  I realize interviewers just say that type of stuff, especially if they aren't an experienced interviewer.  But if this were true, they should have scheduled a follow up interview and by then my camera would be working (I got it working the next day after getting someone else to look at it).  \n\nAside from the nurse's facial expression, the interview was ok.  I would not apply to this company again, even for other positions, but the interview process was one of the easiest I have done as a nurse.", "Interview Questions": "They asked about what UM processes I feel comfortable doing and what I would need any trainings on."}, {"date": "2 May 2019", "title": "Social Worker Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at VillageCare (New York, NY) in Apr 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "Interviewing process was smooth.
