They asked very few questions that were related to the position, and instead, tried to ask me questions about myself and my hobbies. It felt a little unprofessional, and I was a little uncomfortable. After the 30-45 minute interview I was given a tour of the (insanely small) library. I was told that if I was contacted in the next week I would return for a third interview, & if I didn't hear from them, then they had gone in \"another direction\". A week passed, and I heard nothing, so I started applying for other jobs. After more than 3-4 weeks I was contacted by phone, asking if I was still interested in the position. The head librarian said they never hired anyone. I was emailed a \"real\" application, & told that I had to drop off a physical copy of an application, and then I would be contacted for the 3rd interview. When I dropped off my application I had hoped to speak to the head librarian, but I wasn't allowed inside the building, which was very odd. I sent a follow-up email to the head librarian the next day, asking if she had received my application, but she never responded. A week went by & I sent another email asking if there was any additional information they needed from me, which was again met with no reply. After 2 more weeks, never having had that 3rd interview, I was sent an email that thanked me for my time and said that they had hired another candidate. All in all, I had a very poor experience interviewing with the \"university\".", "Interview Questions": "The head of the department asked me what types of after-school activities & extra-curricular classes I participated in during high school. As a recent college graduate, that had completed multiple collegiate internships, I wasn't really sure how that was relevant. Full Sail is a liberal arts \"university\", & I have always been active in fine art and drama, so I thought that would have sufficed, but the man seemed upset that I didn't participate in band or play any instruments. It was very odd.
