That was about a 30 min conversation she really liked my background sense I worked for a similar agency and she told me she would send my information over to the Regional HR person that covers the Illinois area. Fast forward to a week later , I reached out to her to see if she had heard anything and she followed up right away stating she was waiting to hear back from them as they had been in and out the office. Two days later she let me know that he was putting a schedule so we could interview over the phone the next week. I did the interview about three weeks and have not heard back which he told me I would hear by the next week if moving forward. I just took this as not moving forward since no response was received. It's not a role I was absolutely in love with as the commute was at least and hour and they were on the low end of the salary even for being non-profit. When I spoke with the Indeed Recruiter she told me the cap was about 55k and when I spoke with the Regional HR he said the salary was 48-52k.
