Put in an application and was contacted by a recruiter the following week for an interview.  I was told Norton healthcare was very much student friendly, especially those who are on the track for healthcare. Well, that didn\u2019t seem like the case with my recruiter. I felt more attacked about the job being too hard for me while being a student. Constantly being reminded that the job was very hard and it\u2019s nothing like long term care (I mentioned that I had successfully completed a nurses assistant training course and was waiting to take my state test), and maybe I should consider doing part time because many students get in there and realize that it\u2019s not for them. I felt like she had something against me being a student and showed LITTLE interest in me and my dedication to serving others. I also felt attacked as a student. My ultimate goals is to be an RN, and someday a midwife. So, the PCA position was to get my foot in the door and get a kick off to my career in healthcare as I see myself doing nothing other than helping to change lives. I never felt so belittled in my life by a recruiter.  I saw Norton Healthcare as an opportunity to grow. To start as a PCA, move up to RN, and finish as a midwife.\r\n\r\nNot only did I feel belittled, I don\u2019t feel like the \u201cinterview\u201d reflected on my desires and qualifications. The recruiter knew I was a student when she pulled my resume and contacted me, therefore I felt it was unprofessional to even keep pointing it out as a \u201cflaw.\u201d Nor compare me to other students with a passion for healthcare.
