Upon undertaking the phone interview with Keith in the I.T. Department, he scheduled me for an in-person interview at the start of the next week.  That interview was held in Corrigan Hall with Keith and Eric.\r\n\r\nThe interviews themselves went well; there were no specific technical questions and mostly they centered around discussions of past experience, skills, and how I've handled similar events/incidents.  I found the interviewers to be cynical and negative often mentioning the difficulty they have progressing security initiatives, policies, and projects in the Academic environment or with the type of staff and faculty they work with; in essence, the politics of the place (which is conceivably better to know about prior to accepting a position). \r\n\r\nUpon completion of the in-person interview, as we were shaking hands, I was informed that I was one of two candidates for consideration who, in the interviewers' words, \"actually knew what he was talking about\" in the realm of Cybersecurity.  I was further informed that I would get a response either that day (Monday) or the next day (Tuesday) at the latest.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday I sent both interviewers a \"thank you\" email.  I received no reply to that email and no feedback was given about the hiring progress.  A week later (the next Monday) I sent a follow-up email politely requesting feedback.  I went back to the Seton Hall application website and was able to log into an account and check the status of my application which stated \"under review.\"  I did not receive any reply to my second email either.  Over 2 weeks later without any replies or updates, I called the I.T. Services Helpdesk and left a message on Keith's voicemail.  I left a polite message with my name and contact information, stated I had not received any replies, and inquired about the progress of their hiring process.  I received no reply via email or phone, however upon checking the status of my application on Seton Hall's website again, my status was changed to \"not selected\" by the close of the same day that I called.\r\n\r\nMy experience above is indicative of an uncommunicative, inconsiderate, and unprofessional environment.  Over two weeks of complete silence despite polite inquiries, gratitude, and offers to furnish any additional needed information were a large red flag for me that likely would have resulted in my declining an offer if it were made at this point.  I have had positive experiences with other organizations where I did not receive an offer(Hubspot comes to mind), but I have never encountered this level of lack of consideration for the candidate.\r\n\r\nThe position, over two weeks after my in-person interview, is still posted both on Glassdoor and the Seton Hall website.  I would be curious as to what became of the other qualified candidate and if he had a similar experience.\r\n\r\nSeton Hall is well reviewed one Glassdoor and came with a recommendation from a past employee who worked in Career Services, hence my original application to the role.", "Interview Questions": "Standard questions about how I would handle a situation, how I have handled a situation, and about my experience, skills, and previous employers.
