I liked the 10 different individuals I met over the course of all the interviews and was interested and inspired by this position. However, the final interview and way in which I was told I didn't get the position (it was down to me and one other) were incredibly unprofessional.\r\n\r\nAt the third interview, there were six people in the room, one on the phone, which was overwhelming. I enjoyed the conversations with everyone during the process, during the final interview I was told it was down to me and one other, that clearly I was qualified for the role, but they needed to ensure they chose the right person. Because of that, the final interview had a very different feel, as if they were nit-picking and laser-focused on what they felt were my negatives. \r\n\r\nFor example, I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to do \u201cgraphic design\u201d work in this role, and how would I feel about that. In the first interview, we\u2019d talked about how this role wasn\u2019t about work like that, I knew that and I didn\u2019t expect to be doing any graphic design work, that was already discussed. So I had to explain that I never expected I would be doing graphic design work in this role. The final interview felt like I was constantly defending myself, and defending things I\u2019d said in interviews 1-4. I hope this isn\u2019t the case, but it felt like they\u2019d already chosen the other candidate and wanted the final interview with me simply to confirm that choice by inventing and digging for negatives. \r\n\r\nAfter the final interview, I was told I\u2019d hear from them by the end of that week. After two weeks, I got an auto-generated generic email from HR \u201cno-reply\u201d address saying I didn\u2019t get the job, there were many qualified candidates, please try again.
