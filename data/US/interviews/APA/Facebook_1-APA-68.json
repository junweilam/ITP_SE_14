It was your typical developer interview where the interviewers fire off pre-planned technical questions without much respect to the interviewee and are skeptical of any work experience you describe without any basis for being skeptical. The APA also has unrealistic expectations of wanting to hire a senior Java developer with greenfield experience but not labeling the opportunity as a senior position with greenfield experience required. At the same time, the APA only is offering a non-senior developer max salary of $120K for the role. The APA apparently justify the salary on the basis that they're a nonprofit organization. To make matters weirder, during the interview, the interviewers insisted that I was on camera for them without all of the interviewers being on camera in return. So if you want to work for a company that requires you to be on camera when other people aren't on camera and work for below market rates with unrealistic expectations, then the APA is the company for you.", "Interview Questions": "Questions related to Spring Security"}, {"date": "10 Oct 2022", "title": "Engineer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at APA", "Interview Descriptions": "The process was not competitive .
