I felt that the interview itself went really well, only to discover that the job requirements had changed from what the origional posting had suggested. I was not given an offer because I did not have home health experience.  My 6 years of developmental disability experience with trachs, feeding tubes, catheters, etc.  My 8 years of hospital experience with orthopedic, cardiac, IV's, PICCs, Pluerx, Chest tubes, mediports, wound vacs, etc. None of it considered.

Furthermore HR failed to inform me that while testing for drugs in the Pre employment process that they test for nicotine. I'm not a smoker but celebrated with my roommates by having a cigar when when i accepted the position. Ultiamiy they refused me the job after I tested positive for nicotine and wouldn't even listen to my explanation. Was treated like a second class citizen or a drug addict because of a cigar. FYI,  if you are a smoker and passed on there timeline of there hiring process quit smoking long before you even consider applying (it takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks for nicotine to get out of your system and the pre employment process only takes 3-4 weeks.) but HR will not inform you of this requirment for employment. Also they try controlling there employees lives outside of work by not allowing you to use any nicotine products ( including e-cigs or patches for people who are quitting) furthermore they expect you to show them a script for every drug you are personally prescribed. And if they randomly  drug test you, and you pop for something that's prescribed to you but you failed to inform them of it (I.E. adderall, painkiller or some antidepressants) they will fire you anyway.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us a time where you were wrong?"}, {"date": "10 Apr 2018", "title": "RN Float Pool Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Beebe Healthcare (New York, NY) in Mar 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "Just asked to tell me a little about myself...
