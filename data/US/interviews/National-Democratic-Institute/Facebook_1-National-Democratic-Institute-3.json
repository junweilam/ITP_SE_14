I'm writing this review because I respect NDI a lot, and really hope that they can improve. \r\n\r\nMy first point of contact was with a woman from HR, who called me 15 minutes after our scheduled appointment time. The first question she asked me was whether I would be willing to take a lower salary.  She asked me to commit to accepting the job at a particular salary point, and told me that I would have to do this in order to proceed with the interview process. While I can appreciate an organization being upfront about their budget constraints, the manner in which this was communicated was really off-putting.  The interview process had hardly begun, and I was being asked to make a commitment before they'd asked me any substantive questions (and before I'd been able to ask any questions myself). \r\n\r\nDespite some misgivings, I said I'd like to proceed. I really do respect NDI's work, and I know that sometimes HR doesn't represent an entire organization. I was asked to set up a phone interview for the following day. \r\n\r\nThis (second) interview went well. I spoke with someone from the program team who was extremely knowledgeable and professional. I came away from this interview really hoping for an opportunity to work with NDI. \r\n\r\nThe following week, on Rosh Hashanna, I received a calendar invite for a third-round interview, scheduled for the following day. There was no accompanying note, just the calendar invite. The interview was to take place 20 hours after the invitation was sent, giving me very little time to (a) get out of my existing work commitments and (b) prepare for the interview. As I mentioned above, the invite also happened to have been sent on a major religious holiday--equivalent to Easter or Christmas. I get it, this happens sometimes, but given the extremely short notice, it was frustrating. Nonetheless, I accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\nThe third-round interview--like the second-round interview--was appropriate and professional. Although I hadn't had much time to prepare (I had to work extra in order to make time for the last-minute interview), I enjoyed learning more about NDI's work.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was impressed with NDI's work, but extremely disappointed in the interview process. The last-minute scheduling made it extremely difficult to prepare for the interviews, and the strange salary discussion left me feeling confused about whether to broadcast or downplay my skills and experiences. \r\n\r\nThere are a ton of brilliant and qualified people in DC, and I have no doubt that whoever got the job offer will be excellent. There's a good chance I wouldn't have gotten the job even if the interview process had been perfect. That said, NDI should know that its selection process has some major issues.
