The supervisor I spoke with on the phone offered an in-person interview  at the conclusion of the phone call and we scheduled it about a week later.

They expect an EAR (Example, Action, Result) response so it\u2019s going to bode well for you if you familiarize yourself with this process ahead of both the phone and in-person interviews. Since it is a behavioral interview, come prepared with very specific examples as they will ask you to specify if you response is too general. The formal structure of the interview made it feel slightly impersonal which I did not like as I was also trying to determine if I were a good professional fit for the supervisors/peer\u2014it was near impossible to determine personality of the team members in the interview given the rigid structure. You are able to ask questions at the conclusion of the interview!", "Interview Questions": "I can\u2019t remember specifics!

The strangest thing happened right off the bat after the initial greeting, she asked, \"I assume you just graduated?\" I paused for a moment because I had been out of college for many years and the position only required a HS Diploma. I've also never had anyone ask me about my education right away (or ever). I don't put the year I obtained my degree due to age discrimination and privacy concerns. So, I feel she was fishing to see how old I was.... I responded with a \"No...\" in a tone that was basically saying \"Why are you asking that?\" So yeah, that was odd and just a strange thing to say that you \"assume\" when no evidence suggests that. Also, I am very surprised in this day and age that people seem oblivious to the fact that people of ALL ages go back to school and get their degree. Trying to fish to see if someone is too young or too old based on what year they graduated, you are wasting your time and look foolish in the process. \r\n\r\nShe then went over the position and asked me a couple questions like why I applied and why I would be a good fit. Then,  she began out of nowhere to boast about her position and it was just again, odd. She told me it's 10-12 hour shifts but for 40 hours a week.
