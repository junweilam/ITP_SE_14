I was contacted 1 week later to schedule a phone screen, which took place the following day. I spoke with an HR coordinator and was asked basic questions about experience and goals, and why I wanted to come to Brookings. One week passed and I was contacted to come in for an initial in-person interview, which I scheduled for the following week. I spoke with the person who had filled my role most recently, and a senior member of another team with whom I would be working quite closely. Beyond, \"Tell us about your experience,\" and, \"Why Brookings?\" they had very few concrete questions. This seems to be common, so if you are interviewing at Brookings, remember that you will have greater latitude to control the conversation here than with other employees, and use that to your advantage. I asked many very specific questions about current goals and challenges, and was able to propose solutions to address both. \r\n\r\nAfter the first in-person interview, I was asked to complete an MS Word assessment and a writing assignment, both of which I was instructed to complete within 24 hours. This was absurd, and frankly disrespectful to demand of a working professional, so I negotiated for the time I needed.  At the same time that I was invited to complete assessments, I was also contacted to come in for a 2nd round interview a few days later. I met with the person who would be directly supervising this role, and the head of the program. Again both conversations were extraordinarily open-ended and collegial. I was impressed that regardless of the title, record or prestige of the person interviewing me, I was treated as a serious administrative professional with valuable skills to offer, which is not the ordinary experience for an EA in DC.  \r\n\r\nAfter the 2nd interview, I was asked to complete an official application and submit references by 5 PM that day. Again ridiculous, so again I had to negotiate for a reasonable timeline. \r\n\r\nI submitted the requested materials and then waited 2 weeks before emailing my HR contact to request an update. I was contacted a few day later and invited back for a third interview, this time to meet the rest of the team in a more relaxed social environment. \r\n\r\nI met with the team several days later, after which I was contacted within 24 hours with an official job offer, which I accepted, and instructions to complete a background check. \r\n\r\nThe background check took a full week to complete, and my HR contact reached out to let me know my background check was complete, and to schedule my start date. I asked to wait 2 weeks to start, so that I could give my employer notice, and my start date was set for 2 weeks later.\r\n\r\nOne note: If you have interviewed in person several times, it has been a few weeks since you've heard anything, and you are anxiously awaiting an update, please keep in mind that decision makers are often travelling, and that it can be difficult to get everyone in a room together to finalize a decision.

Here are my two separate experiences interviewing with them.\r\n\r\nI first applied for a junior-level staff position. The hiring manager scheduled a phone interview with me, and failed to call me when the time came. After I followed up via voicemail and email, we rescheduled the call to a new time, and I was asked to call her instead. When she picked up, she immediately said, \"I can't talk now, let me put you on hold\". She didn't give me any time to ask any questions at the end.\r\n\r\nI was then asked to come in for an in-person interview. It went fine, and I felt there was a good rapport. A few days later, I was asked to do a written assessment with very short notice; they sent it to me on an afternoon, and requested that I turn it in by 10am the next day. I did that. A few weeks later, they asked me to fill out a new job application. I did that. A few weeks later, I got an automated email from HR saying the position was cancelled. The hiring manager emailed me a few hours later to say that there wasn't enough money after all for the job, but that she thought I was a strong candidate and urged me to reapply for new positions in the future.\r\n\r\nAt this point I still had very positive feelings about Brookings. So when I entered grad school and saw that they were looking for graduate interns, I applied right away. The website said that interns would be paid $10.50, which I thought was wonderful. They called me for a phone interview, and at the very end, the hiring manager told me that the internship would actually be unpaid. \"The website has incorrect information,\" he said, but assured me that the rich experience of working at a place like Brookings was enough of a perk to make up for zero pay. I was startled. Not by the fact that Brookings doesn't pay most of its interns (this is very common in DC), but by the fact that this seemed to be intentionally misleading and dishonest -- why couldn't they have corrected the information on their website, or at least told me about this up front?\r\n\r\nDo I still respect Brookings and the quality of its academic research? Yes, absolutely. Would I apply for a job there ever again? Honestly, no, I doubt it. I think people who work at Brookings have been so comfortably nested in their \"we're the best think tank out there and everyone would kill to work for us\" bubble that they no longer recognize the importance of treating external job candidates with the respect that they deserve.", "Interview Questions": "Do you have experience working with data and analytics?"}, {"date": "29 Jul 2015", "title": "Communications Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Brookings Institution", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied online through a job board (indeed, internships.com, glassdoor, something like that) and then got an email saying they wanted to interview me on the phone.

Received an email mid-Jan from the department to schedule a 15min. phone interview with the director of the project and a senior researcher. They apologized for getting back to applicants so late, so normally the process doesn't take that long.\r\n\r\nPhone session a couple of days later went well. I was asked why I switched careers to research and how I got interested in their topic area. I spoke about how it impacted my class work and part-time ra job, what my views and understanding of the subject was. Basically, they wanted to confirm that you knew what you were talking about. Two weeks later, received an email from the department to schedule an in person interview with the same pair. \r\n\r\nMet at office a week later. Spent half an hour with hr going over my resume, career change, classes, and activity since graduation. It was the most detailed questioning I've had for any job to date. Lots of follow up questions. Surprisingly, there were many about my spouse and what they did. That was strange. She asked if my references were up to date and I said I'd check on an older one and get back to her.\r\n\r\nWent on to the director and researcher and talked for an hour and a half about the job, my past experience, and stories about things we had in common. There weren't any hr-type questions and they were direct and straightforward. They asked me to send a writing sample. I thought the interview went well and there was a real rapport. However, they said they were doing two weeks of in person interviews, then at least one more round after that, maybe more.\r\n\r\nSent thank you emails with follow up materials the next day. Didn't hear anything for three weeks. Sent an inquiry to hr. Haven't heard anything since. I've heard that it's normal now for companies not to contact you with the results after an interview, but this was disappointing as they were otherwise professional.\r\n\r\nIn all, it seems like a wonderful place to work with people who care about what they do. God only knows how many applications they got. Frankly, it\u2019s a job lottery for overqualified candidates. The position only  called for a BA and I have two MS\u2019s.
