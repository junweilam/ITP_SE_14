They scheduled 3 1 hour interviews with the hiring manager, technical lead, and senior software developer. Those interviews went very well, my background was a great fit for the position. Next came a take home coding exercise, building a sample JavaScript application. I completed the exercise, and was scheduled another 1 hour code review session with the technical lead. The feedback I received was that it was a great submission. After 12 hours of take home exercises and interviews, the team was excited to invite me to Boston for an onsite interview. I'm usually hesitant and skeptical of onsite technical interviews for positions in another location, because the companies usually don't respect my time and may ask questions during the interview that could just as easily be asked remotely. They kept contacting me about the onsite interview, and the recruiter told me they plan on offering me a position. I asked if there would be any whiteboard coding exercises during the interview. I usually don't agree to onsite interviews with whiteboard coding for several reasons, but one is that I would be traveling and probably wouldn't get a good night sleep the night before the interview.  The recruiter reached out to the team and responded that there wouldn't. I agreed to travel to Boston for the onsite interview. I arrived in Boston at the hotel the night before the interview. Guess what, the hotel was right next to the hospital, and there were traffic and beeping noises all throughout the night. I couldn't sleep well. I believe I drifted half asleep for about 1 hour. The interview was scheduled for 8:30am EST, which is usually very early for me because I live in CST. I arrived at 8:30 to meet the team. I was taken to a small room with a conference table and whiteboard. The room was very hot and humid and I started sweating profusely as they discussed the process. They insisted that I stand up and draw on the whiteboard as I described the architecture for a system without any preparation time. They asked me to draw mock-ups as well, with very vague direction on what they wanted out of the system. They were making this up as they went, describing functionality to make it more complicated as I tried to ad-hoc the system design on less than 1 hour of sleep on a Monday morning.  My brain wasn't functioning 100% due to lack of sleep. They asked me to write a SQL query on the whiteboard. I started going along with it. I started laughing and turned around and pointed out that they said there wouldn't be any whiteboard coding exercises. I struggled through more of writing the query while bent over sweating profusely in the humid conference room. They eventually asked me to go back to drawing more mock-ups, I was basically coming up with requirements and functionality off the top of my head because their requirements were so vague. Eventually they had enough and directed me to go have coffee with the team. I grabbed my backpack and we walked to the coffee shop. I chatted with the senior engineers. The hiring manager eventually joined us. I went to the airport directly afterwards. I didn't hear a peep from this company after the interview. Actually, I did hear back from them, only when I had to send about 15 emails and wait 2 months to be reimbursed for my travel expenses.

I applied online and received an email from an HR professional asking if I could come in for an interview. I had a first round interview with the manager, which went positively. About a week later the HR contact emailed me asking if a few days the following week would work to come in and meet with other members of the team and a senior manager. I responded within an hour saying yes to one of the times. Then I never heard back. I emailed her again a few days later checking in, and didn't hear back. The next week, the day before the time I had confirmed, I figured she probably wanted to cancel, but just to be sure, I emailed one last time to make sure I would not be coming in the next morning for a second round. She emailed back at 6:30 saying she had had a busy day but that we were all set for 9 the next morning. I was shocked but did not want to postpone since I would be interviewing with multiple people. So I went in the next morning for 9, feeling not as prepared as I would have liked. My contact was late, and said that unfortunately since \"we had scheduled this interview so last minute,\" only the senior manager was able to meet with me, not the rest of the team. I was surprised, since I thought the only communication mix-up was this woman not getting back to me. My interview with the senior manager was alright, but as I said I was a little frazzled at this point. Afterward the HR woman sat with me again and talked for awhile about company culture and a lot of random things, and said she would be in touch to set up a third interview with the team. I said that would be fine, and reached out a week later to check in. She emailed back saying they were still making decisions, and then I never heard from her again.

I was scheduled to interview with the recruiter and then 3 different employees in the department that I would have worked in. The interview with the recruiter was pleasant. However, when I went to the other building to interview with the other people, I found out that 2/3 of them were not there today and so I only interviewed with one of them. That 1 interview seemed to go well, although I was not asked many questions about my experience. I was told that the recruiter would contact me early next week. So I sent out my thank you emails and waited. After 9 business days of not hearing anything, I sent a follow-up email to let the recruiter know I was still interested. He said that because it was around Thanksgiving, other interviews were more challenging to schedule and that he would get back to me soon.
