A recruiter called to schedule the call for the following week. It was fairly long (about 45 minutes) and consisted of very broad theoretical questions about my experience with communications. Not particularly difficult; just very long and exhaustive. The following week I was contacted by a completely different HR person to schedule an in-person interview. By this time, it was mid February.\r\n\r\nI was scheduled to interview with four different people--an HR person (different from the recruiter and person who scheduled me), a communications manager, a marketing manager, and PR manager. The first interview was with the HR person for about 30 minutes. It was pretty generic--asked about my experience, what I think about diversity. The next was with the communications manager. She asked the same questions and a few extra job-specific questions. This lasted about 50 minutes--she continued asking more specific questions, as the PR and marketing managers were running late. One of them finally showed up and started the next process. She asked me the same questions as before. Then the other showed up and had me start all over again. After the interview concluded, they walked me out, said I'd hear back. The whole thing was very redundant.\r\n\r\nAfter asking each person various questions, I learned that the company went through a major re-org over the past year in which a lot of new people were brought in (and it was implied, though not directly stated, that others were pushed out as a result.) This position was being refilled only a few months after the position had been created as part of this. I didn't get a great feeling about it.\r\n\r\nWell, now it's mid-May. I never heard back from anyone.\r\n\r\nAfter going through these interviews that never actually built on one another or gave me a better idea of how the role interacted with the company AND taking the time to drive all the way out to their Edina campus, I would have expected at least a quick canned email rejection or update on the job status. That was never received. I accepted another position shortly after the interview, so I wasn't that broken up about it, but I was really struck by the lack of respect that Children's Minnesota seems to have for potential candidates.
