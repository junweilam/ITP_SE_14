After the phone interview, I was invited to an in-person interview. The HR recruiter was very nice and friendly, as was the Licensed Professional I interviewed with. \r\nHowever, I had a few issues during my interview and hiring process. During my phone interview, the HR rep outlined two different MHPII roles at Fraser, and discussed which one I was being considered for. However, when I arrived at the in-person interview, I was interviewed for the alternate role.  I called the HR rep out on this discrepancy, and she apologized for the confusion, and stated that several roles had changed internally, leading them to  change to requirements of the position. Understandable, but it was still not communicated to me, and put me in a tough spot during the in-person interview. \r\nDespite this issue during the interview process, I accepted the position. My second concern arose when I received my employment paperwork. Fraser advertises clinical supervision as a benefit of employment, and having internal supervision was a strength of the company that HR really pushed during the interview. However, when I received my employment contract, I also received a supervision repayment clause. Furthermore, when HR sent my paperwork, they gave me a 24 hour deadline to sign and return all paperwork. Since individual supervision at Fraser is actually scheduled as unpaid time, and I was not told of this expectation during my interview process, I was very uncomfortable with this clause. I contacted the recruiter and told her I may have to rescind my acceptance of employment based on this clause and their lack of transparency regarding this. HR immediately set up a call with myself and their Compliance Rep.  I was told in this call that Fraser would be changing their policy regarding this, and I did not need to sign the clause. \r\nHowever, I have now learned that Fraser continues to require repayment for supervision time should clinicians leave before a certain time.\r\n**So, long story short, Fraser may not require you to sign that contract if you push them on it, and I highly recommend that you have a discussion with them about it.**", "Interview Questions": "Educational background, work background, questions regarding knowledge of ASD, perspective on behavior, how to supported children with no/limited language, etc. "}, {"date": "6 May 2018", "title": "Preschool Teacher Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Fraser (Richfield, MN)", "Interview Descriptions": "HR was really polite and went smoothly.
