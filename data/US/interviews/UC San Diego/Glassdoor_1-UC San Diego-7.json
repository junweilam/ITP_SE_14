Then they asked scenario questions where I had to assess how to prioritize amongst fluctuating tasks. I was contacted 3 days later to move forward to the 2nd interview.\r\n\r\nSecond round: two hours - interviewed with two professors separately \r\nThe first professor focused on my travel arrangement experience and how I would manage communication on different time zones. Professor also inquired about my financial management experience and how I kept track of short-term and long-term projects. Professor also inquired of thinking about a method of how to respond to all their emails in a 24-hour cycle. The gist of this interview was that the professor mostly discussed what they wanted to obtain out of the candidate rather than ask direct questions.\r\nThe second professor interview was the most difficult one of them all because the questions required quick answers even though some of them required thought. For instance, professor wanted to know how I preferred communication when I did something wrong - would I want to be taken aside to discuss the matter or would in front of my peers be ok. Bu then the professor asked about a time when I worked with a difficult person, how I managed, and how would I hypothetically manage in this environment (UC). I felt that the professor had a grill-down approach.\r\n\r\nI have a positive outlook of the interviews but I have a negative outlook of the decision-making process. The position was ultimately cancelled on the basis that the professors decided last minute that they wanted a candidate who had grant writing experience and the original job post didn't have that requirement in the qualifications list. Under UCSD policy the job post needed to be reposted with the additional qualification rather than re-reviewing the job applications of the original post.
