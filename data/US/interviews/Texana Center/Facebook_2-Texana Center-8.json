The interview went well and the manager I interviewed with was very nice. \r\n\r\nI got an offer but the HR department decided my perfectly valid diploma needed scrutinizing and were just searching for reasons to not give me work. I have never seen an employer waste so much resources to prove something they can infer from the two college transcripts, multiple diplomas from multiple stages of education and work history. It was pretty clear the HR person did not like how I looked and chose to scrutinize.\r\n\r\nOverall, I didn't get the job.

I would say both interviewers were really negative about the position, especially the second interviewer. Once I arrived before asking me any questions she immediately said \"this job is really stressful and we have a high turnover rate.\" I was asked some questions about my past employment and general interview questions.  she let me know about all the challenges of the jobs and asked me how far away I lived and if I would want to take a long drive to get to the clinic everyday. I think she was just trying to feel me out to see if I was going to last but I almost feel like she was trying to convince me I didn't want to work there. At the end of the interview she let me know she would have to ask HR if I could work there because my college major wasn't a type of social science degree they've had before. Long story short HR emailed me that it didn't qualify.", "Interview Questions": "How do you like to be managed?"}, {"date": "14 Mar 2019", "title": "QMHP-CS Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Texana Center (Wharton, TX)", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview was very professional.
