In fact, I don't even know who it was because -- as I told them repeatedly -- I was unable to hear. When their phone cut out, you'd think they'd reschedule -- or at least take off their headset and move to a quiet location -- but I suppose pushing through the questions was more important than the candidate being able to hear them.\n\nThe questions were basic; so basic, in fact, I wondered if they even read my resume. Of course, there was a tell-me-about-a-time-when question and a what-do-you-think-you-bring-to-the-organization question.\n\nWhen it came time for me to ask questions, the interviewer basically read from the \"Our Values\" page on the website, or was unable to answer what I asked.\n\nI was asked about salary and willingness to travel.\n\nThe next steps sounded a bit disproportionate to the position; prepare to have to complete an assignment (unpaid, of course) as part of the interview process.\n\nFor an organization touting its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, it's incredibly ableist to pressure a candidate to continue with a phone interview when they repeatedly tell you they can't hear. Unfortunately, there's a power imbalance in this situation; a reasonable interviewer would say, \"I'm sorry. Let me turn off my headset, move to a quieter location, and I'll call you right back. If we're still having trouble, I'm more than happy to reschedule.\"\n\nBut I guess interviewing qualified candidates is just too much of an inconvenience for HR.", "Interview Questions": "\nTell me about a time you had to have a difficult conversation."}, {"date": "7 Dec 2021", "title": "Associate Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Nonprofit Finance Fund (New York, NY) in Aug 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview process had multiple rounds - it was a mix of behavioral and case interviews.
