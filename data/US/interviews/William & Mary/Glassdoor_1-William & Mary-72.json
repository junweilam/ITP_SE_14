I didn't want to be labeled as just another person who had a bad experience and needs to vent to anyone who will read my review online so I feel somewhat relevant. Truth is, I have no problems with the College itself. I'm sure it's a great place and great people work there. But my experience during the interview process was something I never experienced before and felt like I needed this to serve as a \"hey, this could happen to you\" warning for others.\r\n\r\nI waited over 3 months before I was contacted for a phone interview after I initially applied for this position. After that, it was another couple of weeks before I got a call back with the \"Hey, we'd like you to come out and visit.\" I live 700 miles away from Williamsburg, so travel arrangements had to be made. \r\n\r\nThe first indication that this wasn't going as well as planned was when they asked me for dates and I gave them some that fit within both of our schedules. I also gave them dates when I would be unavailable (like, literally traveling and not just sitting in meetings at my job). The person I was in contact with came back and wanted to do it on a date that I said I was unavailable on. Once again, I had to clarify that I was not available on that date.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally settled on one, I asked if I could see the flight itinerary before it was booked. I wanted to make sure I could get the time off, make to the airport, get to Williamsburg with enough time to find my way around, etc. Over a week later I get an email saying my flights were booked with no explanation as to why I wasn't able to see them first. As I feared, the flights that were booked weren't accommodating, so I had to email and call back several times to talk to someone to get them fixed. While they ended up fixing them for me, it was only after the whole \"I don't know if we can because it costs just as much to change a flight as it was to book it.\" Well, why didn't you send me what you were thinking FIRST like I asked before we ran into this problem? This all happened only a few days before I was schedule to fly out (3 days I believe). I was ready to back out at this point. Such awful communication.\r\n\r\nFast forward to the actual interview. Everyone is very friendly when I arrive. I was scheduled to have lunch with about 4 people; people who I would only interview with/interact with during that time. These are people I would be working directly with if I was offered the job. I was told a few hours before lunch that they were now unable to do lunch anymore (all of them) because they had a project they needed to finish up before they left the next day. I was told I was on my own. I was also told I could take a tour of campus, but because my interview sessions in the morning ran late, I wasn't able to get to where I needed to be in time. So, I had over 3 hours of nothing to do before I needed to be back. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was fine, and everyone else I met throughout the day turned out to be very nice and professional. I thought.\r\n\r\nThis all happened in July. It's now November and I have yet to hear from someone there that I didn't get the job (I know I didn't because they posted the name of the person they hired on their website). What kind of organization goes to all the trouble of having you come out after screwing up your travel, blows you off for a scheduled lunch, and then doesn't bother to send a \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" email or make a phone call? Maybe it was because I asked them to put me on a flight that actually worked for me instead of one they decided would work and they had to spend more money to change my ticket when it could have all been avoided. But I think it's because of their unprofessionalism. I even followed-up with them a few weeks after my interview asking them if I could know what the status was and if they need any more information from me. All my attempts to hear back were ignored.\r\n\r\nHere's the thing: as interview candidates, we are expected to be professional and perform at our best. Only the best talent gets hired. But the way I felt after interviewing with William and Mary is the exact opposite. Very little follow through, an application/interview process that took nearly 8 months, and very little professionalism on their end, in the end. \r\n\r\nPerhaps my experience is an isolated one, but regardless of how good (or poorly) you interview, I believe an employer owes you, at the very least, some type of communication as to whether or not you will or will not be offered the job, especially if you were a finalist for a management-level position.", "Interview Questions": "What interests you about this position?"}], [{"date": "30 Dec 2015", "title": "Adjunct Lecturer Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at William & Mary (Arlington, VA) in Jun 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "I was contacted via Email.
