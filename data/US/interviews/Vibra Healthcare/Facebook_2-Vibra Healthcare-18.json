Same thing, interview went well. But I looked them on Glassdoor before my second interview and the ratings from their own IT staff were concerning. I also looked them up on LinkedIn. First thing I noticed immediately, absolutely no diversity representation whatsoever! All white mean and white women no black or brown employees that I could see, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist but scares me in 2022. The work culture also seemed a bit stifled. I asked questions to probe into their work culture and management styles. I asked things like \u201cOutside of an employee\u2019s paycheck, what do you do as a manger to reward great work performance.\u201d The answer I got was \u201cI promote from within\u201d YIKES! I also asked \u201cwhat do you to increase employee morale during difficult work periods or after strict criticism?\u201d Whatever the answer was I can\u2019t even remember which speaks volumes. Not even two hours after my interview I noticed the position was reposted to Indeed. I reached out to the recruiter a few days later after getting an automated denial email from HR. I asked the recruiter and asked what was the feedback that resulted in the decision to not move forward. She told me she didn\u2019t have anything she could share. Again, speaks volumes.
