I watched the woman who would eventually interview me take another candidate in to her office, which made this interviewer 30 minutes late for my interview. There was no where to hang my winter coat (it was snowing outside or I wouldn't have brought it!), so it was awkward to sit on it during the interview. The questions were not difficult, and I felt we had a good conversation. She explained the job and training and what benefits might be available to me once I transitioned into a position with benefits (flex nurse = 32 hours week, no benefits). The recruiter also explained that I would meet with the floor manager after our interview. If the floor manager liked me, she would have me and a couple other candidates come back to shadow a nurse on the floor for a morning.\r\n\r\nWhen I met the floor manager, I felt that I had no connection with her. I handed her my class journals from my L&D experience, and I explained how women's health is my passion and my entire reason for changing careers. She explained that she was going to ask me five questions with no correct answers. They were typical behavioral-type questions. At one point during the interview (still holding my winter coat), she reached over to me to try to catch a \"bug\" above my head (nope, that was fluff from the winter coat I am still holding).

I wanted this job badly, and maybe I seemed desperate, but at one point toward the end I uttered, \"I hope you like me\" to which she said, \"Well it's not a personality contest.\" As she was walking me out, there was a code in the hospital and the rapid response team ran over. She explained the code to me as though I had never been in a clinical situation before.
