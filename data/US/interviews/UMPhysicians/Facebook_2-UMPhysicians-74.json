For patient representative positions, those with strong customer service backgrounds will do well, as this is what they are looking for a lot of the time. I had absolutely no healthcare experience, but had customer service skills, which landed me the job. I had a panel interview because at the time there were several patient rep positions open as well as some other administrative positions, which ultimately gave me the opportunity to choose which clinic I wanted to work in.
