Combine that with their less than 3% \"merit\" based raise structure and I would be taking a pay cut every single year I worked there after Cost of Living / Inflation.

At the interview, I arrived a few minutes early and ended up waiting for a good 15 minutes. I met with someone from HR and the person who would have been my manager. We discussed the position in depth, and I asked questions which turned into a solid 50-minute conversation. I thought we were almost done, until they started reading from a two-page list of questions, many of which were redundant based on what we had just talked about. This position was actually a bit underneath my experience level (it was entry level and I have 5+ years of related experience) and the pay was 45% less than what I was currently making, but I was looking for something new and thought this could be a foot in the door. While the interviewers were friendly, my would-be manager actually blatantly offended my experience with one of her comments stating \"This position with us is clearly so much more involved than what you have been doing in your current role at XYZ.\" It was rude, presumptuous and made it abundantly clear that she wasn't listening to a word I had been saying about my experience, or that she had even read my career documents. The position also did not allow any overtime, but required you to meet sales quotas. When I brought up the concern of wanting to meet goals but needing to cap my hours, they seemed to think \"I would figure it out\", and I couldn't help but see it as potentially being set up for failure. The next step in the process was going to be a formal 10-minute presentation in front of a room full of people, which seemed extremely excessive for an entry-level position at that offered pay. The interview lasted nearly 2 hours, and I followed up and told them it would not be a good fit. Most of my negative experiences came from the manager in the room.
