She had asked if I knew what the job entails (including violence, poop being thrown etc) and I said yes (due to reading the reviews online). I knew what I was in for, and was still willing. I got introduced to the unit, and a girl was acting out and eating paper. The interviewer was very cautious about me being there and closed the door as if she would attack me. I had thought in my head \"She's just a child I am not scared of her\". I got hired as an on-call, this process was very abrupt and fast the next day I was asked to come in immediately to sign papers. They were very strict about this, and it was hurry hurry hurry!
