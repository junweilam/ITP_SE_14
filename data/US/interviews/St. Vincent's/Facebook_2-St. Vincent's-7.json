Spent time preparing for a formal interview and was well prepared to answer just about any question they would think to ask. Actually the interview turned out not to be much of an interview at all. It was an online virtual interview and as soon as I connected to the chat I was advised that they could see me but I would not be able to see them. This was actually very awkward and a bit annoying straight out of the bag. Manager proceed to talk almost non stop for about 5 minutes without really asking me anything then she said she was going to leave and tend to something and let a couple of other people come in and talk with me. They came in and introduced themselves, although I could not see them. They also proceeded to talk and ramble about the position and then asked me If I had any questions. After that the manager came back and asked me the same thing, if I had any questions and that was basically it. All total it was about 30 minutes of rambling then they rushed me off the chat and I could tell they were ready to go and very vague at answering any questions.\r\n\r\nSynopsis: The whole interview felt rushed, awkward, and uninteresting from the very start. Within the first couple of sentences I could tell the manager was not interested and I knew right then it wasn't going anywhere. It actually crossed my mind to end the interview my self but I figured since I had came this far I might as well sit it out. I felt that they were simply just going through the motions since I had been selected as an interview candidate.
