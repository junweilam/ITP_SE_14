I was contacted by the talent/ recruiting specialist to conduct a 60-90 minute phone interview. The specialist was very friendly and was able to provide a reasonable list of dates and times that were available to move to the next process. The phone interview went pretty well and the questions were quite basic. Overall, the experience was a \u201cget to know you\u201d and \"how do you start your day\". Everything lasted about 30-40 minutes. \r\nThe specialist also asked my salary requirements and briefly went over the job summary which is very helpful to read (study) prior to the interview. I would also recommend printing that as well as your cover letter, resume, questions  as well as words or short sentences that highlight what you want to say just in case you get nervous and forget or if phone interviews are simply not your forte. \r\n \r\n2nd:  After the phone interview, I received a second confirmation the next day to conduct a second face-to-face interview with the lead manager the following week. Again, the specialist provided a variety of reasonable dates and times. I arrived 10 minutes early and I was able to check in with the receptionist whom seemed very friendly. I waited 5 minutes pass the interview time but I was in no rush, I figured I would use that time to relax a bit and clear my mind just so I can conduct myself more naturally without sounding too nervous. The manager came out very excited and genuine. I peeped out the atmosphere and it was cubical setting and obviously anyone in charge had a personal office. There were already employees observing me and were asking me if I were new, very kind people. We got to the managers office and that's when I was asked the million dollar question: \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d. From there everything went very smooth. I asked my two questions and after that, that concluded the interview. (Interview time: approximately 45 minutes)\r\n\r\n3rd: That same day the specialist sent me an email but this time is was to conduct a third interview with a panel of 5 (which included the manager). The panel consists of a group of employees with different time in service but they all held the same position. It was at first intimidating but actually pretty interesting as I got to the questions. Most were \u2018team\u2019 based questions, past experience, my current job role, why did I choose HealthPartners, and sharing my personal experience with leading a group.\r\n I have to be honest, I was getting tired. I sort of felt like I was repeating myself and I was losing their interest. But I can tell they probably understood. The manager acted as a sort of an observer and would ask one or two follow up questions. Overall, this panel interview was not as scary as I was expecting but all the interviewers were very friendly and very interested.  \r\n\r\n4th: Last, I received a phone call from the manager and offered me the position and went over pay and new hire orientation, and future advancement.
