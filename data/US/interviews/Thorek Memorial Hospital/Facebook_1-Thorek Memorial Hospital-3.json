I then met with the supervising RC for the floor I would work on. She was rushed and unprofessional in the interview. She spent the majority of the 20 minute interview talking about the position, which was helpful, but spent no more than 5 minutes total allowing me to speak to my qualifications.

Met with the HR who was nice but didn't talk about the job itself; she insures the application was fully filled out. Next, I met with one of the hiring managers (I was told I'm going to meet with another one manager afterwards). The first question she asked me was why I left my old job. After learning why I left my last job, she start asking me personal questions that DOES NOT related to the job nor my ability to perform the job. I felt VERY uncomfortable, I felt like I was being judged. At that moment I really want to ask her how is that relevant but thought it was rude to do so and thought she would stop after I gave her an answer but she keep coming with more personal questions. Her voice was not nice at all, not one smile. She kept raising her voice like I am criminal or something.  She keep emphasizing that this is a secretary position as if I can't hear her and describe the position and which department it is. I'm glad she can read my uninteresting face when she told me which department it will be and also gave me a good reason to exit the interview without being rude.  My impression was that manager was more interesting in my personal background more than my work experience and obviously she wants to scare me away from the position. The entire interview was mostly asking me personal questions. As far as I remember only 3 questions related to job: why did you left your last job, have you work at a hospital before (it's listed on the resume if she would look) and are you interested in this position. To come to think of it, I'm not even sure if the personal questions she asked  violated the code of ethic", "Interview Questions": "Why did you left your last job?"}, {"date": "29 Aug 2019", "title": "Nurse Practitioner Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0I interviewed at Thorek Memorial Hospital (Chicago, IL) in Jul 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "They got back to you in a timely manner.
