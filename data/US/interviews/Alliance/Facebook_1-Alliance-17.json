The phone call was vague and didn't mention the position I had applied for. I didn't recognize the name of the company as well, but found that my application had been passed through by a talent recruiting company (Zip Recruiter). I decided to do some quick research on Alliance since I had never heard of them. Their website is a complete facade. They make it look professional, but if you read the text and view several pages, something smells fishy about the whole business. I then looked up their address on Google Maps, only to find that it's a warehouse next to a farm field.

I was soon to be unemployed (contract work), so I applied to many roles I found online and could not remember what role I applied at with Alliance. In the email Alliance sent me, they never told me the role I applied for. The email only said to call them to schedule an interview. I called and I told them all about my experience working in marketing at Microsoft and advertising in Seattle. They said I was a good fit and that they wanted me to interview. I asked them what role it was for and they couldn't tell me. I then told them I was sure I applied to something in the marketing realm and then asked for a job description, and they couldn't give me anything. We scheduled an interview and they told me to dress business professional- which I thought was weird because I'm an adult who has been in the workforce for a while and I know how to dress for an interview. I don't need to be told how to dress. \r\n\r\nAfter I got off the phone, I went to their website and it looked very fake. I went to the company culture section and it had pictures of the office. It did not look very professional. In addition, all of the employees looked really young. I feel like the person I spoke on the phone with did not make the connection that I've already had a lot of experience working with some pretty big agencies and companies. This place is a waste of time for me. I don't know why they thought I would want to go in for an interview.

I don't even think there was a position there for a PR assistant. I went through 3 rounds of interviews to where I received a job offer. The job was to be a marketing assistant. They kept saying this isn't sales its marketing. However, if it wasn't sales then why was your weekly salary based off of commission? They told me I would only get paid if someone were to use the code I gave them after my pitch and that I'd have to worry if I didn't get anyone to sign up. I'd rather have a normal day-to-day job where I know I'm going to get paid for the hours I put in instead of one where you could possibly go home with nothing. \r\n\r\nYou go through 3 different job titles until you get to a Manager title where you get an annual salary, benefits and double commission. This normally takes 12 months to 18 months or longer/shorter depending on you. \r\n\r\nAs for the questions, they were pretty straight forward. The first interview was a 15 minute introduction type where they got to know you and asked you some questions to see if you were a good fit. The second round was a longer interview which went on for about 45 minutes. After that interview if they wanted you to go to the next round you had to take a small quiz type thing. It asked what the best skills were to have for the job, the steps to a convo/pitch, why direct marketing works for their clients and consumers, and what other questions you'd like to ask. This \"quiz\" then went to the boss where he reviewed it and decided whether or not you should meet with him to go over your interview process.
