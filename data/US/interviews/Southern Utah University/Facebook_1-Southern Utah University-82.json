I was told beforehand that I would be asked a series of HR questions to get to know me and that I would have to teach two topics from a list they provide at the interview, one I get to choose, one they chose.   The oral part of the interview lasted approx 1 hour and contained a lot of questioning.  After the oral interview I was asked to stick around for a flight check interview in the school's Cirrus SR-20 aircraft.  I had no experience in this make and model and they understood that and was told that they would be looking at my general airmanship skills.  The flight lasted about 45 minutes and consisted of the usual aircraft checkout stuff, slow flight, stalls, steep turns, emergency descent and a landing.  At no time did they really say whether they liked what they saw and were pretty much silent other than telling me what maneuver to perform.  In the end of the flight the chief pilot shook my hand and asked if I had any questions.  I didn't, and he said he would call within a couple days.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work here?\r\nHow many checkride failures have you had?\r\nWhat is your best quality as a flight instructor?\r\nWhat is your worst quality as a flight instructor?\r\nTell me about a time you violated a regulation or got into an unsafe situation?\r\nHave you ever had an accident/incident?\r\nWhat is lift?\r\nWhat is angle of attack?\r\nWhat are your future plans as a pilot beyond instructing?
