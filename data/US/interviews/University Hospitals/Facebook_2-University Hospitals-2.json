Lasted over an hour.  I was then brought in for a 3 hour onsite interview.  The process began with a peer interview for an hour.  It was more of a big conversation with very unorganized questions being asked.  I then had an hour interview with two of the managers.

It immediately peaked my interest, and I decided to apply for it.  Received an email requesting a phone interview from an HR recruiter about 5 days later.  That was followed up by an in-person interview on March 20th, 2017 with the hiring manager as well as the hiring manager's direct boss.  The interview went well, and I walked away from it feeling both confident as well as a bit peculiar in regards to a statement made by both managers.  They stressed the need for expedience in getting a qualified candidate in as soon as possible, which left me with a hint of worry.\n\nFast forward almost two months to May 16th, 2017, when I received a phone call from the recruiter in which I was offered the position.  I explained to the recruiter that my current company was in the midst of planning for the coming fiscal year, and that my leaving in the middle of the planning process would create a massive responsibility vacuum.  In addition, I wanted to leave my current company on good terms, and leaving amid the craziness of the planning process would definitely be considered a burnt bridge.  Finally, my current company incentivizes employees to stay through the planning process by offering a bonus to everyone who is on the payroll when the process wraps up.\n\nDue to the aforementioned reasons, I requested a July 2017 start date.  This was absolutely negotiable, and I assumed the recruiter would need to get this approved.  The recruiter indeed stated they would need to check with the managers, and get back to me.  Three days later, my July start date was approved, and I received an official offer letter with the desired start date, salary, etc. which I accepted.\n\nA little over a week later, I received an email from the recruiter stating that my start date would need to be revisited, and to get in contact with them as soon as possible.  I responded and asked what had changed to necessitate moving up the start date, as it had previously been approved.  I received no response for over a week, during which I placed several phone calls and emails only to come up empty.  The recruiter finally responded via email roughly 10 days later, only to reiterate the same \"we need to revisit your start date\" line without providing any justification for doing so.  I again responded promptly, asking why.  Once again, I received zero responses for over a week.\n\nThe recruiter finally phoned me on Monday June 5th, 2017 and gave me a company-desired start date of June 19th.  I contacted the recruiter the next day (June 6th), and reminded them from our previous conversations that starting any sooner than when I requested would put my current company in a bad position.  I would also lose out on a significant amount of money for leaving a mere 11 days early.  The recruiter stated they'd need to once again speak with the managers to see what could be done, and if they could compensate me for the lost bonus money.  Once again, I did not hear from the recruiter for a week.\n\nLast Tuesday (June 13th), the hiring manager's boss phoned me to see what was going on.  I explained that I received an official letter with the July start date, and that I was never given a reason as to why the recruiter was pushing for a different one.  The individual then began to get irritated, and questioned my communication style as well as heavily insinuated that what I was doing was unprofessional.  The individual accused me of withholding information from the initial interview back in March, which was absolutely and truly false.  I was nothing but forthcoming as to why I requested the start date I did.  The conversation devolved from there, and culminated in me declining the offer based on the lack of communication from the recruiter, the attempts to change an official start date without providing justification, and the accusatory tone the hiring manager's boss took with me before I even started the job.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have contacted the hiring manager and their boss directly once the line of communication between the recruiter and myself broke down.  Alas, I did not, as I incorrectly assumed the recruiter knew how to do their job.  Furthermore, I did not want to throw this recruiter under the proverbial bus before I even started the job, and I had an official offer letter with my desired start date to go off of.  I truly feel this is an isolated incident attributable to the recruiter not getting proper authorization for my requested start date, then attempting to right the ship by bringing me onboard sooner.  Finally, calling a future employee's communication skills, professionalism, and credibility into question before they even start the job is the absolute worst way to start off a professional relationship.", "Interview Questions": "Why do you want to work for University Hospitals?"}, {"date": "20 Mar 2017", "title": "Radiologic Technologist Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at University Hospitals (Cleveland, OH) in Jan 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "I thought the interview process went really well.

The phone interview lasted about 30 to 45 minutes and was basic questions about my background and experience as well as personality questions.

During this time I was able to ask them a few questions and they also looked over my resume.

I was there for a total of about 45 minutes. \r\n     About a week later I was contacted by the HR recruiter again to set up a second interview as well as start a background check and have my references contacted. For the second interview I met with the head doctor again and he asked me basically the same questions he asked the first time. I also met with one of the department managers and he asked about availability and the commute time to and from the hospital for me. I was then given a tour of the lab by a few of the current andrologists and embryologists. After the tour I met with each of the employees individually and I was able to ask them some questions and they also asked me some questions. This part of the interview was a bit awkward because it was obvious none of the employees knew exactly what to say or ask of me. It seemed like they were unaware that they would have to sit down one on one with me. This whole interview process took a total of about an hour and a half. I was told I would hear back from them either way within a week.\r\n    During the next week all three of my references were contacted. Throughout the entire interview process I was able to go online to the careers website and check the current status of this process. At this time the status said background check in progress. I still hadn't heard anything a week later so I called the HR recruiter and left a message with her asking about the status of the position. After several days I still had heard nothing so I called her once again and left another message asking her to get back to me. I never ended up hearing anything back from the company at all. The status on the website continued to say background check in progress until 2 months later when it finally was updated to not selected for position.

Again, everything went quite smoothly with this, and she was very pleasant on the phone.\r\n\r\nNumber of interviews: There were 3 interviews. One over the phone with a nurse recruiter, which went very well. This interview was mostly questions about whether or not I was even truly eligible to work there (i.e. have you ever been charged with a felony) and then a few behavioral questions. Then, there were 2 in-person interviews with the nurse manager and the manager's assistant. These interviews also went incredibly well. I felt very confident that I had a shot at the position. This is when things went south. After all of the smooth communications, I heard nothing after the interview for 3 weeks and then got an email saying this, \"Although we appreciate your interest, we would like to inform you that we've decided to pursue other candidates for this position.\" I got no feedback at all as to what had caused them to wait 3 weeks to tell me this and was just strung along all that time thinking I might have had a shot. I even called and asked if they could give me feedback, so maybe I wouldn't make the same mistakes again or something, but they refused, saying it was company policy to not do so (understandably I guess, but still incredibly frustrating). \r\n\r\nPerception: I felt that Rainbow did a great job with the interview process right up until the end there. The phone interview was great and the in-person manager and assistant interview were also very smooth and comfortable. I just don't understand why they needed to string me along for 3 weeks just to email me and say I didn't get the position.
