Informative. Very fast. The recruiter offered me far below a competitive market wage for Registered Nurse ICU. I have many years of experience in the ICU and would be an asset to their system.  The nurse recruiter also became offended when I tried to negotiate for more money and told me I wouldn't get more anywhere else. She could not have been more wrong. I received another offer of  $6.00 more hourly (before shift differential kicks) somewhere else and I accepted that position. I only asked her for a couple dollars more per hour, but no dice.   I last earned what the recruiter offered me seven years ago.  I also have interviewed for jobs at several other healthcare systems and can confidently say that Oakwood/Beaumont is the lowest paid....by a lot.  I have a feeling that Oakwood/Beaumont is probably filled with bedside RNs who have little to no experience due to the low wages. I feel sorry for the patients, because an experienced nurse is an asset to any organization both for mentoring newer nurses and in patient care.  The recruiter told me I should be grateful to be a part of their organization and not surprisingly I was not offered any further interviews due to what I believe was due to me trying to negotiate a competitive wage. My references are excellent, so I know it wasn't the background check(but I don't think it ever reached that point).  Her attitude was \"yes we low-balled you, but you should be grateful to have a job because I have 700 other applicants who want to work here.\"  On the way out, the recruiter told me to check online regarding the status of my application. Haha, that is code for \"you are rejected.\"  \r\n\r\nI am comfortably employed and while Oakwood has many other decent attributes and benefits(not the best, but not the worst, I need a fair wage to live on.   I feel like I dodged a bullet and am happy to be an RN that does not have to grovel and accept less than I am worth. I'm looking forward to earning $6.00 more hourly somewhere else. I would bet money that the nurses who say that Oakwood/Beaumont pays well have less than five years experience.  My new job includes full benefits and time off similar to Oakwood. I start next week.  This is Oakwood's loss. I'm positive that many other experienced nurses besides myself with ten plus years have rejected their offer of peanuts for a salary. Oakwood/Beaumont: invest in your nurses and they will invest in you which will lead to less employee turnover which in turn will lower the cost of training all these new grads and inexperienced nurses.\r\n\r\nI have learned (the hard way) that employers who are willing to take advantage of good employees financially are willing to take advantage in other ways, i.e. \"expand\" your job description unofficially or expect you to help out dead weight co-workers sans reward. Skilled employees who benefit their employers have to stand up for themselves and discard the idea that their employer is doing THEM a favor by offering them a job. Healthcare jobs are a dime a dozen. We have a choice of where to work.  This is a case where there are too many administrators which has become a problem in nursing.  Eliminate some of these useless administrative positions and pay the people who are the building blocks of the hospital more.\r\n\r\nPaying less than a competitive wage is a red flag for a lack of professionalism in my book.

It was a number of weeks before I was finally contacted by HR personnel, and I'm pretty sure they already had full contact information of 3 manager-level and higher references.  They request that you bring in original versions of all of your degrees and certificates (hint:  you can leave them in the frames - they take photo copies of them and give them right back to you).  While in the HR office, I also met with the HR Rep.  If I recall correctly, she already contacted my references and I thought she was going to make an offer to me on that visit.  To my dismay, she did not.  I can't recall how soon after an offer was made but I received a phone call, an e-mail, and a written letter with an offer eventually.", "Interview Questions": "Describe a most favorite boss and why was he or she your favorite boss."}]]
