I gave her the additional info, told her I was okay with the added responsibility of driving 100 miles per week to Irvine (generous on my part).  After that I heard nothing.. they didn't even have the courtesy to let me know they had gone in a different direction. The saddest thing, is that I was overqualified for this position, and an Alumni of Alliant. For them to treat me like this, speaks volumes for the Admissions office, and the entire school in general.
