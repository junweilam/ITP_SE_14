One of the hiring managers looked like she got back from the gym. I assumed it was a very laid back environment based on how they were dressed. \n\nThe first question I was asked was to tell them about myself. In all interview practices and previous interviews I was always told to not get personal and talk about my previous experience on how it is relevant to the job I am applying for. One of the managers was annoyed, slammed his pen on the desk, and cut me off and in a rude tone asked what I liked to do for fun. \n\nAs the interview went on one of the other managers turned off his camera to go answer the front door. Basically it was one hiring manager answering all of my questions and he doubted my skills and said \"We are trying to convince older people to come spend $50k-$70k here and walk away with a single piece of paper in 4-5 years.\" I was also taught not to challenge the interviewer(s). His camera was also facing the side of his face, so when he spoke he wasn't looking at me. The interview was rushed and they showed no interest from the beginning. \n\nWhen I asked questions and I asked about the culture of the GCU and their depts. I was applying for, the manager that was rude proceeded to tell me about his management style saying he was blunt, etc. Which was also a red flag for me.\n\nThey made me want to quit and I did not even have the job yet. \n\nCommunication was lacking after the interview. It has been two weeks and there has been no email about my receiving or not receiving the job. It's of course safe to assume I did not get it, which makes it easier on my end to save me from sending a rejection email. \n\nI spoke with a few of my other HR relatives and friends and it is safe to say that the hiring managers at GCU for that Admissions Counselor Dept.

Interview was 30 min long with an HR person.  VERY basic interview with questioning focused on my resume, pay with corresponding companies and highlights of my sales accomplishments.  Nothing creative with the questions here.  HR person spent a significant amount of time explaining that training would be in AZ starting on 9-5-17 and continuing for 2 weeks.   Then back to AZ for 4 days in mid-October.  Asked if I had any conflicts with these dates or the travel.  HR explained pay structure which is NOT negotiable.  Interesting, I've never had the experience in an interview where they tell you the pay and to pretty much take it or leave it.  The position was advertised at $65k and that was the \"Level 1\" pay.  Quota metrics were based on how many new students you get to enroll with the online program, 28 for Level 1.   In a year you are eligible for level 2, 40 students @$70k, year 2 Level 3, 50 students @ $75k.  In the subsequent year you have the option of going to level 4, 60 students @$90k.  \r\nAlso discussed was free tuition and some other benefits.  Kind of a weird situation/place.  I have been out of full time work for over 2 years but doing consulting on the side, so I said yes to everything question related to my availability.  \r\nI was asked how many years experience in Higher Education I had, I said more than 25 yrs.

I usually send in a \"dummy\" resume first, something very similar to my job experience but with a spoofed identity to see what they do or don't respond to. It was very nearly immediately rejected - something like a few hours passed before I got a \"no thanks\" email. \r\n\r\nI looked for things the employer might be biased against to edit out. I dropped my first two jobs, which were in a more manual labor/service environment based on previous experience helping friends doctor their resumes for Grand Canyon and other similar \"Sales, but we call it something different\" jobs. Bingo! Grand Canyon is biased against people who had labor jobs, Lord knows why, but pretending I never broke a sweat while making money snagged a phone interview right away with identical practical experience. \r\n\r\nThis is where it gets pretty weird: I got the regular screening email. It's \"can you work this shift, is this pay acceptable, can you commute to our location\" stuff. It's designed for very basic answers, and it's pretty much binary. Either you are willing to take the job as it is, or you aren't. I filled out the form in a very basic, unobjectional way. \r\n\r\nOne day later they sent me a rejection letter. It was in fact the identical form rejection letter they sent my first \"dummy\" resume. Something turned them off, I guess? It would be useful to know what for future interviews, so I sent a letter asking what red flag had popped up and disqualified me. I was very politely told to screw off. \r\n\r\nI've been rejected at first application before, plenty of times. I've been rejected less times at the interview stage. I've never had a screening call cancelled for no apparent reason before, though. Just overall very weird.\r\n\r\nAnyway, tips! I have a few friends who have interviewed here before, so here goes:\r\n\r\nThey absolutely prefer you to either have a degree or be working on one. I had a friend get to the interview stage who had to explain his medically necessary year-long hiatus from his degree program, and that was enough to get a \"We would rather have someone who is *actively* pursuing a degree, but thanks.\" rejection. \r\n\r\nGrand Canyon hates people who had jobs they view dumb people to hold. If you want an office job, may moses bless you if you were a police officer or a carpet cleaner at some point. The base assumption made is that those people couldn't have done those jobs and still be capable typists or salespeople. Again, don't ask me why, because it's not my culture, but just edit those references out.\r\n\r\nOne friend who lived a few miles away was rejected for wanting to commute on a bike. He explained after being told that they needed \"reliable transportation\"(he lived a mile away and had a $1000 bike) that he also had a car, but preferred to bike for exercise when possible. It apparently soured the interview. He related that it had a very \"bikes are for poor people\" feel.\r\n\r\nTL:DR; Grand Canyon set up and then reneged on a phone interview for reasons they refused to explain and were terse and unhelpful when asked why. Grand Canyon hirers for \"desk jobs\" will, based on the experience of me and a handful of friends, reject anyone who lists any kind of manual labor or service industry experience. One bicyclist friend was rejected for what appeared to be \"bikes are for poor people\" bias. Gaps in college education, even if well explained, will net you a rejection - pretend you are current and hope they don't check. Basically don't be poor, and don't have been poor at any time.", "Interview Questions": "\"Can you make this commute?\" \"Is the listed salary sufficient?\" \"Can you work this shift?\""}, {"date": "12 Jan 2017", "title": "Student Services Counselor Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Grand Canyon University (Phoenix, AZ) in Dec 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "Phone Interview with HR, then in-person interview with same HR Rep and then a panel interview with three hiring managers for the department.

One of the interviewers was very nice and more open but she kept looking to the other one for what to ask and how to react to my answers. The other one that was in there asked questions did not smile one time and she stared straight ahead at me, almost without blinking. She almost looked angry. It was clearly uncomfortable to myself and to the other manager in the room. At one point she asked me to review my resume and I went over the first job and looked up to see if she had questions or wanted me to continue. She smacked her copy of the resume and said \"I said to go over your entire resume!\".  The way she said it was rude and it was as if she was talking to someone that was way beneath her. It was more of an interrogation interview from her. If she wasn't staring, she was writing, with very big writing. Not one time was there a level of comfort in the room and it was obvious that she intimidated the other manager in the room as well. It was one of the worst interviews I have had. She is a manager only interviewing, not an officer interrogating a criminal, yet that is what it felt like. There is no way she is going to really know a potential employee if interviewees are facing interviewers such as that.
