The first interview was over the phone with a recruiter. The recruiter was very friendly and helpful, however, the next time I heard back from JDC regarding the role was two months later. I had forgotten about the role/company as I got caught up in my current role and suddenly I received an email asking if I remember interviewing with them and if I'm still interested in continuing to the next step. I accepted to continue and had my second interview in person at the location (this was in February). \r\n\r\nAt the second interview, one of the interviewers couldn't make it so she scheduled another video interview a week apart from the second one. After about two weeks from the video interview I was asked to complete a written assignment which consisted of creating an itinerary, creating a powerpoint about the organization, sending a mock email to a potential donor, creating some excel report on budgets, and sending screen shots of multiple entries into Google or Outlook calendar, and one other task. Although the interview process was extremely disorganized until this point,I had already spent so much time with the company  so I decided to do the tasks to see where this was going. \r\n\r\nAfter submitting the tasks, I was invited for another in person interview at the location (this time with three of the higher level executives). I felt good about the interviews and the direction this was going and was convinced this would be my last step in the process. I took the day off of work at my current role and attended the interview which was about 1.5 hours. After the meeting, I was told I would hear a decision by the end of the week. The recruiter then asked me to submit references as they were doing reference checks on all final candidates. I went through and contacted all my references to ask if I could put them down, and then submitted my references. \r\n\r\nA week went by and I didn't receive any information. I asked one of my references if anyone from the organization had contacted her and she told me they didn't. I waited another week and around the last day of the second week I received an email stating that there was another internal candidate that applied and that they would have to explore the possibilities more. I was understanding because of course, things like that can happen and I let them know I'd be willing to wait. \r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later, I received another email from the internal recruiter stating that they MIGHT be closing the role and that they're not sure yet so they will keep me updated in a couple more weeks. I was pretty confused at that point, because I'm not sure how it went from having all these interviews, to another internal candidate applying, to then having the role about to be closed? Like there was no sign of this beforehand? \r\n\r\nAnyway, about two weeks later I received another email stating that they are sure the role would be closed and that they would contact me in the future if anything opens up. \r\n\r\nGot called a few weeks later for a contract/temp role and they asked me to come in to interview again. I really wanted to see where this was going and had nothing to lose so I attended. Funny enough I knew this would happen at the end they emailed me and said they decided to go with another candidate. \r\n\r\nEveryone I met was extremely nice but I feel like the organization really needs to work on its public relations and recruiting practices. I should have known not to go along in their interview process but it was a good lesson for me nonetheless to not allow companies/organization to take advantage.", "Interview Questions": "How do you deal with competing tasks?

Interview tone was very casual and left in a positive manner of offer being extended within next 3 days. 3 days later received a few missed calls from JDC with no voicemails left (unprofessional in my opinion as there were multiple missed calls, not a singular call). Reached out next day to talent acquisition specialist regarding the missed calls and given the typical \"we have gone with another candidate and thank you for you time\" At time of this review, the posting for the position is still listed online which is indicative that A) Specialist was dishonest in saying they had offered another candidate, rather than professional declining due to other issues, or B) Role is actively available to which I'd graciously await a call making an offer after the positive tone and positioning the specialist made at conclusion of interviews that she was beyond excited and prepared to have offer to last of finalists in upcoming days.", "Interview Questions": "What type of management style do you work best under?"}, {"date": "30 Apr 2019", "title": "Director of Marketing Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 months.\u00a0I interviewed at JDC (The Joint) (New York, NY) in Apr 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview process was multi-layered, starting with intro recruiter call, a call with the deputy director + in person with recruiter, and culminated with a 4 hour in-person interview with a 30-60-90 day presentation and discussions with a few team members.
