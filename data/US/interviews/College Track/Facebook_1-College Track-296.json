However, the first outreach emails regarding interviewing lacked detail and to be quite honest, professionalism. The following take-home assignment was disorganized, disconnected, and had broken links. It was framed as a data project but contained absolutely no data to work from or touched on using data in the least. After reaching out about the broken links and being told they weren't needed, which was likely untrue, I attempted the assignment anyway, providing extensive detail and what data points would support the project. If the take-home was any indication of how the team and site were run, then they are in need of some serious attention to detail. I never heard back after completing the assignment, which again is unprofessional considering that I was ton I was one of 7 candidates being considered out of 200+ applicants.
