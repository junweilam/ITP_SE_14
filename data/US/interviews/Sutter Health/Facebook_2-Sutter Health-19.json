Four days later getting an email that the position had been filled but there is a related and similar role, would I be interested? \n\nHmm, role filled in four days is already a red flag but let us see where this goes shall we? \n\nConversation with recruiter went well, and the conversation with the hiring manager. In fact, I really liked the hiring manager \u2013 they said the right things, had a similar perspective on approach and business needs. \n\nNext step was a panel with multiple individuals from their security and privacy teams. A little intimidating, but it provided a good basis for understanding the interactions between and the scope of the teams. \n\nNext was the conversation with the deputy executive in mid-Sepetember, and when things tanked badly. This individual focused on my resume and made the judgement that I was a job hopper, not accepting my explanations or reasoning, and determined I would leave them as well. He then went on about he had been at his last job for ten years and could not understand why some else was not able to do the same, they just had two people leave, and they needed folks to stay there for the long haul. \n\nHonestly, I was dumbfounded as to the logical fallacies and his white male entitlement being used to dismiss my background and experience with his inability and/or unwillingness to grasp how others not as fortunate or advantaged, that are disabled veterans, had to experience a bad employer/toxic work environment, neurodiversity, or just plain unlucky may contribute to a work history. If this indicated how short-sighted, callous, and unprofessional this judgmental executive would be during an interview, how would this carry over when working on their team? No wonder they have people leaving! \n\nThen silence for weeks.\n\nIn the third week of November 2021, I received the canned rejection email from their ATS. The role was reposted to their ATS and the job posting sites the next morning. So they would rather keep searching for the unicorn candidate rather than give someone a chance. \n\nI want to work with true leaders, not judgmental managers who are stuck in their own logical fallacies for years. If this is how they treat candidates, this has me questioning how do they treat you as a patient?

Because, wow, did I have a first impression. \r\n\r\nPhone interview: Scattered and unorganized. Many red flags but decided to take the in person interview, because why not. \r\n\r\nIn person interview: Rude and rushed. They didn't schedule a conference room so the interview was in the lobby, which is loud and is obviously not intended for a 1:1 conversation. The Recruiter answers her phone in the middle of interview and says that she has an appointment and will need to leave early. Thanks for the warning, but, why did you schedule it during this time in the first place if you knew you had to leave? After 30 min of talking, I'm out of the blue ushered to a conference room with two other people. During the interview, it's very apparent that no one has looked at my resume before I arrive. One person I've already had a phone interview with, the other just spoke to me in the lobby, and the third had never met me before. The layout of the interview was awkward because I'm trying to simultaneously catch one person up on who I am while answering the questions. \r\n\r\nSomething that I've taken from my years of recruiting is knowing how to judge an organization based on my candidate experience. For instance, I would never answer my phone in the middle of an interview nor would I have an interview in the middle of a hospital lobby. This signaled to me that 1. My time is not being valued. 2. Things are so disorganized that a conference room couldn't be scheduled ahead of time. \r\n\r\nSo yes, in the end, I didn't move forward in the process. Was I sad? Not in the least.

Interesting enough, in December the ICU wanted me to take a travel assignment based off of my resume alone; not even an interview needed. Unfortunately they pulled the contract altogether before I could accept it. Then in February I applied for 3 of their night FT positions and received a call from their recruiter, who asked me random personality based questions and then setup an interview for me in the ICU. \r\n\r\nAt the last minute I received a text message from the \"ICU interviewer\" stating she needs to reschedule, so I did and met at her office in the ICU. The interview was not very formal and it really just went over my resume and previous work that I had not listed (i.e. non RN, but pt care roles), but no real in depth scenario or knowledge based questions. She did mention that she had some new nurses on nights. She said she would speak to my references and get back to me and told me to email her if I had any questions. I did email with some questions while thanking her for the interview. However her reply did not bother addressing my inquiries and just said I don\u2019t have enough experience although my resume states otherwise and they wanted my travel contract in December based on my resume alone. \r\n\r\nSo over the last 4 months there have been openings and recently 5 ICU night positions. It appears the Staff turnaround is high there and most likely need staff more than the staff needs them. I applied and a month later I get a call from the same \"ICU interviewer,\" who had no idea she had talked to me before. We setup an interview and I met with her in her office again. \r\n\r\nShe recognized me, she inquired, and I told her she didn\u2019t hire me. She asked why and when I began to state the above someone barged in the office asking questions about an ER admit, getting a patient out, etc., etc. The person left and the \"interviewer\" apologized while holding her phone and text messaging, which went on for the majority of the interview. Again, no knowledge or scenario based questions.\r\n\r\nThe first request was to tell her about myself. As I went on from the beginning of my hospital career 8yrs ago and discussed my different roles and experience at each job, she interjected and wanted to know about my time in ICU. Most of my time as a nurse had been step-down ICU until now where it\u2019s been mostly ICU.\r\n\r\nI am currently on a travel contract at a nearby facility in the ICU and she concluded that it\u2019s not an adequate ICU although I stated that I take vented patients on ICU drips. She asked about my preceptors back home and said she would need to speak with them because  there has been too much of a gap between when I worked back home until now (6mo) and I basically don\u2019t have my skills current. That was not an issue in February, but apparently it is now. She also mentioned that she has 5 brand new graduate nurses and needs someone with experience. So basically, they can\u2019t keep staff, so they hire nurses with zero experience, but won\u2019t hire nurses with 8yrs bedside care, 4yrs RN (2yrs as step-down ICU, 2+yrs ICU) experience. \r\n\r\nI stated that back in FL, the work experience is exponential without the unions or patient ratios to protect nurses. Medical staff are put to the test every single day back home. While text messaging,  she just said she would need my references and gave me her card, so that I could email them to her. \r\n\r\nI emailed my references to her the next day, my references were waiting for a phone call, but the next morning I received an email again saying I don\u2019t have enough experience. My references were never contacted. I replied back to the email questions that decision and the rationale for everything stated above, not expecting a job, but wanting a logical reason for such inconsistent reasons and telling me one thing, while not giving me a professional interview, and doing something else entirely.\r\n\r\nNot a good representation of what I thought would be a great place to work. Obviously they need to fill ICU positions regularly. It seems they need staff more than the staff needs them as reflected by the multiple job listings. I considered staying in CA and making Santa Rosa my home, coming back to my home state of CA. It would take a lot now to make me reconsider that. It\u2019s their loss. \r\n\r\nThe only reason the interview was difficult is because of the lack of professionalism on her mobile phone and not really giving undivided attention, and not following through with what she said she would do. If I got the job, the interview would have been simple because no challenging questions were asked. They would rather hire people with zero experience, who will most likely make many mistakes rather than hire someone with 2yrs experience, which is not enough experience. However that makes sense, I will never know. It\u2019s probably not a facility I would feel comfortable trusting or working with.", "Interview Questions": "I was not asked any real questions to determine my knowledge, critical thinking, skill set, or anything that all other managers ask at other hospitals.

My technical skills were explained and he thoroughly enjoyed my background on various items.  He informed me that a further one-on-one interview would be necessary with a panel of technical folks.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the one-on-one interview I arrived at the location on time.  I was escorted and taken to a conference room where there was a panel of people with various technical expertises from Web Developers, Production Support, Managers and Engineers.  Most of the panel were men along with only one female.  Various questions were asked from windows IIS servers, Weblogic, Database and Linux/Unix.  I felt confident about my answers.  At the end of the first round, I was taken to another waiting area and was asked to wait around 15 minutes for them to decide if I made it to the second round.\r\n\r\nAfter 15 minutes, the hiring manager came to escort me out of the building, he proceeded to explain that I didn\u2019t qualify for the position because I didn\u2019t have enough Windows 2008 Server experience along with IIS 7 which I found it almost laughable since his staff learned the technology four months before my interview.  Usually my experience on Unix/Linux is a demonstration that I can learn just about any operating system but that was not the case here.  Windows trumped Unix?  When has anyone seen that before?    The hiring manager seemed very heart broken that his staff of technical folks didn\u2019t want to proceed with a second interview which lead me to believe that something else was at work.  To be told that I was not technical enough because I didn\u2019t know one piece of a technology is a flat out lie and that leads me to believe they were making an excuse.\r\n\r\nI got the impression that this is a Good O Boys shop.  There was only one woman in the interview panel which was a Manager and I didn\u2019t see many women working in the Information Technology building.  I\u2019ve never heard of a job that requires people to know exactly every piece of Technology and not be given an opportunity to learn new items on the job.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "24 Aug 2015", "title": "Director Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Sutter Health (Sacramento, CA) in Mar 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "There was a phone interview, several in-person interviews and two panel interviews followed by a personality type test and a drug test.

They had my resume for about 4 months before they called.  Started with a phone interview with the hiring manager.  That went well so I was invited for a 1:1 interview.  That also went well and I had good rapport with the hiring manager.  He asked me to appear for a panel interview which got a bit riduculous.  There were 6 people present in the room and three others attended from another office location via teleconference.  Nine people...barely enough time for each person to ask one question, and I never knew where the next question was coming from.  I felt like I was being vetted for the supreme court.  This was for an upper level analytical position; individual contributor...not even a manager or director.  I felt it was overkill.  Furthermore, I didn't have good rapport with some of the folks in the room.  Manager called a few days later and offered me the job.  I was surprised...didn't think the panel had gone well, but boss obviously liked me well enough to (perhaps) overrule them.  Since no one from the team I would be working with directly was part of the panel, and since I was on the fence (liked the boss but maybe not the larger group) about the position, I asked to be able to meet with the team I'd be working with to help make up my mind.  Not sure what the boss told them; again, I had already been offered the job.  They put me in another panel with the team (three of them vs. me...and it was \"versus\") and the team grilled me hard.  I wanted to laugh and say, 'you guys know that I've been offered the job and I'm trying to decide, right?'\r\n\r\nI ended up accepting the offer after making some demands and it worked out fine, although I was right about some of the folks on the panel.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about a time you were asked to present unpopular data/findings; how you did it; what the outcome was; what you would do differently; etc."}, {"date": "27 Aug 2010", "title": "Senior Project Planning Specialist Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Sutter Health (Sacramento, CA) in Aug 2010", "Interview Descriptions": "A few days after applying online I received an email requesting a phone screening interview.
