Following that, I was called in for a first-round 1+ hour panel interview on-campus.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, there seemed to be some confusion as to my application materials and the interviewers seemed to have trouble getting organized. The interview started 25 minutes late and hence ran over the hour slot by about 30 minutes. After a week, I was contacted by phone by the hiring manager who proceeded to point out various gaps and perceived flaws in my resume as it related to the position I interviewed for and then asked if I would be interested in applying for a position in the same office that was of a lesser status and would pay 10k+ less than the position I had applied for. I expressed that it would be hard for me to rationalize taking a role that was so beneath my target salary.\r\n\r\nDespite being told multiple times that I would hear back in the coming weeks regarding my candidacy, I never received a follow-up message to let me know that I wasn't actually being considered or that the position closed and they went with someone else. I finally wrote to the original HR representative that I spoke with for an update, and over a week and a half since that email, still have heard nothing.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most unprofessional hiring processes I've ever been subjected to, but considering the comments that I heard during the interview implying that the institution is going through a lot of big changes and that not everyone is happy about the changes, I suppose I probably dodged a bullet in coming to work for this university.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you interested in working for the University of La Verne?\r\nTell us about your background and why your experience relates to this position?"}, {"date": "10 Mar 2021", "title": "Events Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0I interviewed at University of La Verne (La Verne, CA) in Jan 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "Easy, was interviewed by the head Supervisor as well as several of the students leads.
