The person on the phone seemed to approve the answers because they told me that they would call me back for the background/drug testing information. It took a month before I did the initiative and contacted first to ask what happened to the information that was going to be sent to get started. I could only say that it became a cycle of repeats for the last 3 months. I in the end did not contact back again due to the unprofessionalism of communications. I checked back to see if the position was still there on the website, it wasn't.

I am not a huge fan of sales, but would be working hands on with new clients and I was given the opportunity to help a lot of people make that first step in recovery.  The pay was a big pay cut from the job that I was currently working but, being so passionate in helping others, I took a leap of faith that I could make it work.
