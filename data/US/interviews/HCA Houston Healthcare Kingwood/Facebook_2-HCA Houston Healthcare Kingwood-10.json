Other candidates that were called included a few current employees, which made me feel a bit like the decision may have already been made prior to showing up. There were 10 spots available and various locations and only about 7 people (including myself) showed up for the interview. The director and manager of patient services did an overview of the company and job description. They also expressed how they wanted to change the image of the facility but discovered the only way for that to become possible was to change the people who work there (not in those exact words). The director did most of the talking while the manager barely looked up at anyone. The environment was pretty relaxing and not intimidating at all. After the review of the company was completed the two divided the resumes amongst each other and did two interviews at a time. I was interviewed at the same time as a current employee, but her resume was taken by the director and mine by the manager. I thought the interview went really well. My answers were on point and sincere but at the end she basically made it clear that I wasn't going to be called. I thanked her for the interview and said I looked forward to hearing from them and she responded with \"uh, well....I don't know\". I pretty much knew I wasn't going to get called even after sending a follow up email and calling both parties, which none of my attempts were successful. I was really hoping to be picked considering I have two degrees in healthcare administration and business, but I lack actual experience in a healthcare facility.", "Interview Questions": "Basic interview questions asked to identify personality, work, and ethical traits.
