It is much closer to the Montefiore campus than the Yonkers station. No one will tell you this when they send you your interview confirmation.\r\n\u2022\tUber is available to and from the train. No need to walk up to the closest street \u2013 they will come down to the train.\r\n\u2022\tIf you are tempted to put your jacket and interview shoes on in the taxi don\u2019t do it! It\u2019s a windy, twisty road and you will just get knocked around in the cab.\r\n\u2022\tAnd seriously, unless you\u2019re interviewing for the role of CEO or Comptroller, don\u2019t even bother wearing a suit or nice shoes.\r\n\u2022\tIn any case, there is a lovely Starwood Hotel right next to the complex, where they will offer you free coffee, tea, water, comfy seats, and a nice rest room to change in. Take advantage of this!\r\n\u2022\tThe Montefiore HR person will likely tell you that you are interviewing at 200 Corporate Road. This is not quite right, and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll be waiting there for a while until someone directs you to a building on the other side of the complex (I think it\u2019s #175).\r\n\u2022\tWhen you finally get to your destination, there will be no one there to greet you. Why do they have the interviews in Yonkers? Couldn\u2019t they do the interviews in the Bronx?? In any case, if you\u2019re lucky, someone will be exiting the building and will let you in. \r\n\u2022\tYou might be tempted, at this point, to get a drink of water from the \u201cwaiting area\u201d \u2013 don\u2019t bother \u2013 there are no cups there. You might also be tempted to ask to use a rest room, but again, there won\u2019t be anyone there to greet you to let you in, so there is no one to ask. Ideally, you have had your water and used the restroom at the Starwood Suites (I can\u2019t recommend them highly enough there!)\r\n\u2022\tIf you\u2019re waiting a long time without anyone coming to greet you, and believe me you will be, you might be tempted to try to contact your HR rep. Again, don\u2019t bother. She won\u2019t answer the phone and then will just send you a snarky note to tell you that she knows you\u2019re there.\r\n\u2022\tAnother nice person might at this point notice you\u2019ve been sitting there a long time and offer to show you where the interview conference room is. I don\u2019t know if this is necessary, but I took the opportunity to wait in the conference room. My interviewers finally came in about 10 minutes late, dressed super-casually, I might add. I felt like a moron for dressing up for the interview. Lesson learned, I guess.\r\n\u2022\tMy interviewees would be my managers and seemed uncomfortable with the process. Why not have an HR person there if you are holding interviews at the HR headquarters??? Anyway, cookie-cutter questions: Why you? Why Maimonides? What was your hardest case last year? Snooze\u2026 After 35 minutes the interview was over. \r\n\u2022\tNow, if you\u2019re like me, and have to take a day off of work to take the Metro-North ($16.50) up to Yonkers for an interview and pay for an Uber back and forth ($16) from the train, you might want to determine beforehand if this job is a really good fit for you before making this journey. Another lesson learned, I guess? I\u2019m not sure.\r\n\u2022\tHaving some time to kill after the interview, I went back to Starwood Suites to change my clothes, get another (FREE!) cup of coffee and sit in a comfy chair in blessed air conditioning. The ladies room there has a HUGE garbage bin which was handy for me to toss all the paperwork I had brought with me to make sure I had done ample research on the company. \r\n\u2022\tSeriously, the best part of that day was the time I spent in the Starwood Suite lobby. They were super-awesome there. I should check to see if they need any social workers\u2026", "Interview Questions": "cookie-cutter questions: Why you? Why Maimonides?

They tell you that this position can lead to great things, but the one thing they leave out which is a VERY BIG THING is that it can take up to seven years to get promoted or even change positions if you don't know someone internally.  Any who....the interviewer ask your basic interview questions as well as verifies your work history and why you would like to work for Montefiore.  If you make it through interview one, you receive a call and they ask you to report to a Yonkers, NY location to fill out a massive amount of paperwork including payroll before you officially are hired.  You speak with an HR rep who basically details you on the position and feeds you the same crap they first interviewer feeds you then gives you an orientation date and a schedule of things you have to complete before the orientation which includes drug screening and a TVB shot in which you have to schedule at one of their locations and you have to get the shot one day then wait a few days and go back for the results.  If the results come back negative the doctor will sign off on it and all the paperwork you received on the interview journey you have to take with you to orientation on the date given at the given location to be stamped and that ends the interview process.  My advise to anyone seeking this position....MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CRYSTAL CLEAR BACKGROUND!  They will use even the smallest thing against you even if it happened ten years prior to your interview with no felony attached.", "Interview Questions": "What can you offer Montefiore?"}, {"date": "3 Feb 2018", "title": "General Surgeon Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0The process took 5 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Montefiore Medical (Bronx, NY) in May 2014", "Interview Descriptions": "The guy interviewed me.
