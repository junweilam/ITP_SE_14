Internal candidates will be interviewed by a couple of team members for fit and function. Typically, everyone knows each other already so these are more or less an extension of a conversation that already started prior to the internal position being posted. In other words, the hiring manager will usually have someone in mind. \r\n\r\nExternal is always done through HR - there is a vetting process and typically a short interview with the HR resources to ensure you meet the minimal qualifications. At this point your resume will be forwarded on to the hiring manager who will then float it to their senior people for response. In some instances the hiring manager will reach out for a phone call but most often this is delegated to members of the team. Sometimes this will be conversational but it could also be the dreaded behavioral analysis interview - 'tell us about a time where you failed at something'...... blah blah blah. This is painful for everyone involved so just know that it is an HR requirement. We didn't choose to go that route. \r\n\r\nOnce you make it past the behavioral then there will be a broader interview with other members of the team. Questions will be focused on your fit for the role and also for your interactions with other members of the team. In short, you need to know your stuff and fit with the culture of the team. You may be asked to come in a couple of times and you should know ahead of time that this process drags on much longer than it should. \r\n\r\nIf you make it past those rounds then HR will authorize the hiring manager to make an offer. Again, this usually takes longer than it should so you might have to wait awhile.

Out of the blue though, in July of 2014 HR emailed me and asked if I would be available to do a phone interview. I gave her a time and she called me the next day. It literally took about 15-20 minutes, which was short from previous phone interviews I have done. She emailed me a few days later and recommended me to the head nurse in the dempartment the position was for. The head nurse emailed me and I believe we talked on the phone to set up an in person interview. The face to face interview literally took only 20 minutes, which did make me nervous. Other than that though it seemed to go extremely well. The basic interview questions were asked. Be prepared to be asked what your long term goals are and where you see yourself in 5 or 10 years. Have your answers ready before the interview. You want to come off as confident. Then, 5 days later(due to the holiday and what not) HR called me and offered me the position.
