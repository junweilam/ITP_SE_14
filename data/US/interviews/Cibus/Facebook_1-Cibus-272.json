We set up a telephone call and he indicated he would like to fly me out to San Diego for an on-site interview.  That interview happened about a month after our initial phone call.  It was about 3 weeks before I heard anything back, but I did eventually get an offer.  I was a little disappointed in the fact that I had given them my current salary ahead of the on-site interview, so I assumed the offer would be competitive to what I was making.  San Diego's cost of living was almost 40% higher than my current location, so I mentioned that was something I was concerned about.  In the end, I had a great interview experience.  The people were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  I think the company is doing really cool work, but based on the cost of living, compensation and benefits package it wasn't an offer I was in a position to accept.  I understand as a small company they aren't willing to pay what the big corporations do, but I wish that would have been communicated more directly before the on-site interview.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about your leadership style.\r\nWhy do you want to work for Cibus?"}, {"date": "4 Aug 2015", "title": "Research Associate Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Cibus (San Diego, CA) in Jan 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "First they send me an email to set up a phone interview.
