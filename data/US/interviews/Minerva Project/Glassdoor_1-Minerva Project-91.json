I spent about 5-6 hours on the coding exercise, submitted it and after a few days, they contacted me to set up a series of 4 one hour video interviews. The video interviews covered making an addition to the take home exercise, a system design discussion about a full stack architecture, live coding an algorithm in JavaScript, and a final interview back with the hiring manager for culture fit and any other questions. A few days after the final interview, I received a form rejection email from the hiring manager. I followed up with the hiring manager for additional feedback with no response. My impression of this interview is negative, because throughout the process, they seemed very interested in me and at certain points encouraged me to move forward in the process, wherein I spent 10 hours of my time even prioritizing it over other opportunities, and after receiving a form rejection email, they wouldn't follow up with additional feedback.

I hadn't been sure about this job when I made the initial contact, but talking to the various people, I realised this was a group I really wanted to work with. I had spent several years working on an open-source project, so I didn't need to do any coding task, instead I wrote a short technical overview of the project and made a little demo video which I shared, and I was then invited to give a technical talk based on this project to all the engineers.\r\n\r\nThey made an offer very quickly, and we sent a few emails back and forth to clarify conditions, benefits etc. I think it only took about 2.5 weeks from I started the process, until I had signed.", "Interview Questions": "What is one technical challenge/accomplishment that you can tell me about?"}, {"date": "2 Feb 2019", "title": "Senior Marketing Manager Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 8 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Minerva Project (San Francisco, CA) in Dec 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "I sent in my cover letter and resume and week or so later I was Bcc'd on an email asking to schedule a phone interview.

The interviewer said \"like\" so much I started counting (17 times in the last 10 minutes of the phone call alone). The interviewer was clear about not knowing for sure what they were seeking. I was asked to perform a simple assignment and not spend too much time on it, and I sent that in a few days later. After 3+ weeks I hadn't heard anything, so I sent a follow up. Heard nothing back from that. Another 2.5 weeks after my first follow up I sent another, which triggered an automated \"thanks, but no thanks\" email.
