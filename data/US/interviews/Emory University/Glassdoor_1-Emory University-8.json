It is hard to decipher if you are a good fit by how chill they are. With this being sad stand out. Bring extra copies of your resume. Have a business notepad. Take notes, ask MANY questions.

I applied for the position in early July. I was contacted for a phone interview in the first week of August. The next week I was called to schedule an in person interview. \r\n\r\nThe on site interview took place in mid-August. After introducing myself to the administrative assistant, I was almost immediately greeted by the current program coordinator and then the process began. I had 3 back to back 1 on 1 Interviews. The process lasted about an hour and a half to two hours and was completely seamless and well planned. I interviewed with the current Program Coordinator for about 30 minutes, then the individual who would manage me for an additional 30 minutes, and finally the Director for about 45 minutes. This was much less overwhelming than a panel would\u2019ve been. I thoroughly enjoyed speaking with each interviewer, and found myself wishing I could spend more time with them after it was over. This was not a basic interview, where experience and ability were the only thing taken into account. All of the interviewers were very interested in my education, skill set, personality, and ability to work with a team.\r\n\r\n I was informed that I was the top candidate at the end of the same week as my onsite interview. I received a verbal offer at the beginning of the next week, and then received a final written offer a few days later. Overall the entire process from application to start date lasted about 2 months.
