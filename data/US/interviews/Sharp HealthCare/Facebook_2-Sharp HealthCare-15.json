I thought call was fine - recruiter was informative and nice, but I was asked somewhat obvious, redundant questions like: \n\n-What is your clinical and non-clinical recruiting experience? (This question obviously did not bother me because its standard, but I was asked to elaborate on aforementioned non-clinical roles as if there was something novel about recruiting for regular corporate positions\u2026)\n-How many years have you worked remotely? (The whole recruiting team is remote but they make it sound like if you are new to WFH you may have challenges)\n\nThis was a Limited Tenure AKA Temp position, but comes with Full Benefits.  I thought target salary didnt match with what they were looking for. I thought my expectations matched my experience + Southern CA cost of living, but recruiter said theres folks who have been longer with the team making less. Thats off-putting  because 1) That doesnt mean much when overall work experience should be considered 2) Although FTE benefits are included it doesnt make up for the fact this is a *3 month position\n \n\n*JD and recruiter didnt say exactly how long the tenure was except for the summer so assuming only 3 months only. Also there was no promise of conversion. What a red flag was is that they opened this position to cover FTEs who go on PTO, get sick, etc. That insinuates the current team cannot handle covering for their peers or recruiters are expected to constantly be working on reqs.\n\nRecruiter said I would be scheduled for next round interviews, but I heard nothing back. I would honestly give a negative rating experience solely based that. I appreciate a generic negative rejection that I\u2019m assuming they try to give their own candidates. \n\nMy advice to other candidates: focus on your clinical experience. I responded to the \u201cWhats the most difficult role you\u2019ve recruited for?\u201d with a technical related role. Just answer with a clinical/provider role. Also dont share salary expectations because I think they have many applicants and have to weed some out that say they are \u201cflexible.\u201d", "Interview Questions": "Whats the most difficult role youve recruited for?"}, {"date": "10 May 2023", "title": "Team Lead RN Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Sharp HealthCare (San Diego, CA)", "Interview Descriptions": "5-panel interview, standard questions, scenario based\u2026hiring manager, MA, LVN, RN, RN supervisor, office manager.
