I had to contact HR repeatedly to get an answer out of them - which ultimately was 'sorry, the email was in my drafts box'. I asked for feedback and was told twice 'we are going in another direction'. This was overall an extremely negative experience. I was told they 'hadn't found a good fit' for 6 months. Not surprising. No-one seemed to know what this job was for or how it would work. The panel interview did not include the hiring manager ('too busy') and was almost entirely behavioral questions, leaving little time for me to talk about my experience and expertise or ask questions of my own. The hiring manager did not seem to have read my application and decided despite my significant international experience in one health that I had 'not been working in conservation' and I 'wouldn't understand the language'. Good grief. I found it patronizing, added to by having to repeatedly ask HR what was going on after being ghosted afterwards. I was told the decision would be in a few days. Interviews by fellow veterinarians do not need to be insulting. They are going in another direction - me too, as far in the opposite direction as possible.

She also apologized and said this isn't a good time of day for her because she gets sleepy in the afternoon.

The HR interview had much more to do with the overall work environment and benefits at WCS and with answering more generic questions about my viability as a candidate. Then I went to interview with my potential boss and he explained the aspirations of the education department, what they've been doing in the past and how they've updated their offerings, and their plans for online and other education. He described the daily work,who my reporting staff would be, and the office atmosphere. He asked me about my experiences developing environmental education and teacher training programs. it was not very unusual, no questions about where I want to be in 5 years or what sort of vegetable I would be if I were a vegetable.
