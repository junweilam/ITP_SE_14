I wanted the full time day shift job, but due to the union, they can't offer full time day shift job.\n Some people told me it may take 3 months or longer. They don't give you any timeline. \n\nI did everything, like background check, health exams, and so on. (took around 1 month)\n\n\nAfter that, went to the HR and signed the paper. They said wage was not determined so I had to wait.  I have around 10 years of experience but some were in my home country. HR said they would give you credit for the experience so my wage would be determined by all of my experience. \n\nAfter signed the paper, I have never got any email or contact from HR for 3 months.  \n\n\nAlmost after 4 months, I emailed/ called HR to get an update. \n\nBecause the person who was working on my job application quit, everything was stopped from that moment. After call and email, within 2 weeks I received the real orientation dates which was 3 business days later. \n\n\nThe worst part is that the wage. \n\nThey offered me the wage for the new graduate which is $37/h (no over time after 8 hrs, $37 for 12 hrs. )\n\n\nI waited 4 months for nothing. I am still waiting for the response from supervisor. Never replies. \n\n\nThere are reason why there are so many people quit.
