I moved onto the next phase which was a video interview.  It was originally scheduled at a certain time then the interviewer emailed me directly  that the time was now 15 mins later, no big deal. I joined 5 mins before it started and waited 10 mins after the meeting start time and the interviewer never joined. I let the recruiter know and she called me an hour later to let me know the interviewer had an emergency  and can join right now. Luckily I was still home so I agreed and joined. The interview was only supposed to go for 30 mins and it went almost an hour! We had just a great conversation and it felt very comfortable.\n\nI was then asked to come in for an in-person interview with the video interviewer and the rest of the team. This interview ended up going on for an hour and a half! I loved getting to know the other team members and the conversation was natural and we were laughing having a great time! They even showed me around the office and if I got the position, my office. If they would\u2019ve given me an offer that day or that week I would\u2019ve accepted.\n\nThe in-person interview was Monday late afternoon. By Wednesday that week, the recruiter reached out with some additional questions from them which I thought I answered during both the video and in-person, so I answered it to her to relay. I was then asked to submit references that same day. \n\nBy Friday, I was told I was a strong candidate, but they had an internal referral they had to interview and they were going to make a decision/offer on Tuesday. Tuesday rolls around and I don\u2019t hear anything. I did reach out to the recruiter that evening asking for an update. The following day, the recruiter said she got in touch and the internal referral interview got delayed and for me to \u201chang in there just one more day\u201d and an answer would be made by Thursday. The recruiter messaged me on Thursday late afternoon stating she hasn\u2019t gotten a hold of them to get an update. The recruiter essentially was ghosted and she couldn\u2019t get a hold of anyone.\n\n2 weeks go by and the recruiter finally got an update, the person who left which made the position available came back and they gave her the job back. I completely understand that happens, but I thought it was completely unprofessional how the latter part of the process was handled by them. \n\nThe recruiter was AMAZING throughout the process. She would touch base with me and let me know that she reached out etc.", "Interview Questions": "What made you want to leave your current position?"}, {"date": "19 Jan 2021", "title": "Direct Support Professional (DSP) Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Pioneer Center for Human Services (Nashm\u012b \u2018Afr\u012b)", "Interview Descriptions": "Very nice and essential blah blah bland not too good with a lot of the food that you have had a good time to try the new food with the same price as a little too expensive and not a lot to try to make a lot more money and food", "Interview Questions": "For sure if that would happen?"}, {"date": "28 Feb 2020", "title": "Peer Support Specialist Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Pioneer Center for Human Services (Marysville, WA) in Feb 2020", "Interview Descriptions": "One on one and was laid back and informative.
