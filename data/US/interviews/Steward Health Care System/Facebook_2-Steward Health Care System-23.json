However, when reaching out to my references the Human Resources woman had difficulty contacting one of my employers due to it being an at home call center position. From that point on it was a complete headache. She asked for a reference to confirm my employment at a place she was having issues reaching, after a week I was able to get in touch with one of my old supervisors who was willing to speak with her. She called him & claimed he had told her he\u2019d only known me for 6 months, which was bogus because he had been my supervisor the last year I had worked there & had no reason to lie about it.  She then asked for my tax returns for the past 3 years, which would have been fine had I not been in the middle of a move & was unable to locate them. I went ahead & withdrew my application due to her refusing to move forward until I was able to find them. It was too much work for the amount of pay they were offering & the hours weren\u2019t that great either. I turned down two job offers at different places that were paying higher because I wanted to work in a hospital environment due to me going to nursing school just for her to make it as difficult as possible for me to have the job. \r\n\r\nShe also kept referring to my call center history as \u2018secretarial work\u2019.
