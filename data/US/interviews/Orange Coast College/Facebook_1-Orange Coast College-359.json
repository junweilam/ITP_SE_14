It was a long wait and process. I arrived 15 minutes before the interview and was given the interview questions to go over. Then I entered a room with a panel of 3 interviewers. There were 11 questions in total. While I answered questions, I only saw the tops of their heads because they were busy writing down notes. The only time that I looked at each person in the eye was during the end when I was able to ask questions. I guess the first interview heavily focuses on your answers and not your personality.  If you get a second interview, then I am assuming it will be more personable.  I was notified within 2 hours with a rejection email which tells me that they probably hired within the department because it was just too quick.
