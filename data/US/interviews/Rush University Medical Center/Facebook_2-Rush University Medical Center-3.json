I applied for an RN position, got an interview to meet with the a manager (in-person), and now it\u2019s interview day. Okay, cool. I get there, check in, wait for the nurse manager to interview me. I greet and introduce myself, but can\u2019t help feel like I\u2019ve been immediately dismissed. Maybe I wasn\u2019t what she was expected, maybe I don\u2019t look like what she thought I would, maybe it\u2019s my age, or maybe she just doesn\u2019t care enough about this interview. As we\u2019re interviewing/conversing, she gives me the most disinterested attitude as I ask questions. She tells me she will be right back as she had to go talk to a doctor that\u2019s quitting. Erm, okay. She takes 15 minutes. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I should\u2019ve just left because it was such a waste of time. She comes back and asks the same questions she already did (likely wasn\u2019t paying attention the first time around). Then she asks if I\u2019d be willing to talk to some of the other nurses. The nurses are much more personable, nice, and engaging. I felt a click with them. After we peer interview, the nurse manager and I finish the interview. She tells me \u201cto be on the look out\u201d. I smile, thank her for her time and consideration, and I\u2019m escorted back out as the interview is over. I don\u2019t know. Everything felt negative. I\u2019ve never had an interview conducted in such an unprofessional way and by someone so disinterested in the entire process. I wasn\u2019t offered a position, but I did of course send a thank you e-mail to the manager and the recruiter. I later asked for feedback but never got a response. Overall a poor experience. It\u2019s been about six months since then, but I what made me think of Rush and this horrible experience was their HR department.
