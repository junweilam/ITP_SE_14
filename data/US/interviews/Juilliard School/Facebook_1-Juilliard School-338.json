Great vibe, really positive experience. There was no HR involvement which I think really slowed down the process because the direct report was too bogged down with their job responsibilities to keep the hiring process moving along. I was then left on read with absolutely no updates for about two months. I followed up multiple times and received either a wishy washy response or no response at all.
