She knows a former co-worker who drove me to quit my last job because she was a nightmare to work with. So the manager was trying to provoke me into saying negative things and insulting me. It was obvious because of how sarcastic she became half-way through the interview, even to the point of insulting my intelligence. She was pretty much being a witch. \r\n\r\nWhen I asked why the person who presently holds the job is leaving, she got defensive and her tone became rude. She said she needed to change her hours because she has kids and the new position was a higher salary so she had a good reason to vacate. Hmm, based on the 10 minute interaction I had with this manager, I highly doubt that's really why she's leaving. After putting me through the ringer and insults, she suddenly says she thinks I will be bored with the job and I'll probably get tired of it so that was a concern for her. At no time did I say anything to warrant that statement and I told her I didn't feel that would be the case at all. Then she asked, even though I've been out of work for some time, if I got the job, did I need to give anyone notice - like say my husband, if I needed to check with him. Gee, maybe if I was from her generation, you know, where Fred Flintstone resides.\r\n\r\nI was told by the manager she and her asst. would make a decision by the next day because she was going on vacation for two weeks.
