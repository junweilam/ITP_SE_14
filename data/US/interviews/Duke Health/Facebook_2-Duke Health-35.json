Despite applying in November, I didn't receive initial feedback until three months later, and the entire process took a total of almost four months. About two months into waiting for any response, I was scheduled for my first interview (virtual), however while I was awaiting that scheduled interview, I received an automated email saying that I was no longer being considered for the role. After following up with Performance Services directly and informing them that the online portal indicated my removal from the candidate pool, they informed me that I WAS still being considered... This disorganization was both frustrating and unsettling, especially for an organization in charge of implementing \"operational improvements\" across Duke Health. I then had a virtual interview with a panel, followed by an on-site interview with three groups of two interviewers a few weeks later. All of the questions were behavioral and easy. During the on-site, the first two pairs of interviewers asked me the same questions, which was bizarre... After what I thought was a strong interview and very strong academic and professional background that directly satisfied the job posting's qualifications, I was informed about a week later that I had not been offered the job. What was most upsetting was the reason given in the email -- citing that they want candidates from Industrial and Systems Engineering Backgrounds. And this was after I was told repeatedly that no prior healthcare or systems knowledge was needed, and that they had a mentorship/education program to teach new hires anything they needed to succeed. Considering that during this entire time my resume very clearly spelled out my academic/professional history, this information about a poor fit should have been shared with me way way earlier, instead of stringing me along for four months. Overall, I feel it was a poor interview experience.
