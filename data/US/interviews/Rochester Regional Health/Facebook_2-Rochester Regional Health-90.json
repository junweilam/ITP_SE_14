I looked at it as positive but immediately went back to Glassdoor to see if I could gain more insight. I was skeptical after receiving a call so quickly and also saw that there were no applicants event after the position had been open for more than a month.\n\nI had a phone screening with the recruiter and all went well until the topic switched to salary expectations. The recruiter talked up Rochester and RRH and how family-oriented the environment is (red-flag: usually means you're getting paid a \"competitive salary\" or a lot worse and supplemented with cheap pizza and gift cards). I had heard such but had also heard how rough Rochester and working for RRH can be. The recruiter talked more about the city than anything but also talked about how RRH is expanding its flow cytometry. I know everyone is trying to do this right now for NGS and cancer research. So, it was a red flag for me (profit and gov't subsidies to make more profit almost none of which gets to the staff in a significant portion). I was also told I'd be on the bench for a while before having an actual staff, which I was okay with to start but I started to get a feeling that I would be walking into a do-more-with-less situation, meaning that although they were currently looking for manager, they were probably more in need of a director or above (I would be able to fill those rolls too).  But trying to save on salary costs by hiring a manager, creating profits for RRH and the executives. Because that's what hospitals and labs do :). Expansion, mergers and acquisitions means that we're not growing. So, buy up competition and keep bringing in profits. It's always weird to me to get this feeling in a healthcare environment. But I was starting to get the feeling that staff reviews were going to be confirmed soon. \n\nRecruiter asked the usual questions (tell me about yourself, why are you applying for this role etc.) Then as usual with hospitals and lab related companies, rather than being upfront about salary range, I was asked about my expectations (another red flag). Unwilling to give this information, we moved on to some other questions, including more detailed ones that were more for the hiring manager. There were a few more questions and cordials, including questions about NYC certifications for med techs/ CLSs. I already knew the criteria but I was asked how quickly I could obtain the certifications. I said I'd have to get back but knew from previous research processing alone is 1-3 months.\n\nI received an email the next day from the recruiter with info about the certification process for NYC testing. I then responded stating time frames and asked more questions. GHOSTED at this point only to receive a generic message 3 weeks later that they were looking at different candidates.\n\nI say all this because this has been happening a lot lately and unnecessarily so. Commnication is key yet there's very little. Transparency is expected on the end of the employee yet silence from the employers. I've read about RRH from Glassdoor and this interview just confirmed it. It's a scam hospital system as usual. Hospital execs make profit. Leave the staff and patients in bad situations and move on to \"create value\" for other companies. It's really sad.\n\nIf you can avoid this place, please do. If you need a job, do it and keep in mind that your goal is to find better. So do something towards that and get away from this \"family-oriented\" city called Rochester and RRH.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about yourself?\nAre you certified in NYC as med tech/CLS?\nDo you know anything about Rochester/RRH?\nWhat are your salary expectations?\n"}, {"date": "26 Jan 2022", "title": "Customer Service Billing Representative Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Rochester Regional Health (Rochester, NY) in Nov 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "Simple.
