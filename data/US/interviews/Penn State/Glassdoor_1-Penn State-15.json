It would have lasted 30 mins, but I interviewed them for 15 mins as I wanted to make sure it was a good fit. In this interview, they were unable to state if the position would allow for work-life balance. Simply saying the work was rewarding. \n\nI then got a phone call from HR from the main campus (state college) inviting me to a final interview (a campus visit) and asking about salary expectations. I requested their range as regional campuses tend to be lower salaries; their range was 35-50K depending on education and experience. With the qualifications and education I have, I asked for 48-50. \n\nBefore the campus visit, I got an itinerary with some significant errors, including the wrong date. I got to campus and was rushed through many meetings. The campus tour was disorganized. During the campus visit, they expressed the hours would be exhaustive. 8:30-5:30 ish with some nights; this clarified why they answered my work-life balance question the way they did.\n\nI will say a good thing was the campus visit travel was reimbursed as well as lunch; this is a standard higher education practice that does not include those who may be low SES; from a Diversity Equity and Inclusion stance, this is an issue. \n\nBased on the projected start date, I was supposed to hear if I got an offer within a week. I was ghosted for two weeks instead of getting any email, even one that said we are still working on the process. I had sent two emails the Monday after I was to hear, and then a week and a half later, at that point, I figured I didn't get the job; I just wanted my reimbursement check, which I had not gotten an update on. I got a copy and pasted email with errors (they left another staff member's signature on it) saying I did not get the job; no other text was included. I followed up about reimbursement said I would get it in a couple of days that the staff member who was to process wasn't in. I did get it three days later. \n\nOverall I was not impressed with the process. The communication was horrible. The interview lasted 45 mins, and the campus visit lasted three hours. I am writing this review because I think ghosting a candidate after a campus visit is reflective of a toxic culture. Also important to note for prospective candidates at Penn State Scranton the campus itself is not accessible to those who have mobility issues.

I was invited to campus for an interview a few weeks later. Lodging accommodations were lovely, but the hotel was a significant distance from campus which was inconvenient (dare I say inconsiderate) for an 8 a.m. start time and this also automatically made me curious if not apprehensive about the immediate area. \r\n\r\nThroughout the day, various interviewers asked me several times if I noticed any \"red flags\" about the position/institution.\r\n\r\nStill, after a thorough and very comfortable interview/introduction process with a bevy of department employees and associates I was quite optimistic about the possibility of working at the Behrend campus. However, my excitement was short lived due to 1. a slightly awkward campus tour that did finally lift some of those asked-about red flags and 2. the 20-minute wrap up with the supervisor for this position. After a very long (and cold) day, I had the last-minute, very unexpected surprise that the live-off housing position I was applying for would pay at least $15,000 less than the live-on position I currently held.\r\n\r\nBut wait, it gets better. ... I did not let on that I was surprised and discouraged by the salary disclosure and I was told that my references would be checked the following week and I should expect the background check process to begin soon. I was one of three total candidates who were invited to campus. Well, none of my references were checked nor was the background check initiated. The week after my interview, news of the Penn State sex abuse scandal broke and I respectfully decided not to call and bother anyone with petty questions about my candidacy during such a difficult time for the university. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the way I learned I would not be offered a position was not by letter (or more appropriately at this stage, a phone call) from the position's supervisor or human resources associate. No, more than a month following my interview, a public repost of the position was my first clue that I was no longer being considered for it. Out of sheer curiosity, I had to call and was told the department still needed to find the \"best fit\" (personality) to fill the position. That's right. After what seemed like a very lengthy and bureaucratic process, the selection committee was not satisfied by ANY of the final three candidates they brought to campus for an EXEMPT ADMINISTATIVE position that pays less than what I earned waiting tables in college.\r\n\r\nI consider it a blessing that I did not have to learn the hard way that the personalities in this very proud department are so picky and presumably hard to please.", "Interview Questions": "Have there been any red flags about working here so far?"}, {"date": "25 Nov 2015", "title": "Graduate Research Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Penn State (University Park, PA) in Oct 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview process is straightforward.
