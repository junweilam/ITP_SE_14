I received an email from HR asking to schedule a phone interview about 3 weeks later. The phone call with HR was very basic--just asking me about my background and my interest in the position.

The first team was larger, so I met with two upper level hiring mangers for about 30 minutes and then with two Senior Health Care Analysts for 30 minutes. For the second interview, I just met with two upper level team members. Both sets of interviews were fairly standard. They wanted to know about my background and my interest in NCQA--my experience working with multiple projects simultaneously, competing deadlines, time management skills, working with teams, etc. They also talked about the projects their team are involved in and what this person's role would be. I felt both interviews went well. During both interviews it was mentioned that the teams were also interviewing internal candidates. I appreciated having this information, but I also realized that my chances of getting either position were fairly slim. And, as I had suspected, both teams ended up promoting from within and hired internal applicants. I can't begrudge them wanting to develop and grow their teams internally, but I suspect that as a result it's difficult to get hired into the organization as anything other than an entry-level analyst.\r\n\r\nThe entire process, from application to second rejection was about 10 weeks.
