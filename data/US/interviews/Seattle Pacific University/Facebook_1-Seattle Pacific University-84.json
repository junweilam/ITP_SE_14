As a Christian school, they want to know if you are a Christian and if you broadly agree with their beliefs. My issue was that all but one of those beliefs was disclosed on their website ahead of time. Their \"Statement Regarding Human Sexuality\" is not advertised online. As such, one cannot determine before this 'fit' interview whether or not they agree with the statement.\r\n\r\nAs one might fear, the statement makes claims about sex, gender, and sexual orientation that many people, including some Christians, disagree with. The HR representative made it clear that I did not have to personally affirm this statement, but that one needed to be comfortable being a part of an institution that held this belief.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I turned the job down, so I did not have to make a decision about whether or not to live with this.

After that, I received an offer letter in timely manner.  All in all about 2 weeks worth of time based on scheduling.\r\nProcess was conducted professionally.  Based on how they interviewed me, It is understandable why they were among the only 3 universities in WA to be ranked in the 2017 <major college reviewer> best national universities list.\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nFirst of all, it is a private religious college.  Expect to get questioned about your religious belief.  That being said, the university has an open and inclusive policy.  During the interview process, I never felt judged.  In fact I was surprised that during the HR interview process, the main subject was about not discriminating nor judging others choices.  \r\nSecond, a benefit that I felt during the application process was that this was a mission driven institution with preparation of students for a productive positively impact life was the priority.  \r\nDuring the interview process the majority of people I met seemed open, interested in me, and easy to communicate with.  I felt they loved where they worked and made me want to work there too.\r\nThe position itself had a diverse set of technology to support as well as immediate growth plans for new technology with stated ability to contribute to current and future solutions.

Both personal benefits such as contributing to a world improving organization as well as benefits such as vacation, holidays, ...  \r\nUnfortunately, after reviewing the position, I could not take it due to commute distance and time impact on family.

Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched off at present. You are outside the room, and the door is closed.
