The interview process was 3 parts: a 4 person panel, one on one with the Director, and one on one with a Vice Chancellor. The panel part was all situational questions; what would you do if a student/parent asked/told you this? There was a script that they stuck to, bouncing around the room each asking different questions. They only asked one general question about what experience I had that I felt qualified me for the position. The one on one with the Director was more for me to ask specific questions about the position and the one on one with the Vice Chancellor is her stressing the importance of always acting professional in the position.", "Interview Questions": "1.You are at a college fair and a parent who is an alum comes up to you. He is mad that Col. Reb is no longer the mascot and says he refuses to allow his children to attend Ole Miss until the Col. is back on the field. What do you say?\r\n2. What do you tell a prospective student who wants to major in something Ole Miss does not offer?\r\n3. What's more important, style or substance?
