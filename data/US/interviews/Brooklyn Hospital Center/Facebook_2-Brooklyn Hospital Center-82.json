Was first contacted by recruitment to which they left me a message and when I called back multiple times could not get in contact with the person who contacted me. I was then contacted by another person to schedule an interview. Several hours later was finally contacted back by the person who initially contacted me to discuss the position to which I then had to inform the person I had already been contacted to schedule an interview. On the day of the interview the person I was suppose to interview with was apparently busy and could not meet with me so I ended up meeting with the person in charge of recruitment. She barely interviewed me and appeared to not truly be considering me for the recruitment specialist position at all. Instead they kept trying to push a temporary benefits position on me which I didn\u2019t apply for and to which I stated several times thru out the process that I was not interested in as I was only interested in full time permanent work. Nonetheless, after this entire process I was glad to not advance in the process as this does not seem like a company that would be a good fit for me/company I would want to work for. There were too many red flags in the interview/initial phase contact which tells me I probably avoided working in a toxic environment!", "Interview Questions": "What do you look for when sourcing a candidate?"}, {"date": "22 Oct 2021", "title": "Technical Recruiter Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Brooklyn Hospital Center", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview process was extremely unprofessional to the point where I felt racially targeted as a Bipoc. I applied via indeed and within 3 minutes received a call to phone screen which is a red flag. Either the department is desperate to hire or they\u2019re recruitment strategy isn\u2019t great. During the call I was asked to provide reasons for leaving previous employment and to discuss compensation early on without the recruiter discussing the company, the role, any benefits or what they\u2019re looking for. Also, she was extremely passive aggressive in which she kept making assumptions and also stating how they work closely with one another and the right person has to be respectful. I asked if she had any concerns or hesitations about me and she stated this again. Her communication and questions were extremely biased. The salary given was 60k which is under the market value for the industry and she was extremely unpleasant. Now I see why they\u2019re experiencing a staffing shortage. No matter how bad you need a job make sure you find an employer that respects you and doesn\u2019t tell you that you only look good on paper (resume).
