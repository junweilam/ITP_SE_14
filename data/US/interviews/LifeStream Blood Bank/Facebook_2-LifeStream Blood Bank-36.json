She progressed me to the panel interview. \r\n\r\nThe office complex is nice - appeared new - and the receptionist was friendly.Three-person panel; the primary person arrived more than 15 minutes late and the other two persons as much as ten minutes later. Nothing extraordinary in terms of the questions; they were basic. What was extraordinary, however, was that near the end of the interview one of the panel raters (who was the least friendly from the start) literally glared at me for nearly a minute.\r\n\r\nInitially, I waited for him to comment. He did not, so I broke my visual engagement and glanced at the other two people to see if they noticed - but they were apparently unaware, writing commentary. I looked back...the intense staring had continued. I am uncertain as to whether this was some sort of tactic, but after thinking \"Hmm...hostile...\" I tuned my focus to the other two persons. The glarer never looked me in the eye again. He had been introduced as ex-military, hence, that is the only thing to which I can attribute his actions. Even as I shook hands when departing, that gentleman did not look me in the eye.\r\n\r\nOdd, and my most unique interviewing experience to this day. The process was slow. The HR contact never issued any type of pre- or post-interview communication and did not appreciate follow-up. I did manage to extract the response that they decided to fill the post internally. There appears to be considerable turnover because I noted the same position posted again within four months and several months later. \r\n\r\nI believe it was a blessing in disguise not to have been hired.
