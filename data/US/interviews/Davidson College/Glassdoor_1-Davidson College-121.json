The interview was the most formal phone interview I've ever had, and the most formal interview I've had in an educational institution in general. \r\n\r\nThe interviewer was late to the call, then rushed me through at the end because she had another call immediately following. Big pet peave when people think their time is worth more than mine. \r\n\r\nI thought I did well, and the interviewer said they would be in touch the following Monday with next steps for in-person interviews. That was about a month and a half ago. I sent a thank-you note immediately after the interview, then I followed up the following week since I never heard back as promised. Still nothing. I check my status online often and it still says \"in progress\". \r\n\r\nVery disappointing.
