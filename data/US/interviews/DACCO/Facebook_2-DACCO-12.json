I interviewed with the CFO and HR and the interview went well.  A lot of talk around the \"staff\" set in their ways and this role would need to change that in order to progress the position and company.  Fair enough, I felt good about the position in order to continue the conversation.  They knew my salary was higher than the posted position, but seemed to be flexible if the right candidate came through.  I few days later, I WAS OFFERED THE JOB VERBALLY. It was lower than what I am currently making, so we started to negotiate.  Biggest concerns were PTO, health insurance and salary.  They came back with a better salary offer (something that was above what I am currently  making - thanks), health insurance to start in 30 days (asked to get it to start on hire) and 18 PTO days (have twice as much currently).  It was very weird that I was VERBALLY OFFERED THE JOB even though I was told that the next round of interviews would be with the CEO.\r\n\r\nA few days go by without any continued conversation of my offer, and I then got a call by HR asking if I could meet with the CEO of the company?  Kind of thought this was weird because I was already offered the job, but OK be good to meet them as I was going to possibly work there (so I thought).  \r\n\r\nHad my interview with the CEO and it went well, felt we were on the same page. She even showed me my office!  I was surprised that she asked me what my salary expectations were. You would think she would know that especially after it was higher than the range.  We talked about the Glassdoor reviews and she was aware of them and it seemed like they were addressing them (even though the past CFO had issues with management).  It was also communicated that a lot of these reviews were from support staff and not the corporate staff.\r\n\r\nI left thinking that job was pretty much mine.  I did ask for compensation for COBRA should they not be able to start the insurance upon my first day.  She of course said \"we can work on that\".  I did not receive any correspondence for 5 days in which I called and emailed HR to see what was going on since THEY OFFERED ME THE JOB VERBALLY.  Still no response for almost a week.  Then I received an email stating they are working on a few things and would get back to me shortly.  Well, a few days go by and I get the canned response thanking me for my time and they have chosen not to continue our conversation!  Really? You offered the position, negotiated terms, did not follow the protocol of your hiring process, was told by the CEO this is where I will be sitting and you send that?  I am thankful that it did not work out. I would have gotten in there, noticed that the leadership is a complete joke and would be looking for a new job within 6 months!
