I scheduled a phone screen with a recruiter and was asked about my background, reasons for interest in the organization and position, and if I was okay with the salary range for the position. The next interview was with the hiring manager and lasted about an hour. During the hour, I was asked an array of questions, some of which seemed off-topic or out of the blue and some of which related to the responsibilities for the role. The final interview was with a member of the community affairs team. Prior to the interview, I overheard the recruiter and team member talking about what experience the team member had with interviewing. The interview was normal enough however and only lasted about half an hour. Of the two interviews, the interview with the hiring manager was much more helpful in understanding what the role entailed and what they expected from a candidate.

When I inquired to see if there was room to negotiate since I had the experience and the skillset, they said yes, but their counter was still not near the number I wanted to be. I inquired if there were any more wiggle room for the number I wanted, and again, the recruiter said yes and she\u2019d get back to me. Imagine my surprise when she called me back and then revealed to me, \u201cSorry, we looked into our budget and we don\u2019t even have room for the two higher numbers.
