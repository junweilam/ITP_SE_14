The first was an interview screen with a recruiter - a basic 15-20 minute call where you walk through your resume and discuss why you want to work at NAS. The questions were pretty standard. One question which I didn't expect was when the interviewer asked me what makes me different from the other candidates as I have the same qualifications as every other person who has applied..the wording of this question honestly seemed a bit rude. The interview ended with salary discussion on what you expect to be paid. \r\n\r\nThe second interview was with the Senior Program Officer and a program assistant and/or consultant. Note, I did two different interviews for two departments on the same week so the panel interviewers varied but normally consisted of a panel interview with 2-4 people. I found this process to be a bit off as the \"lower ranking\" people seemed to all turn on their videos for the zoom interview but the \"high ranking\" SPO decided not to turn on their video for both of their interviews. It was really awkward having my video turned on and talking to the other staff members but not being able to see the highest ranking SPO during the conversation. It made it really difficult to detect facial cues and resulting in a lot of awkward silences. \r\n\r\nI was invited to a third interview with their Executive Director. I declined at this point because I was offered a position at another organization and decided to accept that. \r\n\r\nOverall, this interview process was of and felt like I was just a number in a sea of candidates. It was not personal, the staff/interviewers did not try to get to know me and I really didn't have the opportunity to get to know staff members and company culture. I felt pretty rushed during the allocated 1 hour interview phase, where both my interviews ended in 40 minutes because it seemed like the SPO had more important things to do. This was one of the stiffest interviews I have been on - and felt more like a transaction than a conversation. Very mechanical and impersonal.

They asked me what makes me stand out from all the other candidates. I thought that it was an unnecessary question because they have my resume! Also, this question is subjective, but I gave an objective answer by reiterating the job qualifications and my resume. We also discussed salary, and the recruiter made it clear that is it not negotiable, but they wanted to prepare me I suppose in case we proceeded further. \r\nFeb 21 - Met with the director and a senior program officer. They were both friendly. It was more of a discussion. I prepared tremendously for this position. I gave them hard copies of examples of my own work, including publications, manuals, and guidelines that I developed from my previous jobs. I also gave them hard copies of the material on what I knew about NAS and their productivity, and I had questions on their evaluation of performance by giving them specific examples. In addition, I gave them a paper on what studies I would conduct if I was selected as a Senior Program Officer, and who to contact to work with other people in the field. I gave the about 5 project proposals and wrote them with references. Towards the end of the interview, the director was impressed. In fact, he said that my work is outstanding and it he thought it was a really great interview. Personally, I thought that it was a great interview too! I over prepared and worked really hard, and it showed. This interview lasted over the time limit because the director and I had many questions to ask each other. \r\nMarch 11 - No updated on my application so I emailed the recruiter for the status. They said that they were still interviewing more candidates. \r\nJuly 7 - I was informed that the job was CANCELED, and that they ceased recruiting efforts for that job!  \r\n\r\nOverall, I was extremely positive and energetic during the interview. I showed a lot of ambition and enthusiasm than any normal person! I am also a very young person applying for the Senior Program Officer position. IMO, I think all these things could have been the reason why I wasn't selected. This is a very flat organization and people have worked there many years. It not uncommon for people to feel complacent. When I came into the building, I can already sense the dreary mood. However, I felt more compelled to get a job here despite the negative reviews. I felt that I could have been the person to balance out the potential team/organization with my energy. Perhaps, I wasn't selected because it could have been a cultural mis-match. Anyways, if you get an interview, take it! I still believe that it was a tremendous honor to even get an interview at the National Academy of Sciences!

I met with four people, including a second interview with the hiring manager. Each interview went really well and I was confident at the end I had a great shot at the position.

I was then informed of a second position opening and was asked to apply, as I did make a good impression and a future at IOM was something they saw for me. I applied and was asked to wait 1 week. After 1 week, I was told no decision was made on the position, but was asked to come in with very short notice to meet three more people for 2 other possible RA positions available. I rearranged my schedule and went in to meet the other team members. With much delayed notification and waiting, I did not get 2/3 of the jobs I was then being considered for and the 3rd was waiting on funding. \r\n\r\nAs you can see it was quite an ordeal and required lots of waiting and patience.

At this point, I have been offered a job at another company, but thought I would share my experience in case anyone else is patiently waiting replies. \r\n\r\nIt was quite lovely to meet with the staff, they are very smart and driven people. I do feel I made a large time commitment with lot's of positive feedback followed by disappointment that I did not get the positions discussed.
