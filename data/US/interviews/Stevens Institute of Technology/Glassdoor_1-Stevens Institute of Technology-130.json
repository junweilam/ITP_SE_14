They clearly didn't coordinate questions because they were asking me the same things.  On top of that, they were outrageously rude.  It felt more like an interrogation.  I had spent time researching the Career Center and the Institute online.  I was mocked that I was sharing the data that I read about and I was asked what else I knew besides the information on the website.  I honestly did not know what to say to that nasty comment since I thought part of the interview was for them to tell me more about it since I have never worked there.  Additionally, one of the interviewers was picking apart my work experience and educational experience from 10 years ago.  It was completely ridiculous and irrelevant (such a long time ago).  She was asking me when I worked part time and when I went to school part time, when I transitioned to full time, etc.  There have been times with I worked 2 part-time jobs to survive, while going to school, things in my life changed (I am a human, so sue me).  This privileged person probably had the luxury of being dependent on others financially and could simply not understand why anyone would leave a job or pursue their education.  She also made a comment about how it was strange that I took a new job during COVID-19 which was bizarre to me.  Wouldn't it be a strong point that I helped a company get through the pandemic?
