From the phone interview that was conducted a month ago, the director of this office gave me very little comfort that I would be seriously considered. Despite what the job description lists, she indicated that she\u2019s looking for a candidate with several years of experience. The new hire is someone she hopes can take over her responsibilities with little to no supervision. The director also mentioned that she does not want to train the new hire. To me, this describes more of an Associate Director, which I am capable of doing. However, the description of the role is very entry level. The director also challenged my education, insisting that anything earned through online effort does not compare to hands-on experience. I didn\u2019t expect to proceed further after the phone interview, but I received an invite for a face-to-face based on my eagerness to join Iona. Once again, the director challenged my education and made the determination then and there that I was not going to be her best choice for the role. I was bummed, thinking how I could have convinced her better. But I realized the red flags about this director later. Coupled with the negative views on the DSHE program, she\u2019s dishonest with what she seeks in a candidate and stubborn about her views. Knowing that I was not her best choice from the phone interview, it\u2019s also inconsiderate of her to invite me in for a face-to-face, which took me away from my day job.", "Interview Questions": "What is an emotional support animal?"}, {"date": "6 Jan 2020", "title": "Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 week.\u00a0I interviewed at Iona College (New Rochelle, NY) in Jan 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied online, I received a phone call about a week later.
