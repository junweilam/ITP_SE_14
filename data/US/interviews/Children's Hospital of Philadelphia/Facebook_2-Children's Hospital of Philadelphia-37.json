This was then followed by approximately 20 minutes of asking behavioral questions that had to do with CHOP's core values and how prior work that I've done could relate to them. \n\nAfter this interview I received no more communication from the company.

I was then scheduled to interview with two members of the team. After those I was contacted to do two additional separate interviews with other team members. After 4 distinct interviews they couldn\u2019t even bother to reach out to say the position was filled. I had to email the hiring manager to get a response which I think is ridiculous considering the time put in to this process and just extremely disrespectful and unprofessional. They should just have one panel interview instead of 4 separate because candidates don\u2019t have all the time in the world to interview for positions they aren\u2019t even going to get. Stop wasting people\u2019s time. My time is just as valuable as a hiring managers. In addition I had to submit my transcripts and contact information for 5 references and past HR representatives. Those aren\u2019t thing you should have to submit before even guaranteeing  an offer. You would think they would have one ounce of consideration for people with us being in the middle of a pandemic. It\u2019s amazing to me how these health care organizations and centers who have missions involved with helping people, and want to champion diversity for publicity don\u2019t even have hiring managers who exhibit decency or just the bare minimum communication skills. If you can contact me for four separate interviews that I have to prepare for and make time for than there is absolutely no reason you can\u2019t contact me to notify that you have picked another candidate.

I applied online and heard back from them after two weeks. What happened after that is as follow:\r\n\r\nStep 1:  As first round of interview they gave a Data Exercise with submission guidelines. It was a lengthy exercise but not too tough if you have experience with Healthcare data. It took about 4-5 hours to finish that exercise. \r\n\r\nStep 2: After two weeks from the date of submission of Data Exercise Assignment, I heard back from them saying they would like to schedule a phone interview. I gave my availability time 4 times, and never heard back on time. They would email back a day after. Finally got hold of them after two weeks and they said they had glitch in their system and emails were not getting through. I again provided the time and yet the manager called an hour early from the scheduled time. Horrible management. It was very generic phone screening kind of round and in 20 min of conversation she said she would like to have me for an onsite interview.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Onsite interview is 5 hours long. \r\na) First round is Data exercise (1 hour). It is conceptual and no programming was involved. Interviewer gave the feedback that all your answers are correct.\r\nb) Second round was a case study(1 hour). It was a pretty straight forward data cohort study. there were two interviewers in this round. All questions were related to case study. And again they said we liked your answers.\r\nc) Lunch with the team in a very informal setting(45 min). They literally take you to building cafeteria and ask you to order whatever. I have never seen something like this before. I was about to pay for my food, that's when the interviewer said let me pay for you. I politely refused but didn't want to be disrespectful so let her pay. It was hard to talk with 8 people on the table and eat a sandwich.\r\nc) Technical Round (1 Hour): Next round was supposedly Technical round. But she was asking general questions about my experience. In this round I learned that they only use R and Qlik. In job requirement they have asked for Python and Tableau and SAS. They don't even have that. Not sure how I was judged on the very first round. Again disappointing.\r\nd) Another Behavioral round. (30 min)\r\n15min break\r\ne) Presentation (30 min) - For onsite interview they make you present on a topic. They gave the topic and asked to prepare a 15 min presentation. Almost 9 people were in presentation and almost everyone will ask you a question. It was another 4-5 hours job to work on this presentation.\r\nf) Another 30 min wrap up interview with the Hiring Manager. Nice person overall. She made it seem like that team liked you.\r\n\r\nThey don't provide any travel assistance for the onsite interview. So if you are not from Philly or not within driving distance from Philly, I would recommend you think twice. \r\n\r\nWithin 3 Days I hear back Negative. If as an interviewer you expect the person to devote more than 20 hours to work with you and spend $500 to fly in for interview, the least you can do is call personally and tell what went wrong. Ridiculous. It is fine if you don't want to hire me, but being disrespectful of someone's time is not acceptable. \r\n\r\nHighly disappointing experience.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about yourself?

Granted, I didnt have two years of QA experience in a healthcare environment, but I did have 2+ years of QA experience in banking and finance.  Before I continue, let me mention a few things first:\r\n\r\n- My interview was in the Wood Center, which is in a area that's TERRIBLE for parking. The Wood Center has it's own parking area underneath, but in the mornings, it's extremely packed. So, if you have an interview there, I highly recommend you catch the bus or get dropped off.\r\n\r\n- Secondly, the HR lady gave me horrible directions. \" Just go up to the fifth floor and go to the receptionist \"  may seem easy to understand, but when you walk in the building, you'll quickly realize how large the place is and how they have an plethora of elevators each going to different floors.\r\n\r\n- Finally, the people who work there aren't too helpful in pointing you in the right direction. So prepare to read a bunch of signs and stopping random people in the halls for help.  ARRIVE EXTREMELY EARLY.\r\n\r\nI digress.\r\n\r\nAs I arrived to the correct room, I had to wait in the waiting area for about twenty minutes before my interviewer actually arrived. While waiting, I looked around at the environment --  boring grays and browns, large cubicles, pictures of older people (40-65.. I'm 25) all over the clipboards. Really slow-paced. \r\n\r\nFortunately though, during the interview, the lady I met with was very pleasant and easy to get along with. I effortlessly answered all of the typical behavioral questions with vibrant examples of my successes in the past and made the interview more like a conversation than an interrogation. \r\n\r\nShe then dropped the bomb on me : She wasn't looking for someone with a lot of healthcare exp at all -- she was more focused on finding someone with background in billing, finance, etc..  \r\n\r\nRight up my alley on paper, but I could feel in the depths of my gut that this wasn't the place I needed to be. The place just gave off indecisive vibes to me.  She told me the next step (a second interview) would come in about a month, which I didn't have time for. I desire quick, consistent, cooperation.  She was incredibly perceptive and i'm sure picked up on the fact that I loss interest in the position before the interview ended.\r\n\r\nWhich is probably why I didn't get a call back.  That, or because of the fact I accidentally called her a different name at the end of the interview. :)  My mistake. Anyway,  It's all good though. Turns out that my friend got the position instead -- and he thinks it's barely alright.  =P\r\n\r\nSalary I asked for was 38k-45k. They were comfortable with that range.\r\n\r\nGreat opportunity.
