The process took two weeks. Relatively fast to clear a phone interview and obtain an in-person interview. Interviewed with a panel of two- one was clearly experienced in interviews and very professional. The other was cold, inpersonable and cut me off multiple times to ask for a generic interview answers. This individual was not open to clarifying question from me as a candidate. I have been interviewing candidates as a non-profit director for years and recognized this as disinterest in me as a candidate immediately. I have never been so cold to any individual in an interview. This seems like an honorable organization with wonderful intentions and a positive impact that probably does not treat employees well. Corporate appearance of individuals promoting economic empowerment. Definitely not a come as you are non-profit.
