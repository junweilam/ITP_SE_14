Filling out the application was a manual process, but then you were required to fill out a questionnaire that asked for very similar information. Following that, I waw contacted to verify that I could relocate, since the position was not remote and I was out of state. \nThe initial conversation with the recruiter went well at first, but then shifted quickly. The recruiter did not understand the differences between roles posted, and suggested I apply to several. This was a bit of a put off, and a red flag. They were also concerned about salary, but the range they posted in the job ad was too large to get a feel for the real hiring salary. I asked what the true range was, but only got a vague response. \nAfter the inital call, I was told that an interview would be set up with the hiring manager. It took about a week for them to reach back out to me. It went downhill from there. First, before the interview I was sent a link that asked for 5 references, at least two direct managers. They wanted them within 24 hours. I asked for a delay, and it was approved, until after the interview with the hiring manager.\nThe interview was scheduled a few days after. No one showed up for the interview. After waiting 10 minutes, for a 30 minute interview, I reached out to the hiring manager. They apologized and said something came up and they would jump on the call immediately. Well, it only got worse from there. The manager was unprepared and did not know who I was, what my background was, and had no questions prepared. This was odd, but also very disappointing. There was no enthusiasm and it was like they didn't want to be there. I asked the majority of the questions, and when I got to the expectations of the role I couldn't get clear responses. The only thing they were concerned about was the salary. I gave a number in the middle. Was told to expect a call in 2 weeks, never was contacted.
