It was about 10 people with 1 or 2 questions each and consisted of the original 3 plus the CIO, and several technicians. The questions were designed to get a feel for your character, I guess. They were off the wall questions and the CIO asked most of them. I think the second interview was a bit inappropriate and pressure is on when 10 people including the CIO are waiting for your answer.

Most questions seemed to be the first thing that popped into their heads, it was very awkward and most of the questions seemed to have no real purpose.
