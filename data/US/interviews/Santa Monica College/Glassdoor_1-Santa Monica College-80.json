After a month, I recieved a response to move onto the first portion of the interview, an online assestmemt. Two weeks after completing the assessment, I moved onto the next round in the process which was a virtual interview scheduled a week out from their initial response. I recieved some worksheets on how to prepare for the interview and example responses, but this did not prepare me for how cold the interviewers would be. I was notified that a panel of 6 individuals would be interviewing me, and was only interviewed by 2 which wasn't bad. But upon starting the interview the staff gave me the feeling that they needed to interview me for the sake of the process and was already not considering me. They were cold with introductions, and most of the time were not looking at the screen when I was speaking to them. SMC discusses and promotes a non-biased interview process, but the removal of all energy and emotion from the interview made me feel unwelcomed and very distant from my interviewers. The interview was a total of 30 minutes on zoom, I was put on a list of Administrative Assistants to be moved onto the next round but will not be moving forward with the company as this was one of the most uncomfortable interviews I have had.", "Interview Questions": "How have you created and fostered relationships with your supervisor/managers/coworkers in previous positions?"}, {"date": "14 May 2023", "title": "Career Counselor Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Santa Monica College (Santa Monica, CA)", "Interview Descriptions": "Extremely offensive and elitist interview experience.

The first step is a written exam offered on a single set date (Saturday). Took the morning to complete. The exam was simple enough and as expected from the job title. Then, an oral exam is conducted several weeks later. This again is on a set date (weekday) without flexibility and not leaving any room for input from you or your questions. The final step on your end is an ACTUAL interview (YAY!) that lasts less than 20 minutes and is not at all about getting to know you or your skills, rather yet another set of questions very similar to those in the oral exam.  Again, there is no time/room for input from you, which is a clear indication to me that they are not looking for a long-term employee who would really excel there. I would estimate at least 8 people (8!!) made it to the actual interview for a single open position. Overall, I was displeased with the process, and the apparent lack of interest by the interviewers. I would not recommend this process unless you are out of work and have a LOT of time to devote to a convoluted process that is stacked against you.
