She explained the philosophy of the hospital and we had a casual conversation regarding how I feel about their philosophy etc. Because she worked in human resources, she did not ask me any questions regarding my actual laboratory experience, just feeling out how I would fit into the hospital's overall experience, I guess. I was then introduced to the laboratory manager who asked me one or two questions and then introduced me to the laboratory supervisor, who seemed eager for me to work in their lab, however, I was not given an offer. I feel as though they place too much power in hiring in human resources, despite the fact they are not who you will be working for, nor do they understand how to evaluate someone's laboratory experience.", "Interview Questions": "Does this philosophy seem like something that would interest you?"}, {"date": "27 Feb 2018", "title": "Mental Health Worker Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Northern Westchester Hospital (New York, NY) in Feb 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "i was called in for an interview and was scheduled to meet with the talent acquisition specialist. this part of the interview was approx 1 hour long. afterwards, i met with the manager of the unit i was applying for.", "Interview Questions": "explain a situation in which you were able to deescalate a crisis situation "}, {"date": "9 Jan 2014", "title": "RN Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "N/A", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Northern Westchester Hospital", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview with HR and unit manager, Math test had to pass with at least 85%", "Interview Questions": "There wasn't one"}, {"date": "16 Feb 2017", "title": "Ultrasound Technologist Supervisor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Northern Westchester Hospital (Mount Kisco, NY) in May 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "I got hired because I was nice but more for my appearance.

The HR rep asked basic questions related to my work experience and discussed information about benefits and salary. The HR rep was very pleasant, professional, and gave a positive first impression of the hospital staff and culture. After the meeting with HR, I was ushered to a waiting room near the unit. I waited almost 2 hours for the second portion of my interview to start, which was scheduled with the respective unit's nurse manager. The HR rep kept stopping by to check on me, offered me water,  and appeared sincerely apologetic about the substantial delay in the interview process. The nurse manager breezed by me in the wait area several times, told me she was running late with \"meetings\", and could be periodically overheard chatting with staff in the neighboring offices. When the nurse manager finally graced me with her presence, she complained about being \"too busy with meetings all day.\" She appeared unprepared for the interview. The only question she asked was, \"Tell me about you.\" She detailed the job description. Then she took me on a leisurely tour of the unit, showing me every room, closet, patient bathroom, etc, and introduced me to various staff. This tour was the bulk of our meeting. Then she tried to introduce me to the unit's medical director, who was on the phone. She made me wait for an additional 15 minutes in her office until the medical director ended her call. While I waited in the nurse manager's office,  she answered emails and retrieved phone messages.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}]]
