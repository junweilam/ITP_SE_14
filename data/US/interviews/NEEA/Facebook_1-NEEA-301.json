I was told it wouldn\u2019t be more than 15 minutes and we were to discuss my background and why I\u2019m interested in the position. From the start, the interview was very terse. Although I attempted to engage the HR rep in pleasantries and prompt some sort of verbal exchange following my responses, it never happened. The questions themselves were highly specific, which caught me off guard especially after I was lead to believe this was a more informal discussion.
