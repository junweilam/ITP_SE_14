You have a group interview then a single interview if you make the group process. Here are some tips for the group interview\r\n\r\n- Don't insult anyone\r\n- Give people compliments\r\n- Try to be a team player\r\n- Let others take the lead\r\n- Get others to give feedback\r\n\r\nRA'ing is all about putting a fake face on to build community. So, just think off all the bad things people do in group situations and just don't do those things. I remember when I was a proctor of these interviews we hated individuals who just took charge the whole time. Leadership is good, not including others and shooting down other people's ideas isn't. Let others speak and include them and don't be obnoxious.\r\n\r\nThe single interview is quite easy:\r\n\r\n- First and foremost know DePaul's mission statement and its values. \r\n- Read up on conflict managment. They will ask you questions about how you would solve a conflict just don't say anything stuipd such as \"I would yell at the person\". Talk about how you would look at both sides and stay calm during these kinds of situations. \r\n- They'll ask you how you would build community just have some ideas on how you would do that in a Residence Hall. Cookies for everyone, go out and see a show in Chicago you know things like that.\r\n\r\n- One question that usually trumps people is \"How you would helped underepresented minorities?\" this could include the LGBTQ community, African Americans, Asians and such. Just a tip, if you are a underepresented minority yes talk about your own self however focus on other minorities. We always get the LGBTQ guy or girl who just talks about the LGBTQ community. Yes, we know you can be an advocate for them but how can you be an advocate for others? \r\n\r\nAnswer: talk about how you'll get involved with on-campus stuff that already exists. \r\n\r\nCouple other tips:\r\n\r\nJust think professional and practice. If you need someone to repeat the question again ask and don't be afraid to ask for clarification. If you don't know an answer or can't think of something on the spot just make up something that makes you look good.", "Interview Questions": "How would you be an advocate for underepresented minorities on campus?"}, {"date": "6 Nov 2015", "title": "Coordinator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 months.\u00a0I interviewed at DePaul University (Chicago, IL) in Mar 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview itself was fine.

DePaul was external.  I found the opening through their career site, posted my resume, and filled out the online application.  I don't believe I had any connections at the university then.\r\n\r\nI had been working in higher education administration at the time (mostly Registrar or academic records type experience) and felt that this would be a good move for me.  The position struck me as something of a glorified academic advisor with some additional operational responsibilities.  It was not advertised at the time that this position was for the School of Theatre.  My undergrad and \"background\" were in theatre, so this was more than a pleasant surprise.\r\n\r\nLooking back at my records, I was contacted within a few days of my having posted the resume, and I was able to set up a phone interview with a member of the \"search committee\", who were conducting further review of at least a few other applicants.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the phone interview.  My interviewer commended my accomplishments, noting that I had the \"good scout\" qualities that they would typically look for.  He told me that this committee had reviewed the resumes submitted, whittled down applicants, and that I had made it to the \"semi-final\" round.\r\n\r\nWe had a great conversation.  His experience with the school and university were quite extensive, and this being a passion of mine, I was not at a loss for informational questions to ask.\r\n\r\nA little over a month went by, and I was not contacted for the position.  I decided to contact my interviewer to thank him once more and to wish them the best.  I was then and am now still thinking heavily on what academic or professional direction I should try to take next, so I asked whether I might keep him as a contact.  I heard back within hours, and he graciously agreed to help out however he might be able.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I recently contacted this individual once more, and he actually remembered who I was.  He definitely left me with a great feeling about DePaul and gave me some really good background information about DePaul's Vincentian roots.
