I went to the interview feeling friendly and confident, but unfortunately, the hiring manager was incredibly rude. I'm actually relieved that I didn't get the job. It seemed like she had no interest in being part of the meeting at all. I understand that things happen, but at the very least, basic courtesy would have been appreciated. She asked me only one question that didn't make any sense, and then abruptly stated that she was done and had no further questions for me. On the other hand, the other interviewer was quite pleasant and carried on with the interview. When I asked follow-up questions to the hiring manager, her answers didn't make any sense to me. It's no wonder they've been struggling to hire someone for months or why people are leaving.
