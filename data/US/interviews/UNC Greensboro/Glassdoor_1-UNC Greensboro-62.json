One includes an individual assessment in front of a small panel. Panel varies from two to five professional individuals in UNCG Housing and Residence Life (HRL). You will be asked about 20 questions (expect to be there for 30 mins to an hour). Questions will include anything from \"give us an example of when you dealt with a hardship,\" to \"who's your inspiration?\" \r\n\r\nThe key during the individual process is to truly be yourself!!  Please be yourself during this process. If not, you may find the job difficult and not something you have interest in.  The reason this could be bad is because you are dealing with other students. Look at yourself as being in customer service.  For instance, if you don't like helping people and being patient to others needs or working as a community you will find yourself miserable and this might carry out into your work and how you deal with others and the students.  So, be yourself, be truthful and if you are a good fit it will show!\r\n\r\nAlso during the individual process don't be scared to mention how you've made mistakes. As long as you explain how you truly have grown from it and what you learned. We all mistakes, so if a question is brought up regarding this don't say you are perfect or never made mistakes.  We all have. The true test is seeing what it has taught you. \r\n\r\nIf you can't accept others differences such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, etc. then this is probably not the job for you. Be prepared to encounter different people and be prepared to open your mind and extend your hands to everyone!  We all struggle, especially students who are transitioning into their new adult lives. Be prepared to assist others. \r\n\r\nSo...\r\n\r\nthe second process with be a group interview which consist of specific activities to look at different areas.  For instance some look at how you work in groups, if you are a leader, how you solve problems, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe key to the group interview is....yep, you guessed it, be yourself! If you are naturally quite or like to take charge thats okay! Be who you are.  Students who get this job are not a specific type.  They are not all \"cheerleaders\" (as i was once told). Some of the best RA's (resident advisors) i've known ranged from calmer at heart to on the go. So be you. \r\n\r\nThe key is to be spirted which means just truly enjoy what the job entails as well as engaging.  If you like to engage others you will be fine.  Being an RA gives you the freedom to do it \"your way!\" Some RA's engage students by knocking door to door with candy and a survey and other RA's do it by leaving a survey at the door and those who answer get candy (see what i mean). So be yourself.  It will make it easier to see who are and how you will fit in. Because they are looking to hire diverse groups not a group filled with only \"cheerleading RA's.\"", "Interview Questions": "\"Give us an example when you have dealt with diversity?\"   "}, {"date": "2 Jun 2015", "title": "Resident Advisor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at UNC Greensboro (Greensboro, NC) in Feb 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview process begins with a group interview conducted by current RAs that observe how you interact with your peers.
