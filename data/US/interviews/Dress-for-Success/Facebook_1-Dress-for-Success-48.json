I never heard back-- not even a generic bounce back email saying that they received my email.  Never assuming the worst, I checked my junk mail folder, checked back often, and nothing. Eventually LinkedIn updated the job post saying that it was no longer available. :(\r\n\r\nI'm big on communication and respect for peoples time no matter what.

I received an offer letter a few days later along with a call from my potential supervisor. I had some questions to ask her and she advised that I should pose them to her supervisor, who seemed confused as to why I would be asking any questions.
