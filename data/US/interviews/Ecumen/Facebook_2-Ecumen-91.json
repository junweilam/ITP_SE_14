Well, the next day merely hours after my meeting everyone I received the standard \"Thanks but no thanks\" stock email stating \"thank you for your interest...but we are looking at other candidates\".  This is usually the response you get when you don't get an in person interview.  I was astounded by this - it was not only impersonal, but very rude.  I emailed two HR people to ask if they had any feedback for me, and I haven't heard one word back.
