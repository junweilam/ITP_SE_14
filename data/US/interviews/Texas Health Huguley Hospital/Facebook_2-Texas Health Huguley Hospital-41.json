I notice the lack of diversity at the hospital, so I'm not sure if this was the reason why I was not selected, which I hope is not the case.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you looking to work here?

After almost 30 minutes of waiting, I emailed them to see what happened. Apparently they got caught up in a meeting or something which I understood because things happen. We rescheduled and all was well. Fast forward to the rescheduled interview and the person called me about 10 minutes late. You'd think they'd put more effort into being on time after missing the first call all together, but I guess not. They didn't even apologize for the tardiness. That should have been my first warning this wouldn't be the greatest experience. They asked me where I worked, what was my education, etc. Are you not looking at the resume I took the time to send in and also duplicate into your online form?  They reached the salary question and, shocker, they had a low salary range with no room for negotiation. Not sure why salary wasn't brought up first to avoid wasting anyone's time if you weren't on the same page. They talk about being a faith based organization, but I felt no sort of warmness or respect during the process. The lady seemed bored and was just reading off some script. They probably wanted to hire internally or through a referral so I likely had no real chance anyway. One thing mentioned during the application process was that they \"reward\" employees for referrals. Wouldn't waste time interviewing here unless you were referred by an internal employee.", "Interview Questions": "Where do you work?"}, {"date": "24 Sept 2018", "title": "Physical Therapist Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Texas Health Huguley Hospital (Burleson, TX)", "Interview Descriptions": "A brief phone interview preceded a formal onsite interview.
