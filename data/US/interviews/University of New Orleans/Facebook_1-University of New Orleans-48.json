The interview consisted of a panel of three people including the hiring manager; and it was recorded. I was assigned a task of putting together a training layout for a position that reports to the applied position, but was never compensated for my time. I also had to submit my project which I should\u2019ve locked and watermarked. The interview with the panel went great, and the other two people were extremely nice and responsive, but after a week and a half after the interview I hadn\u2019t heard from the hiring manager. I sent an e-mail and never heard a response until exactly two weeks later when received an e-mail saying I wasn\u2019t selected, but I could apply for the Coordinator 1 position which reports to Coordinator 3 position I interviewed for previously. I was appalled and disgusted. The hard work I put into that project that I was not paid for worth nothing.", "Interview Questions": "What would you do if you have a new tire who does not have training experience?"}, {"date": "4 Jun 2022", "title": "Director Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at University of New Orleans (New Orleans, LA) in Oct 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "Round 1: Phone Interview with Hiring Manager and a small committee \n\nRound 2: All day series of Zoom meetings with different departments and relevant leaders\n\nEveryone was polite and asked good questions, however I had some internet problems and I wonder if that may have affected the quality of the interview.", "Interview Questions": "The one thing that stands out is that I was asked if I had ever had to terminate someone."}, {"date": "4 May 2022", "title": "Desktop Support Technician Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0The process took 4 days.\u00a0I interviewed at University of New Orleans (New Orleans, LA) in May 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview is conducted by the Desktop Support Manager in person.
