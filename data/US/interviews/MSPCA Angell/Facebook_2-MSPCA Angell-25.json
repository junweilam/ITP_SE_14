The interview was not very \"conversational\" and there was very little small talk, he was very down to business.  He mentioned he had interviewed a lot of candidates, and I was the last one.  He would pick three people to go on to the second round of interviews. \r\n\r\nI received a call from him the following week to schedule a second interview.  This time, I met with two people I would be working with directly.  This interview was more conversational and again, there was no prepared interview questions.  This interview took an hour and a half, and I did most of the talking.  They seemed very pleased with me and gave me a tour of the building before I left.  They told me they would get back to me in a week with their final decision.\r\n\r\nAfter a week and a half, I sent an email inquiring about the status of their decision.  They sent me an impersonal, generic email stating that they had decided to move forward with another candidate.  \r\n\r\nI had met or exceeded all of their requirements and had two positive interviews, so I replied to the email, asking what factors influenced their final decision.
