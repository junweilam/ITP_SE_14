Looking back although I felt comfortable and felt the interview questions were easy, it wasn\u2019t very conversational like most interviews I have. They were just taking turns reading questions off a sheet and writing my answers. Here and there I\u2019d get a response to my answers. I really think they already knew who they wanted to hire and were just going through the motions. \r\n\r\nThere were some subtle clues that I didn\u2019t pick up on until after I got rejected like after the interview, no one even walked me back to the elevators or main hallway. They just let me out of the conference room and asked if I knew how to get back myself and then immediately closed the conference door back. So I think they went straight to discussing me/my interview.\r\n\r\nI help with interviewing and hiring candidates at my current job and usually no one is immediately rejected unless they did something specific in the interview that really turned the team off... That could just be my jobs way but if I did do something wrong, I have no clue what it was. That\u2019s why my only other guess is they already knew who they were going to hire and were just going through the motions... again my job doesn\u2019t do that. They don\u2019t bring a lot of people in to interview. Only top choices that they\u2019re pretty sure they want to hire based on resume and phone interview. My job doesn\u2019t like to waste their time or others.\r\n\r\nAnother subtle clue I got was that, when I asked, I was told I\u2019d hear back within a couple of days whether I got the job or not, by email. If they wanted to hire me, it often takes longer than a day or 2 to even get references checked. I just hate when employers waste my time like that because I already have a full time job and have to waste PTO and/or work extra hours to make up the time. I had also let my references know I had an interview and they might be called, which I wish I hadn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nAnother FYI, the campus is huge. Parking can be confusing and you will probably have a long walk from parking to where your interview is. I suggest planning to arrive 30 minutes before the interview start time because it may take that long to find parking and walk to the building. Also, you have to pay for parking and they didn\u2019t validate or reimburse me at all. I\u2019ve NEVER had to pay for parking for an interview.
