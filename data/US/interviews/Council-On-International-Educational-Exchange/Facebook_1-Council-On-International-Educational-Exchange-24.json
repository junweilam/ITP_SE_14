I got the impression that someone was in the room feeding her lines and questions, because there were many long pauses and the conversation did not flow.  She asked me about my previous experience (I'm completely qualified for this position in that I did teach abroad and know the entire experience and process in depth, in addition to being bilingual, and studying, working, and living abroad).  I have even worked for CIEE as a Local Coordinator, and I had to explain to her what that meant.  She asked about my experience using Excel.  I explained that I had been using Excel every day in all of my work experience for at least the past 4 years.  At the end of the interview she said her main concern was my lack of experience with Excel.  WHAT??!  The following day I sent an email thanking her for her time, and I never heard from her.

There were two initial interviews with HR specialists then a VP and the director I would have worked under.  Although the position seemed to be advertised as a Nanjing position one interviewer asked the question if it was in this other city in China would you relocate. It seemed like a test of your dedication kind of question. Some of the arrangement of the interviews took place with only a short window and there was a bit of confusion on interview meeting time.  \r\nGenerally the interviews were professional but other than increase enrollments it seemed they had not formulated exactly the expectations for the what the role would be selling . China has a lot of this \"feel the stones as you cross the river\" kind of practicality so this vagueness did not phase me much, but I could see in other contexts it might be difficult. \r\nFrom talking to some people in the organization it does seem that there is a lot of work for a small team and often evening meetings to suit the US time schedule. \r\n\r\nSeveral interviewers asked \"How will you build good relationships with team members in the US that you will not see often?\" It seemed they did not think this would be easy. \r\n\r\nCIEE seems like a good organization to work for with qualified people.

I was first interviewed by a contracted HR talent recruiter/screener.  I was then told that I had made it to the next round but that because the people involved were really busy, I wouldn't hear from them for several weeks.  That was great news for me, actually, because I too was preoccupied at that time.  Then, suddenly I was contacted for a Skype interview with my would-be supervisor.  That was a bit frustrating and stressful as I had no time to prepare.  That interview took place 14 days after the screening call.  The day after that I was invited to an onsite interview, which took place about 3 weeks later.  \r\n\r\nI would describe the onsite interview experience as \"mixed\".  I was put in a specially set-up interview room to meet 1:1 via video conference with CIEE staff in other countries.  They were pleasant and engaged and had clearly prepared.  I met with several other people 1:1 in the same room in person, each for 30 minutes as well as with three administrators in their offices.  All were collegial.  I enjoyed those sessions greatly.  I was really very interested in the position and they seemed genuinely interested in me.\r\n\r\nHowever, several things about the process were disconcerting. I was not met at the hotel by anyone from CIEE (took a cab on my own to the hotel as planned - no problem), Despite having flown a fair distance for the interview, I ate breakfast at the hotel on my own.  Also, there were mistakes in the interview schedule in terms of the time slots, but the most bizarre thing was that there was no break for lunch built in.  I emailed the HR contact ahead of time to ask about that, but received no response.  So, I packed a snack and made sure I had a big breakfast.  Then, one of the people who interviewed me noticed that I had no break for lunch and had a sandwich ordered for me.  I was put in one of their little interview rooms and left to eat my sandwich alone!  I had exactly 10 minutes to snarf it down.  I also found it very odd that I was not scheduled to meet with either of the other two direct reports (the other people who would have been on the team for which I was applying to be a part) of the supervisor.  And, there was no group interview time, which meant that I answered many of the same questions over and over for each person and also meant that I had no opportunity to understand their group dynamics.  \r\n\r\n10 days after the interview I received an automated, unsigned, generic email from an unmonitored email account indicating they had selected another candidate.  Given the level of the position, the number of interview phases, and the time commitment on my part, this was not a good sign for me regarding the caliber of the organization.  I felt that if I were not contacted by phone, then a personalized email from the person to whom I would have reported would have been appropriate.  Given this way of being notified that I had not been selected, coupled with the many strange elements of the process described above, I would think twice before interviewing with CIEE.\r\n\r\nNB: The day after my interview, the position of one of the would-be team members was announced, which explains why I was not scheduled to meet that person (s/he had already resigned).
