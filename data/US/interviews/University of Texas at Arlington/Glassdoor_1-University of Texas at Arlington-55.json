I would be required to purchase my flight there (I flew from Orlando) but they would cover my food and lodging. I agreed and flew out two weeks later. They failed to remember to pick me up from the airport so I was required to take an Uber and never gave me anything in regards to covering my meals. The only thing that was set up was my lodging at a hotel nearby. \r\n\r\nThey picked me up late from the hotel on the day of my interview and told me that they would reimburse me for my Uber and food expenses as long as I emailed them receipts. After that they took me around campus and I met with a panel of people from the department.  While I was there they asked me several questions which I felt were unprofessional but I was willing to answer. Several of them pertained to me being religious and how that would affect me working the position and if working previously at a religious organization would affect my work. \r\n\r\nAfter the interview they informed me they would follow up with me within the next two weeks, right before Christmas, with their decision. I was told it was down to me and a few other people. December 31st rolled around and I had not heard back from them nor been reimbursed for my expenses.
