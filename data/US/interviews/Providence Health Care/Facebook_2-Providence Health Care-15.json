Shortly after, I was sent a follow-up email and was able to schedule an interview. The interview was 30 minutes long and I was first asked to tell them about myself and my experience. As I was doing that, it seems I didn't have the insurance appeal follow-up experience they were looking for and they wrote me off. They also made the assumption that I didn't have enough work and kept saying over and over how there's a lot of work there and that there's never any downtime. I mentioned that I get what my supervisor calls \"busy work\" and they assumed it meant I wasn't busy enough, which I am, but I NEVER got the chance to elaborate nor did they ask. The thing is that I work quickly and efficiently and still end up needing more work. There were about 9 minutes left of the interview and one of the interviewers wanted to put that out there. They didn't ask me any behavioral questions or anything. I honestly wish these people would just be upfront and honest during the interview and tell me, sorry you don't have the experience we're looking for. I fit all the qualifications within the job description, so it's possible they need to re-vamp the description. I happened to go online on the profile portal to try to cancel another interview I had scheduled because I was scheduled for two beings I applied for 2 positions and that's when I saw that the positions said they are no longer considering me.

It's difficult to ascertain wether an algorithm scans these videos for key words or if a real human watches through them. Prepare by reading through the job posting, some Glassdoor reports on the actual content of the job, and the division's page on the site - if you're professional, prepared, and succinct, you should pass on to the next phase where you'll get some real human interaction.
