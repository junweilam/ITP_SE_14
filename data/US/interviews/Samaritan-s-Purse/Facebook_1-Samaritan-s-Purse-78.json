They said I could never have sex with or live with a man before marriage. I was single and that's personal, so I would never talk about that at work anyway, so okay. They also required a signature claiming that I believe God condemns homosexuality and finds it an abomination. I said I do not judge anyone, including people who feel that way, but I would never believe God finds any of his creations an abomination. The HR recruiter claimed it was a requirement for employment, so I canceled the interview and wished them well.
