Being a queer POC means it's been hard for me to find sustainable work in a workplace that is supportive and affirming to my identities, so I was super excited when Apicha contacted me for an interview. I spoke to one of the employees and we had a nice chat about what the position entails, what I was looking for and my skills etc. I sent a thank you note after our interview and she responded asking me for my references and told me she would reach out to them. I thought this was a great sign and made sure to contact my references and let them know she was reaching out. They informed me that they had completed the reference sheet she had sent, so I know for a fact she got that information. Then....I never heard back from them, completely ghosted me! I emailed the same woman I spoke with multiple times to see if there was any updates. Even receiving a rejection would have been better than absolutely no response. I think it's highly unprofessional and makes your workplace seem disorganized that you can't even send out an automated email just to let people know they haven't been selected. The job market is incredibly difficult right now and even more so for someone at the intersection of my identities. As an organization that is supposed to support people like me I found this incredible disappointing.

I was also asked if I have had any conflicts with supervisors in the past, how I would handle any conflicts with a supervisor if I worked at Apicha, and how I would respond in a situation with a naked, potentially violent client.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the interview I was asked if I would be willing to change my appearance. I was told that my hair was unprofessional, that I did not align with Apicha's image, and that I needed to present myself in a way that I could be seen as a face of the company.\r\n\r\nThe second interviewer attempted to correct their colleague's statements by explaining that I would actually be required to change my appearance for my own protection and safety. They stated that my hair color could be a trigger for certain clients who may react violently and want to rip my hair out.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the position I interviewed for is currently 100% remote. \r\n\r\nAll in all, the interview was difficult to schedule, did not include a standard line of questioning, and ended with antiquated and discriminatory comments about my appearance and professionalism. \r\n\r\nAs an organization that serves and employs members of the LGBTQ community, it is deeply saddening that the diversity in appearance of Apicha's employees would not be reflective of the diversity within the queer community.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that this post serves a purpose and that no applicant, employee, or client will have to endure similar treatment in the future.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us a little bit about yourself.

They were both friendly. One person took more notes while the supervisor asked more of the questions. They challenged me in their questions which I felt was good. I initially applied for a different position than the one they interviewed me for, but they interviewed me for a job that was more challenging and interesting and ultimately a step up from where I was at the time (and what I applied to), but not what I was looking for. There was a writing portion that involved problem solving in different scenarios which was challenging, but I felt prepared for (having worked in a similar position but on a smaller scale) that the interviewers weren't in the room for. There was plenty of room for asking questions. The biggest impression that I got was that they wanted to make sure that I was dedicated to the work, that I could handle challenging situations and problem-solve in the moment, and that they wanted retention (AT LEAST more than a year). They also wanted to make sure that I could grow into the job, even if I hadn't worked at that scale before.
