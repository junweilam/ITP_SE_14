I completed a Zoom panel interview with 3 other people. They sounded excited about me, so I was invited to complete a shadow day in the ICU. I drove from out of town to do this shadow day. When I got there, no one even knew I was coming. I was given a tour of the unit and the unit's protocols were explained to me. Other than that, I sat looking at the walls of the office, because everyone was too busy charting. That night, I drove back home, and I haven't heard from anyone since. It has been 3 months. No one even responded to my follow-up email. This was very unprofessional on the ICU and UAB's part (bad communication seems to be rampant with the ICUs from another past experience). Also, from seeing the unit's lack of diversity in person in terms of your APPs and overall staff, I was never going to get the job anyway.

The interview process for me contained four rounds.  All rounds were very communicative and relationship based.  I felt even more empowered about my new job after every interview and by no means did I feel like I was being drilled or questioned for failure like some interviews go.  The first round I met with the Executive Director of Development, who is my direct supervisor.  This interview was basically to get to know me.  She wanted to know where I was from, what I did in college, what my hobbies were, and how I came across the position and why I chose to apply.  We went over the job description and how my resume/ experience is perfect for the position. We also discussed the next steps in the interview process and how many people I am competing against (6 first round-4 second round -2 third round.)  I killed the interview and at the end she told me to expect a call from her secretary within a day or two.  The second round was about 3 and half hours long.  I met with 5 people total.  I had a one-on-one with a director of development (DOD), then another one-on-one w/ another DOD, and then I had a group interview with a Major Gifts Officer, a Development Officer, and a fellow Development Coordinator.  The first two one-on-ones were very similar to the first interview.  They wanted to get to know me and why I chose UAB and development.  They loved talking about what they do, not in a bragging snobbish kind of way, but in a fulfilling way.  The group interview really got more in to the nitty gritty of the job description.  They talked more heavily and precisely on daily tasks and how the position works.  They were enjoyable people as well.  This interview was conducted in the same building as my previous so I dropped by and gave her my hand-written thank you note and asked my potential boss what the next steps would be.  She said the secretary will follow up within a few days.  The third interview was the toughest.  My interview was the Associate VP of Development and Major Gifts.  I was already heavily recommended by my previous 6 interviewers, so he just wanted to make sure why I chose this career path and if UAB would be a good fit for me.  I originally made it known that I initially wanted to go into marketing so every question was basically phishing around to see if was committed to the job since they are looking for a long term employee.  We talked a lot about personality types and how I would fit in/ how I would interact with patients and doctors, and how everyone would interact with me. The interview was still more relationship based, as I got to know him and how he likes to manage/operate, but it wasn't as relationship based as the other.  By the time I was called back for the fourth round, I already had the position. I was the number one candidate and they did not call anyone else back for the fourth round.  However, I did not know that at the time.  I thought I was still possibly competing with one other person, especially since my third round wasn't as great as I wanted it to be.  The fourth round, unbeknownst to me, was more of a formality than anything.  I met with the Executive Assistant for the Department of Surgery, he is basically the CEO for the department that I would be operating in.  The interview started and my boss, the EDOD, basically told him my qualifications and why I was being chosen. I thought it was going to be another one-on-one, but we all three sat together.  After hearing my qualifications, he just wanted to hear a little about me and then welcomed me to the team.  It was a 15 minute 'interview'.  I got the offer letter the next sent out to me the next day.", "Interview Questions": "After seeing your resume and understanding that you initially tried to go into marketing, why are you now choosing a path in development?"}, {"date": "21 Aug 2015", "title": "Staff RN Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at UAB Medicine (Birmingham, AL) in Jan 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "Met with the Unit manager and she introduced me to key staff, showed me the unit.
