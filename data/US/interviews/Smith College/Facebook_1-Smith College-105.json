The last group talked badly about the person I would be reporting to (red flag) and how if I was offered the position to negotiate (the word negotiate was thrown out about ten times).

I didn't hear anything back after two weeks, so I sent a follow up e-mail and left a voicemail. Still nothing. I reached out to HR via e-mail and voicemail. Still nothing. A few weeks later, I called HR and left a message with a secretary who promised to have someone call me back with information (even though I had long since given up on this job). I never received any call back from HR. I'm not even joking, but I finally got the rejection letter from HR eight months after the interview. The rejection letter even began with \"We are sorry that this process has taken so long\". What excuse could they possibly have for taking eight months to reject someone? I had seriously been at my new job for 6 months before this rejection letter appeared in my inbox. The PI could have at the very least let me know sooner that I did not make the final selection.
