When they finally dialed in, we'd lost 15 minutes and they said they had a hard stop at the end of the scheduled time. Instead of trying to reschedule they tried to fit everything into 15 minutes. Most of our time was spent with them explaining the company, and maybe 5 minutes of me answering questions.\r\n\r\nSomehow that got me to the third round despite the odd previous call. Round 3 was with someone from Marketing who seemed unimpressed from the start. He explained more about the job and I finally learned what product they want a candidate for, and I could tell from the talk that they needed someone *immediately* - their entire onboarding was scheduled for 3 days before launching into major work. The call was tough mostly because I didn't know what kind of product work to prep for.  \r\n\r\nFollowing round 3 was a lot of silence, then a recruiter letting me know they wanted to \"pause\" my application.

They were very busy with preparations for their upcoming annual conference and dealing with a big client issue (precisely the kind of issue that they were looking for this position to solve), so the interviews were somewhat rushed and distracted, but I felt they went well overall and I was very excited about the potential of the opening, as the duties were an excellent match for my experience and abilities. I was told that they intended to move quickly on the hire, though the person vacating the position had a soft end date, and that there were three other candidates, one internal. I emailed a thank you note that day and received a polite response. Two weeks later I emailed a follow-up query to check on the status of the hire, and was told that they had not made an offer yet but hoped to by end-week.
