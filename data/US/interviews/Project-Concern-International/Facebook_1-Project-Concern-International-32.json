This was very simple, asking basic questions about qualifications, salary expectations, language proficiency, etc. If you read the job description thoroughly, you'll see a couple target skills that you'll likely be asked about but, again, it is basic questioning and nothing in-depth. The entire interview lasted no more than 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe second interview was with the Director of the unit. The interview was relaxed and felt more like a conversation between colleagues than an interview. The breadth of discussion, while seemingly informal, was comprehensive and delved deeply into professional experiences, technical understanding of the work, and personal development goals. This interview was just over one hour.\r\n\r\nThe third interview was a written assessment. The aim of the assessment was to test communication skills, understanding of the field, and professionalism. There were three parts to the assessment and a quick deadline for turnaround. \r\n\r\nThe fourth interview was again with the Director of the unit. This interview was more structured. It went over the written assessment and additional questions stemming from it. Additionally, work styles and preferences were discussed. This interview lasted just over one hour.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and final interview was with one of the VPs. This interview was much more in-depth, lasting nearly two hours, and covered everything from professional experience to international travel to a discussion on why PCI versus another agency. This interview required you to defend your experience in relation to the position and discuss any deficiencies or gaps against what you can bring.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after the final interview, HR responded with a final Q&A and offer letter.", "Interview Questions": "Nothing was out of the realm of expectation, with the exception of one question: If you had a superpower, what would it be and how would it make you do your job better?

It consisted of multiple parts. The questions were pretty straight-forward, nothing too surprising. However, there are two things that need to change. First, the hiring/interview team needs to get back to candidates in a timely manner. I found the way they conducted themselves to be unprofessional and rude. Second, if PCI does not want to hire someone based on a lack of skills and/or experience (which were never advertised in the job listing to begin with), do not continue leading the candidate through the interview process!
