What a complete waste of time, then I find out they hired a candidate with no higher education background what so ever. She has only been in higher education for less than five months and has no experience in the position she was hired for what so ever.  As well the candidate is an Alumni, so what I am trying to say is if you want to work for Marist you need to be an alumni because  I have a Master's degree with 5 plus years of experience and they went with an Alumni who has ZERO higher ed experience and no Master's degree.
