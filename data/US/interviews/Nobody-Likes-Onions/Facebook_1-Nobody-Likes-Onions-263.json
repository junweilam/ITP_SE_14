Nowadays, nobody can see anybody before filling out an application online and answering a HUGE amount of questions.  You go to any of these stores and the Manager says, \"You will have to apply at our website!  I cannot help you get a job here!\"  When you go to the website you get this super LONG amount of questions that you answer.  With Home Depot you can apply for many jobs a once.  \r\nThen a person from Atlanta calls you and asks you a bunch of questions on a job that can barely pay the gas to the store...LOL!  \r\nThen the Manager is forced to call you if you meet the requirements of the job and give you an Interview. \r\nOne can tell that the Manager is disgusted with this whole process also.  This is something that a Human Resource person used to do!  These Upper Management people have delegated everything to a few people by these companies continually Downsizing and Decreasing Pay for more work, except the greedy Upper Management themselves!  The Manager who is paid 400 times less than a greedy Upper Manager sits down with you with this Big Book of questions to ask you. \r\nWhen you are done the Manager is really as disgusted as you are, you get the idea that they do not have much of a say in hiring you or not.", "Interview Questions": "What was you biggest mistake and what did you do about it?
