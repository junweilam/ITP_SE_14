They called me in to an interview with HR and one other employee. The decision maker did not even come out of his office to interview me. They asked me straight up if I was a Christian. They said they would notify me if I get the job. They called me several weeks later, saying they offered it to someone else, but that two new positions at HQ had opened, which I could try for. The positions are not what I wanted to do, but I want to work in this field, so I agreed . The HR lady is a bit aloof - my MOU is some strange looking template with a weird font. I thought it was all very haphazard. Legal hiring practices and questions certainly don't seem to apply.", "Interview Questions": "Are you a Christian and do you believe in cooperating with the Christian ethics of this organization."}], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
