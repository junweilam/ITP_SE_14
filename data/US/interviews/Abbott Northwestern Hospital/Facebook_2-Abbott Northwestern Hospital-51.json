Second with manager. They said that was it, no in person interviews. Then, recruiter emailed me that by the end \"of the week\" we will have \"more to come\" since I was considered for four open positions. No follow up email. Contacted recruiter several times and the answer was always the same: \"Oh, I'm so sorry; I know the manager is so super busy these days. I'll reach out to her and see what is the response.\" This went on for several weeks. I decided to withdraw since it was obvious the recruiter was acting very fake and candy coating the fact that a strong lack of communication existed between the two management levels. The overly fake response by the recruiter was very stupid and immature. The interview was scheduled about a month after the application and resume were submitted. Quite obvious the over all corporation has a real lack of communication. The experience was only a prelude as to what I could imagine being an employee.", "Interview Questions": "Using the STAR approach (S for Situation, T for Task, A for Action and R for result) how did you handle a difficult customer?

I sat and waited maybe 10-15 minutes passed the scheduled time when I was approached by the supervisor.  We went back to the office and again it was more of a laid back feel.
