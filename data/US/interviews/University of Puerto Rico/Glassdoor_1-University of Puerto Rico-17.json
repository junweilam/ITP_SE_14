They would rate me in terms of speed, accuracy, etc. Once I handed in my translation, I was asked to go home while they compared and read through the paragraphs other interviewees and myself handed in.\r\n\r\nThankfully, I was informed that I got the job that very same afternoon! And I've been there since.",
