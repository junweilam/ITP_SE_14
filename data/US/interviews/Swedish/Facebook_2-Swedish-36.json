I recieved an email 4 weeks later asking to set up a phone interview. The interview was set for about a week out. I rearranged my current work schedule to get off work early enough to complete the phone interview. I left work early that day and arrived home with about 20 minutes to spare to review my notes before the phone call. I looked at my phone only to realize HR had called me 30 minutes prior to my scheduled interview and left a VM saying if I was still interested to call and/or email. I immediately checked my email to make sure I didn't mess up on the time and sure enough, I was not the one who made the mistake. I called back right away and the call went to voicemail. I left a professional message apologizing for missing her call and explained I was still very interested in the position.  I figured maybe she would realize her mistake and call me at the correct time. 4pm (the agreed upon phone interview) came and went. My heart sank. I emailed around 4:30 once again apologizing and looking to reschedule. HR got back to me the following business day but explained she couldn't reschedule me for another week and a half. Okay, I really wanted the job so I patiently waited for the interview. I emailed a day prior to confirm our time. This time, she called at the correct time. She asked about my previous experience,  had 3 behavioral based questions for me, and asked if I had any questions. I had several questions, all of which she said she didn't know the answer and said I would have to ask at the in person interview. She then told me if she felt I met the qualifications she would forward my application to the hiring manager, but an in person interview would be at least a week and a half out. She also informed me they do a 10-panel drug screen (totally fine I guess) which included nicotine and alcohol. I'm sorry, it just seems ridiculous. I realize the hiring process can take time but several months? And a drug test for nicotine and alcohol? I've never even heard of that. This organization seems very disorganized, HR doesn't own up to their mistakes (somehow I felt guilty for missing HR's phone call when they screwed up the time), and a bit intrusive for drug testing for totally legal substances. This seems so be a sign and maybe speak to the bigger picture. Sorry Swedish, I don't want to work for you guys that bad.

I did the in person about a week later and didn\u2019t hear anything, but checked in after a week. I was told the hiring manager hadn\u2019t made a decision. I expressed I was still interested but also interviewing for other jobs. I checked in once more after it had been about 3 weeks and was asked to come in again for a second interview with a different supervisor. This was a waste of my time.  I was there maybe 10 minutes.  I\u2019m the first interview they asked almost all the same questions as the video interview. The second interview the supervisor asked me a couple of the same and said I\u2019d hear something by a set date. That date came and I reached out. I had received a couple of job offers but wanted to weigh all my options so I was holding out. I asked them to let me know if I was no longer being considered so I could move on. They dragged me along for more days before I finally pulled the plug. Ludicrous amount of time (2 months) for a fairly entry level position. Communication was poor and disrespectful of my time.
