Found out within one week & a half that I did not recieve job. First was phone, then in person manager meeting, then meeting with super visor & manager. After final meeting found out I did not get job the next day. Which I really respected, & appreciated. This was a dialysis biomedical technician position which payed significantly below market value while also limiting the opportunity to become biomed II, or biomed III one day  as this role allowed for no chance of advancement. If you have a biomed degree I suggest you look else where. If you have a biomed degree & 1 year or more experience I strongly suggest you look else where. If you have a degree & two years or more experience I would say dont even waste your time. You would be better suited as a traditonal clinical engineer biomed  with the pay to match. Also was just one other tech to be responsible for all the machines at the location I interviewed for. If you are out of a job & just looking to pay some bills this would be perfect to bide your time while you found a better job. Luckily for me my dad always told me to save my money which I did & I have 5 years living expenses saved so I can afford to wait for the perfect role.

I received the call on time, although the person calling was not the person I was supposed to be interviewing with. She began telling me about the position, which was one of the positions I had applied for, but the job turned out to be far below my capabilities and pay grade (basically cleaning animal rooms). The description was not what I applied for, since I had chosen research positions. When asked if it was something I was interested in, I politely informed her that I was not interested in that position based on the terms she described, but that I had over 7 years of research experience, a bachelor's degree, and was a certified technician. I told her that I applied for research positions and wanted to know the status of those applications. She was polite and so I was polite in return..up until now! \r\n\r\nTo this inquiry she responded (in a newly cool tone of voice), \"No, you need a masters degree to be doing things like that. And the next time you apply for a position with us, you need to actually be reading the job descriptions so that this doesn't happen again.\" \r\n\r\nWHAT?? \r\n\r\nShe insinuated that I had just wasted her time by applying for jobs I wasn't actually going to be interested in. I replied that I had in fact applied for the jobs which listed my qualifications, which was actual research. She replied, \"Well if they WERE interested in you, they would have called you.\" That was the end of the conversation.\r\n\r\nI was taken aback at the blatant rudeness. They called a person with a B.S. in Biology, several years of research experience and 3 technician certifications and offer them a job mopping floors for less than half of what they are actually worth in the marketplace. Then when they aren't interested, proceed to insult their intelligence and give them a lecture? That is NOT ok.\r\n\r\nHenry Ford wasted my time by:\r\n\r\nA-Not taking the time to read my resume, and insulting me when they discovered I was overqualified for their position and wasn't interested.  \r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\nB-Reading my resume, and insulting me by disregarding my education, experience and certifications, then lecturing ME about wasting their time. \r\n\r\nI will not be applying for any positions at Henry Ford in the future, ever.
