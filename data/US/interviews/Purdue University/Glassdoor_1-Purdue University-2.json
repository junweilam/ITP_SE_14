Duration: five months from application to notification I was not selected.  Details:  I interviewed for a Lecturer appointment (non-tenure-track, non-research) in the Polytechnic.  I submitted all items listed in the application process.  Due to current Covid-19 restrictions, all interviews were online via Zoom calls.  The 1st interview was about three months after I submitted my application.  It was a panel interview with the search team lead and about seven other staff members (Professors, Assistant Professors, Senior Lecturers).  The interview consisted of approximately 10 questions, some of which were not appropriate for the position (questions for tenure-track/research level positions).  About one week after the 1st interview, I was asked to submit a Teaching Philosophy statement because mine was \"missing\".  In fact, I had never been directed to submit one with the application.  Since a Teaching Philosophy statement is not common in the commercial world,  I created what was requested on short notice and submitted it ahead of the deadline.  I was then invited to a 2nd round of interviews scheduled about four months after I applied.  The first was a mock on-line training event with the search team lead and approximately 10-15 staff members posing as students.  Due to miscommunication, I was originally asked to present my past and current research experience, and my future research plans (as if this was a tenure-track/research position).  After an opportunity to ask questions in advance of the presentation, I was told I had been given incorrect information.  In fact, I was to select any technical topic of my choice and present it, to be followed by a question and answer period.  What I later learned is what was really desired was a presentation specifically to discuss one subject area taught by the school which I would then supplement with my personal work experience.  Had I known this in advance, I would have prepared a more effective presentation.  The final interview of the 2nd round was a 30-minute, one-on-one Zoom call with one of the leaders of the Polytechnic.  We discussed my resume, work experience, and what I could bring to the university to help it achieve its goals for a transformative learning experience.

Duration: five months from application to notification I was not selected.  Details:  I interviewed for a Lecturer appointment (non-tenure-track, non-research) in the Polytechnic.  I submitted all items listed in the application process.  Due to current Covid-19 restrictions, all interviews were online via Zoom calls.  The 1st interview was about three months after I submitted my application.  It was a panel interview with the search team lead and about seven other staff members (Professors, Assistant Professors, Senior Lecturers).  The interview consisted of approximately 10 questions, some of which were not appropriate for the position (questions for tenure-track/research level positions).  About one week after the 1st interview, I was asked to submit a Teaching Philosophy statement because mine was \"missing\".  In fact, I had never been directed to submit one with the application.  Since a Teaching Philosophy statement is not common in the commercial world,  I created what was requested on short notice and submitted it ahead of the deadline.  I was then invited to a 2nd round of interviews scheduled about four months after I applied.  The first was a mock on-line training event with the search team lead and approximately 10-15 staff members posing as students.  Due to miscommunication, I was originally asked to present my past and current research experience, and my future research plans (as if this was a tenure-track/research position).  After an opportunity to ask questions in advance of the presentation, I was told I had been given incorrect information.  In fact, I was to select any technical topic of my choice and present it, to be followed by a question and answer period.  What I later learned is what was really desired was a presentation specifically to discuss one subject area taught by the school which I would then supplement with my personal work experience.  Had I known this in advance, I would have prepared a more effective presentation.  The final interview of the 2nd round was a 30-minute, one-on-one Zoom call with one of the leaders of the Polytechnic.
