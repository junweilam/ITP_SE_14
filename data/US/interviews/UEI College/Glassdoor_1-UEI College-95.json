I was under the impression that I would be the only one coming in for an interview, but there were several people getting interviewed for the same position.  After waiting until everyone showed up, all of us were sent into a computer room and asked to sit down. There we met Robert Pope the \"Campus President\", he stated out of all of the people who were in the room there were only 3 open positions. He described the position which is pretty much a sales job and asked all of us to fill out scenario-based questions.  The whole process seemed to sketch and unsettling. As people turned in their papers we were called in one at a time for a one on one interview. However, this was a panel interview with two female Admission Reps. The energy they gave off was fake and the interview was rushed.

If you have integrity and you don't want to scam young vulnerable people into taking out loans, then find something else.
