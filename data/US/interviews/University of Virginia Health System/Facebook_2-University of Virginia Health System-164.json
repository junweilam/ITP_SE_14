In addition, the hiring manager was not communicative so I was left in the dark about the status of my candidacy the entire time. From the get-go, they had contacted me to set up an interview and then I didn't hear back for weeks.  Finally, I heard back to schedule a 3-hour panel interview with 4 different groups of people. The interview process was very long  with no break for lunch.  Upon arriving at each panel interview, each person from the panel asked a typical behavioral question. Behavioral questions are listed on HR's website but there are ~100 or so, so it's difficult to prep. Some of them were from left-field and did not really seem to apply to the position I had actually interviewed for. Also, the panelists barely asked me questions about whether I would be able to actually perform the job.  Finally I had the interview with the hiring manager who seemed frazzled and barely looked at me during the process.  He couldn't provide much information on follow-up, except that they were interviewing more people and if I didn't hear from him in a few weeks to get in contact with him. I never heard from him again, and after trying to contact him twice with no response assumed I did not get the job. I finally contacted HR who informed me the offer had been made to someone else.  Overall, the entire interview process was disorganized. Moreover, they treated me disrespectfully as I had to take off an entire day from work to drive out there and then couldn't even follow up afterwards about my status. In my opinion, it seems like they must have had an internal candidate and only interviewed me per policy requirements.   I just had an  interview with another company, and although a slow process, the HR reps communicated with me the entire way throughout the interview process. UVA Pharmacy could definitely improve their interviewing process and maintain transparency with the candidate throughout.
