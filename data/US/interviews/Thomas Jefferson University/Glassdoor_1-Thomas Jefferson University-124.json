About the time the interview was supposed to start, one of the women I was supposed to be meeting with stopped in to heat up her lunch in the microwave that was in the conference room. So we have a first impression of an organization with the interviewers running late, being placed into an awkward room, and one of them making lunch.\r\n\r\nWhen the interview began, about 10 minutes late, 2 of the 3 women acted like they didn't have a care in the world. One woman was chewing gum and although she tried to mask it it was obvious it was there. Another woman, and the gum chewing woman, were on their phones as well. I doubt it was about business as they were both smiling every time they looked up from their phones. Even if business was urgent you'd think that a 15-20 minute interview that was set up would mean that you just don't look at it for that period of time. I wondered if they were making comments about me or just talking about what was on TV that night? In my eyes it was rude and unprofessional that I took the time to dress and play the part and they didn't seem to care.\r\n\r\nI then met with 2 other women who were a delight but they, along with the other prior 3, didn't seem like they were fit to handle an interview. There really wasn't much behavioral interviewing going on so I doubt they found much out about my background. I had emailed all of the people I had interviewed with a never received a response back.
