I received a call from the recruiter first, then did a zoom interview, and then did a half a day of in person interviews. It took 4 months from application to the in-person round of interviews. The in-person interviews involved nine different people. After interviewing, I was told that I would hear something within 2 weeks. FIVE weeks later, I reached out to inquire if they had filled the position, and then I finally received an automated message back, stating they had selected a different candidate. Four months later, I received an invite \"encouraging\" me to apply for essentially the same job in another part of the University. I did apply, and quickly received an automated message back saying that my application was not selected for advancement. I was confused why I was encouraged to take the time to apply again, when my application was so swiftly rejected. I guess this is just how their automated system works? After preparing for and spending half a day interviewing in the final round, it would have been nice to have received at least a personal note of some kind saying I was not selected. I was not expecting this impersonal approach from an institution of this caliber, especially when many of the interview questions were centered around building relationships.
