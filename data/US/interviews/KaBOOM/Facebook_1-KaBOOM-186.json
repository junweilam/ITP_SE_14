This was very frustrating since I blocked out times that she suggested, only to never get a confirmation from her. We finally conducted the phone interview and I haven't heard anything since. Kaboom is a good organization and it's unfortunate that they've secured an unprofessional organization to handle their recruiting.

I liked that I was working with a member of the business unit and not HR from the perspective that they know the job and are personally qualified to review my qualifications.  However, I also found it odd that a formal HR/recruiting process seemed to be lacking.  The in-person interview went well, but when I asked what next steps were, the person I asked (the decision maker) didn't know and it was obvious he hadn't even thought about it or discussed it with his team.  He said, \"I know what I want to do and I think we'll have a decision next week.\"  It's now 5 weeks later and my 4 follow up emails (2 to him, 2 to my POC on his team), and 2 phone messages (1 to each) have been summarily ignored.  This is be highly unprofessional and rude in general, but particularly from business development professionals who should know better.  I have since heard (from this site as well as word of mouth) so many bad things about the way KaBOOM! does business and how they treat employees so I guess my experience is just insight to who they are.
