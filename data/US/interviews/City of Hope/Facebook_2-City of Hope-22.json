HR called me the next day, and after describing the benefits the representative said that they had not decided on a salary for the position yet, and that they would get back to me as soon as they figured that out.  A week later, HR emailed me to let me know that another candidate was hired instead.  I was surprised, and I felt like I had been led on.  I don't think HR should have discussed the benefits with me nor told me they were working on a salary if they were not sure I was the candidate they would offer the job to.
