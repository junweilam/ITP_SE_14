At the end of the interview they wanted me to meet with the CEO but didn\u2019t know when he would be available. I was asked to wait in the area for an hour so they could call me to schedule that appointment. I waited for over an hour and then reached out. Reception was unable to get ahold of anyone from the panel I had met to ask what was going on. I didn\u2019t get a call until over two hours after my interview ended. When I didn\u2019t answer, the person did not leave VM but proceeded to call a few more times and then leave a VM. This was all a huge red flag for me.

When I was answering the questions, she kept cutting me off and kept asking other questions. I did not feel welcomed by her at all and she did not seem personable. Gee and she did not even write my answers down, she was just asking questions from the top off her head.  One thing that also annoyed me was she kept saying that the position I applied for is the same as my current position now when it totally isn't. Out of all the interviews I have been through, this one was the WORST! Be professional and show that you care for crying out loud. It goes both ways, the interviewer and the interviewee should both be professional,  welcoming and personable, and knowledgeable.
