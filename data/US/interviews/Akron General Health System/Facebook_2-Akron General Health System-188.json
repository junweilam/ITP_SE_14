Nor did I actually get to interview with the manager that I was scheduled to interview with, it was someone else. So I go to this interview expecting to answer typical interview questions..which I did.. but I had no resume for a 2nd Interview nor did the person actually conducting the interview have a copy of my resume or any of my   info from interview 1.\nI feel as though I was robbed of the opportunity of working for this company due to the fact that there was a lack in communication between HR and the Manager on the floor. My 20 plus years experience didn't matter to the person that I wasn't scheduled to interview with...but had to because the actual manager was not available.
