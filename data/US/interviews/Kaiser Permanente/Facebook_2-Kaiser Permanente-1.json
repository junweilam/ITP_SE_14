The phone interview was basically a conference call with 2 individuals (who were not even in the same state). Both people were late to the conference call. It probably was about 7 minutes into the scheduled time before we actually started the interview. The interviewers did not seemed prepared. They were talking over each other and even interrupting me while I was answering questions. It was definitely one of the worst interviews I have ever had, and I was surprised to get a call back. \r\n\r\nThe in person interview was a very similar experience. All of the interviewers (5 people) were late. I was sitting in the room with the secretary for about 5-7 minutes before anyone showed up, and even then only 1 person showed. The rest of the panel eventually showed up, but took some time to set up as I sat there in silence. One of the individuals had to call 2 other people over a video conference so they can join in on the interview. \r\n\r\nAs the interview started, the interviewers, again, were talking over each other. All of them tried to fire off their questions, as other people were asking their questions. It was difficult to figure out who to answer or how to answer questions. While answering one person's question, someone would interrupt me and ask me another question (sometimes not even related to the first question). I would have to then choose to either finish answering the first question or answer the new question. This really threw me off my game. \r\n\r\nMoreover, while answering questions, 2 of the interviewers were constantly on their phones. Scrolling through messages, answering emails or texts, and just simply not engaging with the interview. Those same individuals left the interview in the middle of the interview. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I was never notified if I was selected for the position. It wasn't until I emailed the recruiter to inquire about my candidacy, that I was told they have already filled the position. \r\n\r\nKaiser seems like a great company to work for, and I hope this is just an exception to what usually happens.

I was told that a successful \"fit interview\" would lead to them flying me out for an in-person interview. They contacted me afterwards and asked me about my availability for an in-person interview and I provided the information. There was a delay in hearing from them. I reached out. The talent selection specialist said the Director wanted to speak with me before booking the travel and that I should expect a phone call from him. After two days, I had not received a phone call. The talent selection specialist reached out to inform me that they had decided to make an offer to someone else and that they would be in touch if this person declined. The person ended up declining a few days after and they asked me if I was still interested, but I had already accepted another job offer. I thought this job might have been a good fit. I would have appreciated the Director actually reaching out like I was told he would.

Applied in March of 2014 and was offered the job in May - started in June.  Simply filled out application online at kaiser career website.  I attached a resume and cover letter that was specialized to the job posting.  Received an email about a week later at about 6pm on a Sunday, and as I was reading it the HR lady called to let me know she had just emailed me (they wanted a response by the next day).  She asked me to fill out a two page questionnaire.  Pretty standard - lots of behavioral questions (i.e. Tell us about a time when you had to compromise or work with a difficult employee) and why do you want to work for Kaiser, as well as salary expectations and assurance that commuting would not be an issue.  I sent it in that night, and on Tuesday a manager from Kaiser called to request a phone interview.  A week later I did an hour long phone interview with the two managers.  It was a great interview - they clearly had read my stuff and were contacting me because they thought my experience fit very well.  The interview was a nice conversation.  \r\nThe next day, the manager called back and scheduled my on-site interview with the same two managers as well as the executive director.  This took place about a week later.  Fairly laid back; good conversation.  Discussed what I was looking for in a job and how my experience fit the current job description.  Was a nice conversation with occasional requests for examples of when I'd dealt with certain issues.  \r\nThe next day the manager emailed to schedule a meeting with just me and the vice president.  He was on vacation so it was scheduled for nearly 3 weeks out.  I went in and he was a lot more difficult - not as open or friendly.  He seemed to be frustrated with work and employees, but had lots of work to do.  He did most of the talking.  I tried to chirp in to explain how I could rectify the issues he complained about, but it was difficult.   \r\nI sent thank you cards to all involved in in-person interviews.  A week later when I hadn't heard anything I emailed the manager to request a status, and she said that HR would be contacting me soon to inform me of their decision.  This was on a Friday.  The next Thursday HR called to offer the job.  On the phone they told me pay and basic employment package to make sure I would accept, and they offered more than I requested so I accepted, and then they informed me of next steps.  Their hiring process is pretty difficult.  I had to do a drug test within 48 hours and then submit an application for a background check - which is thoroughly checked out.  They called everyone - including the job I worked for for 3 weeks in college.  Then they asked for 5 year old W9 tax forms.  They are definitely not messing around with background check so make sure all of your stuff is in order and correct - Kaiser HR was quick to inform me that if anything could not be verified the job offer would be rescinded.  \r\nThankfully after a week the background check went through and I started getting my next steps packet for first day orientation and all that!  As I said, extensive process but never terribly difficult - it all felt pretty natural and well set up.

I went on a two trip immediately following my interview so I received an email while there that they'd like to bring me in for an interview with the director of the department. In hindsight, I realize this was less an interview with her and more of a confirmation and offer of the job. It reviewed what I discussed in the previous interview and she also asked if this job really fit my passions, which happen to be very different from the daily activities for the job. While this was true, I wanted to the job so I was somehow able to link the fundamentals of my passion to the job. My position is technically contracted, so there was no room to ask for more than what I was offered, which was $13.50/hr with little mileage reimbursement. The director described the work environment as \"work hard, play hard\" and it seemed to ring true as all employees in the department except director are under 35.

The teams have very different functions and personalities.  On the project management team the interview consisted of an initial phone interview listening for people skills and basic project management skills.  If you make it past that you are called into a group interview.  This usually consists of the manager and two of the project managers from the team.  The group interview is very unstructured.  Just be yourself and ask about what projects they have in the pipleline that you might be getting.  The projects vary vastly so make sure it's something you want to do.

I got an interview with the hiring manager.  One of the first questions within 5 minutes of the interview starting was we work a lot of hours, does that bother you!  I took it to mean that we work 60 hours a week and weekends also whenever necessary.  I made it past that interview and did four phone interviews over the next few weeks, then they had in come in for an additional four interviews. Clearly they hire through consensus or the director of IT finance just cannot make up his mind.  After that nothing for a few more weeks.  When I followed up, I was told they felt that the candidates they had were all over qualified and they were re-writing the posting and starting again.  As a manager, I would take a person who is more qualified and have some bench strength rather than a person who can just do the job.  If everyone in your department is working in access of 60 hours a week, I would find a way to leverage the over qualified person into a broader role to free up band width. While some feel that they person would be bored if they were over qualified, I think a person with the right work ethic would find other things to do which add value. They strike me as an organization that has grown rapidly and there is a highly level vision of where they want to go but they are lacking a detailed plan.
