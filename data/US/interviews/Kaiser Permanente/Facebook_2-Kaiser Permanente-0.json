Seems like most teams I spoke with were pretty bad (I had at least 10 invites with 3 offers at the end). \r\n\r\nMy advice if you want to go forward: remember this interview goes both ways, would you want to work for that specific hiring manager reading off their screen, dodging communications? And ask if they have experience with having an intern and where that intern is at now, if applicable. I personally would not want to work for a team that is not experienced with intern work.", "Interview Questions": "What is your experience using statistical software (other very similar questions, essentially asking the same thing)?"}, {"date": "6 Apr 2023", "title": "Patient Care Technician Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Kaiser Permanente (Los Angeles, CA) in Mar 2023", "Interview Descriptions": "I got a zoom interview with the unit secretary and I think the other person was the manager.

After answering these questions verbally, the manager informed me to look out for an email invitation for the assessment. The manager also commented, \"most people find the assessment to not be too hard.\" \r\n\r\nFor the SAS assessment, I was asked to access their computer remotely via MS Teams and was provided with some sample data and some questions. I was asked to write a program to answer these questions and was asked to include comments in the program to explain the process I was using. The assessment is fairly straightforward if you have experience with working with dates, aggregation, duplication removal, and merging methods in SAS. There is also an \"extra\" question at the end that is more complicated that is explained as \"optional\" unless you have time left. Your webcam must remain on while you do the assessment. You are permitted to access the internet on your end and look up anything you need to complete your program.\r\n\r\nSome days later, I was informed that I was being invited for a panel interview, and I assumed I had been proficient enough on the assessment for this to happen. The panel interview was conducted by the manager, the director, and a programmer from the group. The director briefly described the department and gave a summary of my CV. The manager described a little more about the department from a programming perspective. They asked me to explain why I was considering this position and what my long-term goals were. They also stated that this was a salaried, non-overtime eligible position, and the work would \"sometimes\" exceed 40 hours. Employee retention and turnover also appears to be an issue, but this is not outright discussed. The manager appeared uncomfortable when asked about work/life balance. \r\n\r\nKP Talent/Recruiting reached out to me some time after that, telling me that I was a 'finalist' for this position and asked me a few other questions about what I hoped to gain from this position. Eventually, they came back and made me a formal offer that I felt was lo. I ended up asking more questions about work hours, including weekends. Although they would not come out and say it outright, it was clear that given the nature of the high-volume/fast-paced work and how it could be difficult to adjust, staff was regularly and not occasionally working well beyond 40 hours, including weekends. Also, they do not appear to really factor experience into the title they offer you. The position is listed as I/II, but they claim that their assessment is what determines who is a level I or II even though their level I description seems like it is written for an entry-level job. Additionally, promoting to level II from level I is not guaranteed. It is quite possible that it might take years or it may never happen due to financial issues. This is something that the manager disclosed, but the talent/recruiting did not convey this. \r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, I ended up declining the offer. This appears to be a position in which experienced individuals are hired at a lower level knowing that they will churn out work for a period of time before getting frustrated and leaving due to the compensation not reflecting the work volume.", "Interview Questions": "1.

Successfully completing the interview is essential to ensuring that eligible clients receive food assistance. Reducing missed interviews reduces the need for households to reapply for benefits and for eligibility workers to reprocess redundant paperwork. Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach to completing interviews, agencies have increased the number of interviews completed within mandated timeframes using the following promising practices.\n\nIncreasing SNAP Interview Completion Rates\nAgencies typically conduct a combination of scheduled and unscheduled, walk-in and telephone interviews. Most agencies allow phone interviews; however, if applicants request an in-person interview, the state must still offer it. In general, SNAP agencies will complete more interviews when they use a flexible interview process that accommodates a household\u2019s schedule and have different options for conducting the interview (phone and in-person). Examples of such flexibility include:\n\nWhen the client is in the SNAP office or on the phone, agencies can conduct the interview while the client is there and available:\n\nIf a client walks into an eligibility office to apply or recertify, conduct a same-day interview while the client is in the office.\nIf clients can apply or recertify over the phone (using a telephonic signature), conduct the interview while the client is on the phone to complete the whole process in one step.\n\nNote: only state/county eligibility workers can conduct interviews, which may have implications for call center staffing.\n\nAgencies can also conduct an unscheduled interview by trying to reach the client or allowing the client to call the SNAP office at their convenience.\n\nWhen an application or recertification is received, make a cold call to see if the client is available right then to complete the interview. Contact information is most likely to be accurate closer to the date of application.\nClients may screen calls. Some agencies have found it effective to leave a messagesaying why they are calling and then try calling again in a few minutes. To increase the likelihood that clients pick up the call, agencies will want to be sure that the caller IDcorrectly notes the state agency vs. a general number or \u201cblocked caller.\u201d\nSend a text messageto let the client know that a caseworker will be calling soon to conduct the interview.\nMake multiple calls at different times over a few days to try to reach the client.\nUse a call-in model, where clients are instructed to phone a call center to complete their interview within a certain number of days after submitting their application or recertification. These are referred to as \u201con-demand\u201d interviews.\nStates may get an on-demand interview waiver to conduct all interviews on-demand or can use a call-in model without a waiver by still scheduling an interview time but offering the client the option of calling in any time before the scheduled interview.\nState Spotlight\nNew York City On-Demand Interviews\n\nThe New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) identified eligibility interview challenges, including that 20 percent of SNAP applications were denied for missed interviews and that excess staff time was spent scheduling and rescheduling interviews. In response, HRA piloted on-demand interviews for SNAP recertifications and created new outreach materials \u2014 an online message instructing clients to call for their interviews after submitting their recertification form, along with emails, texts, and robocalls reminding clients to call in for their interview. Clients are instructed to complete their recertification form online or at a local office and then call the SNAP Interview Phone Line to complete their interview. During the pilot, HRA saw an increase in the number of interviews completed at recertification and a decrease in agency workload from scheduling, rescheduling, and making multiple attempts to reach the client by phone. Following success with the recertification interviews, HRA expanded on-demand interviews to new applicants.\n\nIf the agency schedules an interview:\n\nAllow clients to select an interview time that works for them through a mobile app or online portal rather than assigning them a time.\nSend a text reminder before the scheduled interview.\nFor SNAP recertification interviews, call clients at the scheduled time even if they have not returned their recertification form to conduct the interview and remind them to send in their recertification form.\nMaking the Most out of SNAP Interviews\nInterviews are an opportunity for SNAP agencies to clarify information reported on applications or recertification forms, collect verification documents, and answer client questions. Agencies can make the most out of the client interview by:\n\nTrying to resolve all verification issues during the interview.", "Interview Questions": "Medicaid Strategy planning and sonstructive implementation."}, {"date": "20 Nov 2021", "title": "Audiologist Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0I interviewed at Kaiser Permanente (Oakland, CA)", "Interview Descriptions": "Very standard interview.

The interview was completed with three interviewers and one other intern candidate. Very casual and only took about 30 minutes. They told me that the position was technically hybrid, but I would only have to go into the office in Pasadena about once a week and that they would assign me to a team based off availability. \n\nTwo weeks later they contacted me with an offer. They gave me 24 hours to accept or decline the offer. I initially accepted. \n\nAbout a month later, they assigned me to a team and I emailed my manager about the logistics of the internship. I did not hear back from her for 3 weeks, even after I followed up several times. About 4 days before the internship begins they reply saying I need to be in their Glendale office (which was not the office specified in the interview and is about 20 minutes further than the original Pasadena one) at least 4 times a week. I email back saying I was under the impression that I would only have to go in once a week, not 4, and that I did not have the money to do the hour drive almost every day of the week.  I also asked if there was any way that we could work something out. Finally, on the Friday before I am due to start the internship I get a call from a different manager (that I had no previous contact with before) asking why I want to withdraw from the position. \n\nTo be clear I never said I wanted to withdraw from the position, but the manager that gave me a call said that they were pushing for her to just rescind my internship offer without even giving me a chance to speak and clear things up. She was nice enough to offer to try to smooth things over for me, but I decided that this internship and workplace was not worth my time. I ended up declining the offer (which probably didn't matter because they were planning on rescinding it anyways). \n\nOverall, I would say I had a horrible experience with this branch of Kaiser. The managers ghosted me for about a month, so I had little to no information about the logistics of the internship, and the hiring manger was unwilling to even try to discuss the problem with me. Rather than reaching out to me and trying to talk things through, the managers decided to just go ahead and rescind my internship offer, which I feel was very rude and unprofessional. They made me feel very unsupported, and frankly unwelcome, which is not something I would ever want in a company. \n\nWith that being said, this was only my experience with one region of Kaiser, I'm sure it's very different in other branches.

As in many places, the phone interview is the first in a series of interviews. The phone interview came across as very poor. The interviewer was difficult to understand over the phone due to a thick accent, and the interviewer made no effort to make their department the least bit attractive to a potential candidates. Even when a reference was made to a publication that the interviewer co-authored, the interviewer showed no interest whatsoever and chose not to comment. To be perfectly honest, it sounded like the department likely already had candidates in mind and was just going through the interview process to look fair. The interview was incredibly dry. After asking questions about statistical analyses, the interviewer then admitted that a \"junior biostatistician\" (this is how the interviewer referred to the position) would spend most of their time extracting and cleaning data and doing very little analysis. Then why is this title called biostatistician? Additionally, this position was titled \"Biostatistician I/II-Epidemiologic Research\". Although such positions usually overlap, such departments should understand that those with epidemiologic training will have a different perspective than those who are trained in biostatistics. The interviewer appeared to have a biostatistics bias. Also, not everyone is going to come from a place with a sophisticated setup where SAS directly connects to SQL server, so it should not be a big deal if you haven't done that before. At some places, you have to write the SQL yourself in separate system, manually save the extracted data into excel files, and write a macro in SAS to mass import them.\r\n\r\nSome time after the initial interview, I received a message asking me to schedule a 2-hour long \"biostats assessment\". Once again, the first interviewer, who was a biostatistician, informed me that this \"junior\" position was not going to involve much analysis and was going to be mainly data extraction, cleanup,  and manipulation. If that was the case, why was there any need for a two-hour long biostatistics assessment?", "Interview Questions": "1. Define incidence and prevalence.\r\n2.

Spent about 20 minutes on the phone interview and concluded by asking me to provide work samples and a copy of my performance review. I sent an excel and access file with dummy data showcasing some of my analysis and formulary skills along with an abbreviated summary of my last performance review as that is confidential information and none of Kaiser\u2019s business in terms of applying for a job. I was then invited to do a video interview the following week with the hiring mgr via Microsoft Teams. Due to technical difficulties with the video conferencing software, I was not able to get video working despite verifying that my webcam was on and functioning at the time. I later come to find out that Microsoft Teams is known for glitching and does not allow one to test camera view prior to start of a meeting. Despite that, I ended up speaking to the same hiring mgr again for an hr and getting asked the same questions again, interrogating me on why I want to leave my current role and if I was trying to run away from something at my current job, and him insisting again for a copy of my performance review. I was then asked to complete a 1-hr timed excel test the next day which I completed in 40 minutes. Next I was invited to speak to a team member over the phone the following week. This lady seemed uninterested and unmotivated for the entire call and loved to highlight areas I don\u2019t have as opposed to focusing on knowledge/skills I do have that can be beneficial to their team which appears to be lacking in the data analysis area.

As a long time HR professional, I know that great candidates often find other employers who can make decisions at a much faster pace and with far better results.  I had at least five interviews with everyone except the janitor and receptionist. It wasn't just the number of interviews it was weeks long time period in between each one that I found totally unprofessional and unreasonable. I would also send \"thank you\" emails after each interview and receive absolutely no response. In addition, I would receive requests via email or phone late in the evening to show up at an interview early the next morning. If you are working, this may create a huge problem for the candidate and shows that KP hiring managers have NO consideration for your time or find very little value in your time - either way, it doesn't leave a great impression.  Also, during one of my interviews, I asked f there were any pending strikes, and I was assured that the relationships with various unions were \"great\". Not true - the very next day, I received Google alerts that KP unionized employees were in the process of voting for a strike. OK, I felt lied to. Also, the job posted was for an HR Consultant (Employee Relations), however, during the interview process the job suddenly changed to a Labor Relations position. Lastly, they tried to low ball me on the initial Offer in spite of my experience and higher education. Also, they gave me seven days to produce an official transcript and  anyone with common sense or with a degree knows that it takes a bit longer. Based upon that ONE factor, KP rescinded the Offer and refused an unofficial transcript for a job that only REQUIRED a HS diploma. Note that KP rescinded after I gave my current employer a two week notice and after I passed the background, reference check and drug test.  I've been a KP member for over thirty years and so has many of my family members. Based upon this traumatic experience, I would never recommend KP as an employer or HMO provider.

Then followed by another phone interview by a hiring manager who invited for an in person interview. The in-person interview was a 2 1/2 hour long process where I had to do a case study, followed a panel interview with a big group then a smaller panel interview with a Director and a Consultant. Everything went well and I felt a good vibe from all the interviewers. At the end before closing our session I asked when can I expect to hear back from the team, in which they told me it was a fair question since they are still conducting interviews for the next 2 weeks and told me to expect to hear back in 3 weeks. 3 weeks passed by and no word. So I followed up with the first hiring manager who I spoke with on the phone. A week later, no response. I politely followed by that following week, only to have no reply yet again. I reached out to the executive assistant as she was the only other person I had emailed in the past, but she had an out of office reply and mentioned her backup. I followed up with her backup and let him know that I was trying to reach so and so. Still again, no reply. \r\n\r\nI thought KP would be a professional place where you don\u2019t just leave anyone hanging. We are human beings too and it would be nice to know if there is a path forward with KP or should we move on to something else.

After working with the 3rd-party we identified that their target salary was well below my target, but the 3rd-party identified he was able to get them to increase their range and arranged a phone interview. The phone Interview with the direct supervisor went well - focused on past experience, complexities of environment at Kaiser and how my past experience is applicable, familiarity with Kaiser, and why looking for this position. The interviewer also wanted to get to know me as a person and my style as well, which was awesome! Within a few days the 3rd-party identified that they wanted me to come in for an in-person interview, which would be arranged directly through Kaiser. The interview consisted of 2 separate panel interviews - one with staff-level & manager-level peers and the other with management/leadership - over the phone. The interview with the peers went ok, however they were not very engaging and the overall vibe I got was not friendly (more like why are you here?), excluding one team member. The questions asked by peers were focused on previous experience in working with teams, working offsite/remote, and past project experiences. The second interview (with management/leadership) went well. In general, management shared their vision for the team and how they want the candidate to fit in. The questions asked focused on experience managing staff, performing projects, challenged and how they were overcome, adding value, leadership, and communication. Within a day or two was contacted by HR and provided an offer that was significantly lower than what I was making and what was discussed. I did not decline the offer, only acknowledged that an offer was made. I spoke with the 3rd-party and he was also upset and said he would find out. Ultimately, it appears that they decided they had some limits based on making sure people are being paid same amounts for same positions and also they wanted to fill the lower position. I declined the offer and the counter offers made. I feel like it was deceptive and waste of my time as I was very clear about salary expectations upfront and had received multiple offers well within and exceeding my salary expectations. I don\u2019t believe this is a good practice to advertise for one position to draw people in and switch to another position without clearly discussing with the candidate.
