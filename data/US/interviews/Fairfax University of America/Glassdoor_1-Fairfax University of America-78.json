First, phone interview with the HR everything goes fine, she said she will call me within next 2 weeks. Two weeks later the IT department called and said he will call me the next week with some test for the job. \r\nNext week comes by, HR or IT department did not call me but emailed me saying \"There will be Skype interview with the IT department\" and for some reason, the soonest that I could do would be the next 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nIt's roughly 4 weeks now. And because I am a good person and always understand people's condition I tried to give this a chance.\r\n\r\nNow comes to the Skype interview. I met 2 of the IT department persons. They assigned me a test to design one of their web pages and they also mentioned about the job responsibility which I am applying for. \r\nHe said he will need me to design a website (with Adobe or any design tools) and give it to the other department to get it develop or code. However, the test that they gave me, requires me to design as well as develop within a short amount of time. \r\n\r\nAgain because I am a nice person and just want to get this over with (even though that's not what I am applying for and that is not listed in the job responsibility) I give it a go.\r\n\r\nAfter I send the test. One week goes by, no phone call, or email from any of the department. I tried to give them heads up. Turns out, they forgot to notify me that I passed the test.\r\n\r\n2 weeks later they want me to come to their campus in Virginia to talk to another IT department for the final interview. I thought this is gonna be more of the design talk since that's the position that I was applied for. Plus, I remember from the last interview with one of the IT department, told me that all I do would be design the website, possibly making a mockup and do some test on the website. \r\n\r\nOh god no, they asked me about immigration questions and the technical questions that have nothing to do with web design. Every different aspect of code and development of the website, even SEO question (search engine optimization) which I never even mention it in my resume. In the end, I look like a donkey who had no idea even what they are asking.
