The campus also is compact, relatively nice and accessible.\r\n\r\nConversely, the interview schedule was disjointed (I am used to having all committee members in one room, as opposed to meeting with them separately) and lunch consisted of a formal interview in a public dining room instead of a relaxed conversation that would have allowed me to eat the food in front of me.  Moreover, my presentation entailed providing short responses to questions that I had been asked during previous sessions.  \r\n\r\nFinally, I had the misfortune of interacting with the person to whom I would have reported via a video call.  She had just been hired but was slated to start later in the year and had reportedly posted a link to the job for which I was interviewing on her LinkedIn page the day before my campus visit.  Despite the senior role that she would occupy at Goucher College, this person was quite condescending and obnoxious (microaggression personified?); she denigrated my references, wanted to know why a former supervisor had not been listed (I deliberately chose individuals with whom I had worked at liberal arts colleges, as the only supervisor relevant to the role had retired) and blithely dismissed my candidacy because I did not belong to a professional association of which she apparently is an active member.  Her tone was insulting and accusatory, and when she was done, the boss-in-waiting abruptly ended the call.\r\n\r\nMy time at Goucher was bewildering to say the least, and the lack of clarity regarding simple questions that I posed, the bizarre interview schedule, my interesting interaction with the boss-in-waiting, lack of intentional staff diversity and issues regarding the institution\u2019s fiscal health were warning signs that I could not ignore.", "Interview Questions": "Why are you interested in working at Goucher?"}, {"date": "7 Jan 2020", "title": "Operations Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Goucher College", "Interview Descriptions": "There was a phone conversation with an assistant director that lasted about 30 minutes.
