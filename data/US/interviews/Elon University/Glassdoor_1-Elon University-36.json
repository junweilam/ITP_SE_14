From the date that the position stopped accepting applications to the date they gave me my final disposition took 3 months. It took a month to receive an invitation for an initial Skype interview. The interview was with their \"hiring committee\" and consisted of the standard interview questions. After the Skype interview was completed I was asked to come for a face-to-face interview the following week. This interview took 4 hours and included talking with faculty, staff and students. I was also asked to prepare and give a 30 minute presentation on some type of educational technology (very little instructions were provided for this part). \r\n\r\nEveryone seemed very professional and experienced. The staff and faculty were friendly and seemed vested in the person who was going to be taking this position. I was given the opportunity, at the end of the interview, to ask questions about the job and details. The benefits seemed competitive with other similar institutions but answers to question of pay were confusing. When asked about the pay compensation, the reply was \"Well, we pay lower than most other higher education institutions. You are hourly, so it will be low 20s.\" It was not specified if this was low $20k/year or low $20/hour... I tend to think low $20k/year, somewhere in the range of $12/hour.\r\n\r\nAfter the face-to-face interview my references were all contacted within 3 weeks. After my last reference was contacted, I emailed the position contact (that I had been in contact with since the first interview) and reiterated my interest in the job and inquired whether they had an updated time table for the rest of the interview process. I received no reply after two weeks. So I emailed the contact again, thanking them for being a possible candidate for their position and letting them know that anything additional they need from me I would provide. Another week and a half went by without a reply from the interview contact. I finally got an HR automated email saying that I was no longer being considered for the position. \r\n\r\nOverall the process seemed entirely too drawn out for the position and requirements. The staff and faculty were very professional when I met them face-to-face but I would have liked to get a reply to the multiple emails that I sent to the job contact (almost a month with no replies). I feel that the lack of reply displayed a fair amount of unprofessionalism for a person tasked with hiring and welcoming applicants and new hires into a position.", "Interview Questions": "How would you interact with faculty members in order for them to understand that integrating technology into their lessons could be beneficial?"}, {"date": "9 Mar 2013", "title": "Technology Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "N/A", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Elon University", "Interview Descriptions": "Needlessly long and complicated given the fact that Elon hires based on degree and the ability to manipulate.", "Interview Questions": "What color is your brain?"}, {"date": "21 Jul 2015", "title": "Office Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0I interviewed at Elon University in Aug 2012", "Interview Descriptions": "Very laid back; asked more questions about personal life than work skills.

About 1 month after applying, I received a phone call for a quick 15 minute phone interview with one of the assistant deans at the school who was on the hiring committee. A short few days later, an invitation to come down to the school for a day-long interview was received via email. Upon acceptance, arrangements were made within a few days for an interview date. The interview was a full day from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. It started off with coffee with one of the hiring committee members -- this was just an informal chat about how I got to be interested in career counseling and what the position entailed and what to expect for the rest of the day. This was followed by about 3 more 1-on-1 interviews with the dean, the supervisor I would be working directly under, and the supervisor's direct supervisor. The interviews all went extremely well except for the supervisor I would have been working for -- considering that he was the director of career services, he did a very poor job of interviewing me and I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt as he himself had only joined the school 3 weeks prior. However, I also took his behavior as red flag. He hadn't read my resume, and had to ask me 2-3 times what my name was in the interview. He asked me where I was working...which obviously is also on my resume. Then his cell phone rang and he answered it and proceeded to have a 30-45 second conversation with his wife. Extremely poor etiquette for an apparent \"professional\" who does career development for a living! Then he kept bragging about what a great director he is and said all these catch phrases like \"i don't abdicate, I advocate!\" After my interview with him, I interviewed with his supervisor, who was very nice but she ended up saying, verbatim, all the same catch phrases that described her supervising style...exact same wording! I don't know who's words were who's, but my gut feeling is telling me that the director of career services copied them from her. So I left that interview feeling like my prospective direct supervisor was a fraud. These interviews were followed by a group lunch interview with other career services staff and a few professors...this was more easy-going and relaxed, but still there were a lot of questions on what my ideas were for the career services office, how outreach to students could be done better, marketing ideas, etc. After lunch was a campus tour led by one of their students. Then there was a short break to relax, freshen up for a bit. Then a final interview with the chair of the hiring committee. Everything went extremely well and was very easy, it was just unfortunate the the director of career services was such a poor representative for the school and was seemingly problematic in his behavior. But otherwise, the folks at Elon are gracious and pleasant, very easy-going. I would have felt extremely comfortable working their. There was such great hospitality displayed. The director of career services is not from North Carolina...he's from Ohio or somewhere...so he obviously didn't have the hospitable nature like the other southerners that worked there. Elon's campus is also gorgeous and an ideal work environment. It's just too bad that the director of career services doesn't fit the culture and work ethic of Elon. But for anyone looking for better quality of life, keep an eye on this employer...and maybe look for something outside career services, until this director leaves.", "Interview Questions": "The position was focused on the career counseling for students in the college of arts and sciences...a pretty broad field. How would you cater your career counseling and programming efforts to students in the drama or other arts departments? (From the drama professor)"}]]
