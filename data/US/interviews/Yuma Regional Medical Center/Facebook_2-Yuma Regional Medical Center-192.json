After a brief phone interview with her, the next step was a Go-To meeting with the CHRO.  He was awesome and I was so excited!.  Followed by on site interviews with a few more than 10 people.  Very interesting interview questions and some pretty good rapport.  It seemed an offer was forthcoming.  Some concerns were the amount of time spent there -  the group seemed to be rightfully concerned with whether or not someone would really relocate, but the arrangements did not allow much free time to explore alone as, after a morning full of interviews, a lunch with potential colleagues and then a tour with a realtor, I was wiped out. I was also ill the whole time and pressing through to make a great impression, and with the time difference, it wasn't easy to muster the strength to explore the night before or the night after.  Also, was concerned that two HR positions within the reporting structure were vacant, although this should not have posed a problem to us as professionals.  About a week later, I was emailed by the CHRO that an offer was made to a Recruiting Manager and she would reach out for an additional interview.  She was very inflexible, called when I was at work, provided a very (one day) small interview window, began texting but then left days without responding when I texted her back.  Since I wanted to make sure the team knew I was still interested, I replied to the CHRO via email that we were working on getting something scheduled.  Within a short window of time, this new manager, who hasn't even started yet, texted me that they decided to move on with other candidates and thanked me for \"reaching out\".  As if all the hours invested were a mere reaching out.  Also, they checked my references before the offer phase  and before the interview phase was completed.
