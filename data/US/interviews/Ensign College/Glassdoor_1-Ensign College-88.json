I had a great phone interview and was certain that I'd get another. I did, and it was very unimpressive.\r\nWhen I arrived for the interview, there was a very disheveled looking woman on her cell phone waiting for me. I was early, so I don't understand what the panic was about. She offered me a bottle of water and took me upstairs.\r\nWhen we got upstairs, she handed me a packet and asked me to fill it out. It asked me to hand-write SQL, which I did. The queries were easy, and I wrote with Oracle syntax, which I specified.\r\nThe next sheet was a dashboard with proprietary data on it. I was given about two minutes to look it over and identify any errors in the data. It was a very large dashboard with unfamiliar data, so naturally I was at a loss, but tried anyway.\r\nThe manager came out and hurriedly asked if I was finished. What was the rush? I had arrived early, so why was everyone rushing so much?\r\nThe interview itself was mostly okay with bland, generic questions.\r\nAfter the interview, I sent a follow-up email to the manager thanking her and expressing my continued interest in the position. I never heard back.
