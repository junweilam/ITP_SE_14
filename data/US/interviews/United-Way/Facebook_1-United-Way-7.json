It was incredibly simple, but it took longer than it should have.\r\n\r\nTo begin, the job posting was posted on CareerBuilder with a contact email at the bottom, so sending my resume/coverletter took seconds as I already had it ready to go on my desktop.  I was called for an interview about two weeks later at a specific date and time because their interviewing schedule was very tight. I would have missed the opportunity to interview if I didn't come in at the time they chose.\r\n\r\n As I arrived, I IMMEDIATELY felt comfortable. The receptionist was cordial and professional, the building was pleasant to the eye and the HR lady came down to meet with me very quick -- just like I like it.\r\n\r\nAs I spoke with her, she effortlessly described the great things about United Way; how the organization helps the community, the benefits of working there, the laid back culture...\r\n\r\nAnd it gets even better : My interviewers were very relaxed and friendly. After discussing my resume and the position, we had a great conversation about whatever came to our minds : Nevada, Life, Travel, future plans, goals, etc.\r\n\r\n\"This was the place I'm looking for!\" I thought. I instantly felt apart of the family. \r\n\r\nAfter extending the interview an hour past the scheduled end point, I walked out knowing that the position was mine.\r\n\r\nA call for salary requirements came three weeks later. Second interview came another two weeks later, which consisted of more people to meet. Questions remained simple -- I enjoyed that they seemed more interested in my personality than my experience (although I have 4+years in Finance)\r\n\r\nReference check came another week later and each call lasted about 20 mins. All four of my references joked that it felt like they should have the position instead of me, because unfortunately for them, the reference check was an interview in itself. :)\r\n\r\nThen, another person checked three of my references.\r\n\r\nThen another.  They were doing everything in their power to make sure everything was valid about me. They take hiring very seriously.\r\n\r\nIt all worked out in the end though. The job offer came the next day, and MY GOD, the pay was beautiful.\r\n\r\nDrug test followed a week later.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about yourself.

That interview was in a \"panel\" format, with 5 or 6 participants from various departments, and was much more in-depth. The participants asked intelligent and insightful questions about my experience and qualifications, as well as how I would approach various challenges and situations (most of which were clearly based on the realities of the position). The panel members were very friendly and  personable and helpful, and made sure I had plenty of time to ask questions, etc. It was a very pleasant interview experience; after the meeting the HR rep had me fill out some forms and provide my reference info, and said they'd let me know. However, nobody ever contacted me. I called the HR rep and left two messages inquiring if the position had been filled, but never got a response. I didn't mind not being offered the job - it was a very tight job market and a very desirable position - but I would have appreciated a phone call letting me know either way.
