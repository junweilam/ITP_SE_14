This interview was definitely very long and thorough. I believe all the right questions were asked in regards to them finding their ideal candidate. I know every question they asked I answered with intention and authenticity. I made it to their final final rounds, where I met with 5 individuals and they were all very very kind and great!! \r\n\r\nAs part of my values is transparency, I brought up a personal matter and shared what my start date might be due to this matter. I understood and knew that might throw them through the loop as the agency itself is going through transition YET they were kind and told me I\u2019d hear back. \r\n\r\nI heard back and it was that I didn\u2019t get the job. Felt a bit of frustration yet grateful for the opportunity and again understand it was just not the right timing. \r\n\r\nGreat org working on improving their culture and honestly great individuals.", "Interview Questions": "Lots of racial equality questions. \r\n\r\n"}, {"date": "9 Mar 2021", "title": "Analyst Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at One Degree", "Interview Descriptions": "The interviewing team was very thorough, and asked thoughtful questions.

If anything, she seemed worried I was overqualified. It would have been a slight pay decrease but I was excited to contribute to something more meaningful that your average software startup.\r\n\r\nDidn't hear much from them, then out of nowhere, they wanted me to come in for an interview. That time didn't work. It sounded like we were going to chat the following week.

There was a coding challenge at the end where I had to write the HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a page where a button that had a certain look and certain behaviors (it had to replicate itself).
