Was called in next week for a panel interview, which consisted of 5 department heads.   Our group of new grads consisted of 5 people.  First, our group went inside the conference room where each department head asked us a question and then everybody in the group had to answer it.  It felt a bit awkward to hear same question answered 5 times.  After those questions were done, we were presented with a scenario where we had to work as a group to prioritize 5 patients and then discuss possible treatments for those patients.  We were given only 3 minutes to figure out those scenarios so I guess the point of this exercise was to test our teamwork to see how everybody was working together under pressure.  Afterwards, we were  given a 2-page medication worksheet to complete.  No calculator was allowed so brush up on your long division skills beforehand.  The whole interview took us about 2 hours.
