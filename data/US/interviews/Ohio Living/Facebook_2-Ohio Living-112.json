So the entire process took about 2 weeks. \r\n\r\nI went to the hiring event they were having at the facility.  I filled out the mini application they had all applicants fill out,  I made sure I put that I was available for weekends only first or second shift. So I got a tour of the facility and the person who gave me the tour inform me of the hours of first and second shift and also went over the resident assistant role.  I got the chance to meet a few people in that role.  Everyone was very nice.\r\n\r\nA week after the interview I received a phone call stating that I applied for the resident assistant weekends nights.  I informed the individual  that I did apply for the resident assistant position, however the position I applied for was the day shift online.  But I put on the application that I filled out, I stated I am flexible to work day or evening  shift weekends.  The individual  stated that I can inform I guess the hiring manager (I forgot the name) that you are flexible to work day or evening.  I informed the individual I could not work nights because I have a full time job during the week day and working nights that will run into my full time.  The individual stated they didn't understand why there was notes on my application for night shift.  The individual stated that they will call me back. They never did.\r\n\r\nI went to look at my application status and I notice that I was withdrawn from the position and then put back into the position.  I was very confused, I never withdrawn from the position.  The position I applied for said clearly \"Weekends-Days\", so I would not have withdrawn from that position.  Couple days later I was declined for that position.  \r\n\r\nEveryone at the facility was very nice and I don't have anything bad to say about that.  However,  I am still confused on how the position I applied for was for days only  and my application I stated I can work days or evening and I was offered Weekends-Nights. Then withdrawn from the position I initially applied for and place back into the position just to be declined.", "Interview Questions": "None was asked.
