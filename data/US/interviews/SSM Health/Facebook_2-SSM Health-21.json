Oh, so excited!!!...and nervous. I passed my phone interview and with the final question of, \"Do you have any additional questions?\" I had to respond, \"When can I start??\" The response of, \"I'd like to offer you an in person interview, \" nearly made me cry!

I spoke with another applicant in the lobby who was praying much as i, that we'd be accepted.  I was greeted by a lovely staff member and taken in for my initial interview with two very friendly ladies. Their general demeanor put me at ease and once my butterflies landed, respond to their questions of qualifications and previous work history with confidence in my abilities and my self. Thinking I'd completed the process, I was surprised by being immediately interviewed by an additional two staff members. My butterflies started once again.... but everyone was so wonderful that I met (right down to the janitorial staff) that I knew I wanted to be a part of their team. Two days later I received word that I'd been accepted and once compensations was done reviewing my background they'd be making me an employment offer.

One about 2 months ago for a Phlebotomist position and the other for Endoscopy Tech just a few weeks ago. The interview for the phlebotomist one didn't go so well. There were 2 people. Neither one of them looked or sounded like they wanted to be there. I never did hear anything back from them about the position. Even though they told me that they would get back to me either way. \r\nThe interview for the Tech position was just a few weeks ago, but with how the interview went, I can honestly say I will never apply for another position with this company no matter how desperate I am. The interview was so bad that I literally emailed HR and let them know just how horrible it was and to also withdraw all my other applications from other positions I applied for. I would never want to work for a company that treats their prospective employees with such little respect and professionalism.\r\nTo make a long story short, I am a MA. From a previous employer I had gained extensive training far beyond what I had learned in college. Alot of my duties were RN work. I am very proud and honored to have those skills under my belt and if I felt I was incompetent I would never perform those duties. When asked about my previous employer and the extensive skills, one RN interviewer (there were 3) asked if I performed these skills alone. I said yes, but I always had the doctors there in case. I did recovery in PACU almost every day and IV's and had also learned to push meds thru IV's. I taught injection training, was the lab coordinator, the lead phlebotomist, the only MA at this small clinic and also a surgical tech as well. It was part of my job and I was proud to have honed those skills. I didn't just learn them overnight. Anyways, the 3 RN's who interviewed me for this position had rolled their eyes more than 3 separate times during the interview and also ridiculed me and doubted my skills. They laughed several times and mumbled under their breath about the \" lack of care\" at this small fertility clinic I had previously worked for. They were all literally appalled that I, a Medical Assistant, was capable of performing those skills. They made sure to  stress the fact that a MA in their clinic would never be given the chance to perform those skills no matter my level of education and certification. The amount of nonprofessional demeanor and lack of praise was sickening. From other interviews Ive had in the past few months with other clinics, the interviewers were actually delighted and happy for me that I had the proper training and opportunity to hone those skills. Never in all my entire MA existence have I ever had an interview where I was treated like a low life at the bottom of a totem pole. I have never been laughed at or doubted like that before. It took every ounce of strength I had to finish the interview and thank them for their time. The moment I hit my car, I broke down in tears. \r\nFor anyone considering a career with this healthcare system, I would think twice. Also i found out that there really isn't much room for advancement or incentives. The benefits are horrible and the starting pay is far less than what most people expect, especially having 5 or more years of  expertise. And if an interview can go that bad, just imagine what it would be like working there??!! No thank you. \r\nThe interview dragged on for over an hour with alot of the questions being asked several times, just in different wording. The questions were not easy and at the end of the interview  when one of them asked if I had any questions, before I could even get out 2 words, they all stood up and said ok, we will get back to shortly. They didn't even give me a chance to ask any questions. \r\nSome other words of advice, we are all one. Doctors, nurses, MA's, CNA's, lab personnel all need to work together as a team for their patients. The hospitals and clinic's you want to work for are the ones that don't take your title for granted or discriminate you for your title. Like I said, we are here to serve our patients and give them the best care possible. Titles are simply titles. They don't make you any better than the other.
