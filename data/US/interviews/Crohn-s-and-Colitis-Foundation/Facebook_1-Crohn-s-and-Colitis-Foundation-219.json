I happily accepted. \n\nI left that meeting with a verbal offer of employment including the salary I negotiated, with an on-going discussion about how I would be compensated for hitting the fundraising quotas we established as parameters for employment. Dollar amounts, dates, the whole first year was in play. I had committed to raise more money than anyone else ever had at that chapter. And I could have. \n\nThe executive director, my new boss, said to look for my offer letter in email. I started on Wednesday. \n\nSaturday and Sunday - nothing. Monday no email, plus no returned phone calls from E.D. Now I\u2019m calling \u201ccorporate office\u201d to find out if he\u2019s out sick. Could someone get back to me please? I start in two days! That night I get an email from HR stating they decided not to fill the position. \n\nTuesday still not a word from the man who hired me. I call corporate and argue with the worst human I\u2019ve ever spoken to, who claimed to be \u201chead of human resources\u201d but whose voice did not convince me. Getting no satisfactory answers OR A SINGLE APOLOGY from anyone at CCF, I gave up. \n\nI\u2019d already lost out on other lucrative job offers. Do I think they took my ideas and hired someone with half the experience at half the cost? Infuriated I wrote the whole ordeal out, including important details based on the meticulous notes I take in real time. I sent this saga to the handsomely paid CEO Michael Osso directly. \n\nA mentor and professional reference of mine, who knew Michael, agreed Osso had the right to know what happened. How I was treated by CCF was traumatizing and cost me greatly - and they should NEVER do that to anyone ever again.\n\nUnfortunately Osso didn\u2019t respond to my email. He received and read it, but did not reply. Our mutual friend, who was copied on the long and sordid email, did however. No one should ever be deceived like this. Knowing the CEO condones this behavior, I\u2019ll never again trust or support CCF.", "Interview Questions": "How would you increase funding opportunities in Omaha?"}, {"date": "18 Sept 2022", "title": "Marketing Coordinator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Crohn's & Colitis Foundation in Jan 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview process occurred over the course of about 3 weeks with 5 different virtual interviews.

Another interview was scheduled and as I was paying the parking meter I got a call to cancel. Again, an interview was scheduled. The offie was tiny and cluttered. The interview itself seemed disorganized. Possibly because in such a small space the only place available for an interview was the ED's office. But there wasn't enough room for everyone so I met with 3 people 2 at a time. I got the impression that there had been a lot of turn over in the position and that they possibly had some unrealistic goals.
