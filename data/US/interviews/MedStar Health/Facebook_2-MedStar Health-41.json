Initial interview was with hiring manager (Strategic Planning Manger) and was relatively informal and friendly, approx. 90 mins, including a lot of 2 way information sharing (i.e. she was keen to tell me all about the company and working arrangements too). She decided in front of me to make me the last of 3 candidates to come back for second round interviews.\r\n\r\nSecond round interviews took place about 10 days later. Consisted of 3 separate interviews of 45-60mins each:\r\n1) Market Research Manager\r\n2) Business Developemnt Manager\r\n3) Two analysts, who would be my co-workers\r\n\r\nEveryone was very friendly and professional. All 3 senior managers genuinely seemed to enjoy working there and had been there for aout 5 years each. Interviews consisted of many typical questions (\"what can you bring to the company?\", \"what are your strengths\" etc) but also fairly honest accounts of work ethic and environment. Employee comments included:\r\n-Good work-life balance. 8:30-5 is typical. Not usually expected to work overtime. Good paid leave allowance.\r\n-Almost everyone has own office. Good for getting work done but quite isolated.\r\n-Very hierarchical structure. Analyst reports to one manager who may then take work up the chain. Analyst may never see work again, or receive acknowledgement or credit, or be involved in more senior meetings.\r\n-Most work is done independently rather than team oriented. Most co-worker relationships developed informally i.e. work lunches etc rather than during office hours.\r\n\r\nCorridors were immaculate and offices were large. Whole place was VERY quiet. Seemed a good environment if you like sitting still and getting on with your own work, but not overly social or collaborative.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Medstar is a large corporation and that departments are organised and run very differently. \r\n\r\nBest advice if going into similar format is to take notes with you and/or a list of questions to ask each interviewer. I was tired by the end of the third interview and had clearly run out of questions and extra things to say which probably made me look a little disorganised. At the end of the 3 second round interviews I was then met in the corridor by the original hiring manager who asked me what I thought, what stood out, and if I had any more questions. I was not expecting this and could have been better prepared for that, too! :-(", "Interview Questions": "What do you think you can bring to Medstar?"}, {"date": "25 Jun 2014", "title": "Hospice Secretary Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at MedStar Health (Leonardtown, MD) in Mar 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Appointment made via phone by Human Resources Assistant.
