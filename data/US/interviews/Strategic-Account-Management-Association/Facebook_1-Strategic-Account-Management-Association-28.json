First, it took the person in charge of HR - which is just the company's accountant - over 4 weeks to simply set up a phone interview. Once invited to attend an in-person one, I found out the night before they were actually going to be interviewing me for two positions (I only got a heads up because I knew someone working there). I had to meet with six people over the course of three hours. When I asked one of the staff what they liked best about the company, he said \"nothing\" - naturally I left feeling awkward. Days later they realized I hadn't met with the supervisor for the other role they interviewed me for, so insisted I set up another phone interview. At this point the process had taken almost 2 months when they finally offered me a job (conveniently the one I hadn't even applied for - bait and switch). The worst part: after reviewing the offer and inquiring about some options, they left me cold turkey. Eventually I received an email from the accountant stating they were reconsidering me as a candidate! Another week went by until they finally emailed again saying they were retracting the job offer and ultimately not hiring anyone\u2026not only was this unprofessional, but a complete waste of everyone\u2019s time. If this company\u2019s complete lack of organization and respect for people interested in them is any sign of how they\u2019re doing, don\u2019t bother.", "Interview Questions": "Their questions varied by department and difficulty - overall it wasn't transparent who was interviewing me for which role"}, {"date": "7 Jan 2016", "title": "Membership Manager Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied in-person.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Strategic Account Management Association in Feb 2012", "Interview Descriptions": "first with office manager then CEO, then rest of staff just to check fit. easy process. 2 inperson and 2 on phone.
