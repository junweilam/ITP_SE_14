Then, they brought me in for an on-site interview.  The interview was a panel of three hiring managers.  It began with a description of the position and panel introductions.  Then, there was a 15 minute \u201cassessment\u201d in which you provided written answers to scenario questions related to data analysis skills.  Once the 15 minutes passed, the panel members came back into the room and asked that you discuss your responses.  The last part of the interview consisted of the panel members asking a series of standard interview questions.  The total on-site interview lasted one hour.  I was disappointed in the interview process and how I was treated.  I have a degree that they were looking for according to the job description since it was listed as a desired qualification.  However, the panel members didn't know what my degree was, and when I explained it, they were under the impression I was going through a major career change since they still didn't think my degree matched the position.  I didn't get an offer, but they did suggest I apply for another position, a Case Manager position, as they thought I would be a good fit.  I have no background matching a case manager, nor do I personally believe I am qualified for that role.
