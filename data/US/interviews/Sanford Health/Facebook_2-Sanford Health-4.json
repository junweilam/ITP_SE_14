I was offered interviews for all three. \r\n\r\nFor the first role, I spoke directly with one of the Hiring Managers within HR. The interview ended with a promise that I would be getting a call and/or email from him sometime in the next week regarding next steps. I followed up with a \u201cThank You\u201d email expressing continued interest in the position. I never got a reply, and received a auto-generated email notification a few weeks later that the role was being paused or cancelled. \r\n\r\nFor the second role, I received a request to self-schedule a Phone Screen. I spoke with a low-energy/enthusiasm Recruiting representative a few days later, which ended with a candid disclosure (which I appreciated) that my earnings history would likely rule me out for the position. From conversations with other employees at Sanford, and based on my pre-call research, I knew compensation would be a challenge to overcome. Their target salary for the role was about 45% my previous. My only lingering question\u2014 why wasn\u2019t salary wasn\u2019t discussed in the first 60 seconds, to save 30 minutes of my (and the employee\u2019s) time and energy? \r\n\r\nFor the third role, I received a request to auto-schedule a Phone Screen, and was asked to complete a web-based (video) short answer component. I spoke with another Recruiting representative two days after the video portion. The format was structured, timed, and did not allow for rapport-building. Though it went well, there seemed to be some dead air on the other end of the phone when we discussed my earnings history. I was told I would be updated about next steps shortly. Regardless, I still sent a \u201cThank You\u201d email expressing continued interest in the position.  I received an auto-generated email notification a few days later that I was no longer under consideration.    \r\n\r\nAccording to another review I read from a HR candidate, it sounds like my experience was par for the course at Sanford.  Their vetting process is extremely mechanical and cold, and meant to keep candidates at a distance.  Typical Shared Services high-volume \u201cassembly line Recruiting\u201d based in metrics/data (and likely, micromanagement). And although they use an ATS, it appears they do not communicate/coordinate well. I answered the same half dozen questions repeatedly.  Apparently, at Sanford, they believe they are living in a buyer\u2019s market, and prospects are little more than a candidate number, a body. It seems to be a common theme from the employee reviews I read, which hint at high levels of attrition. Which is strange considering the CEO is the former Chief People Officer. You\u2019d think that HR professionals would treat fellow HR professionals with more warmth. At the very least, you\u2019d expect them to understand that the impressions candidates are left with (the \u201ccandidate experience\u201d) are likely to be shared directly with other potential candidates, and on platforms such as Glassdoor.
