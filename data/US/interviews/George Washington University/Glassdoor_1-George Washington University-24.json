Was scheduled for an interview at one of GWUs academic offices - Administrative Manager position - but when I arrived in DC I got lost (of course) and called the office over 30 times but no one answered the phone.  It was not during normal lunch hours and I placed those 30+ calls well before my interview was scheduled.  After driving around DC for FOUR hours (yes, 4), I pulled over and tracked down a direct phone number to the person who was supposed to interview me.  She apologized and communicated that the person I was coordinating w/ was unexpectedly pulled into a meeting w/ her.  My thoughts:  There's only one person around to cover phones?  I've worked in a large University for over 6 years and I know better.  The interviewee (which happened to be one of the heads of the department) was not willing to go forward w/ the interview and instead suggested a phone interview.  So, I rescheduled for a phone interview and her assistant called me and informed me, minutes before the interview was supposed to take place, that she was pulled into yet another meeting.  So, I rescheduled again!  The time came for the interview and I received no phone call from anyone!  The lack of organization and professionalism portrayed by those employees put a bad taste in my mouth and I decided not to bother with following up.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}], [{"date": "4 May 2012", "title": "Executive Associate Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1+ week.\u00a0I interviewed at George Washington University (Washington, DC) in Jul 2010", "Interview Descriptions": "I had applied online, and was first brought in for a 90-minute interview with my direct supervisor and two peers.
