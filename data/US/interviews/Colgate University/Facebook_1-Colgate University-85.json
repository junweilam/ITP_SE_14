The application did not allow me to self identify as disabled but did allow me to say where I found the job posting; which indicates whoever reviewed my application was aware of my disability. Nowhere in the hiring process did they ask about if I needed any accommodations, in fairness their website does indicate that you may ask for accommodations however this is not applicable as I did not apply through their website directly.\r\n\r\nI was contacted by someone in human resources about a week after applying to ask for a word document describing my work experience. Despite already turning in a resume with my work experience listed under two bold headers of \"EMPLOYMENT\" and \"EXPERIENCE\" I followed through and sent a more expanded explanation in a word document.\r\n\r\nAnother week passes, I get a phone call from the same person in human resources asking me how much of a salary I would be willing to take. They explain that they want me to agree to a salary before going through the process any further because, \"they don't want to waste to much time.\" I ask about what the benefits are for this position before I agree on a salary, they tell me to look on their website and that if I want to be a candidate for this position I have to make a decision by tomorrow. As I explained already, I had never been on Colgate's employment website as I applied through an agency. So I was not able to find a link to the benefits for this position and had to send an e-mail asking for a direct link. I received a response the next day with a direct link but felt extremely rushed into making a decision. \r\n\r\nApproximately one week later I get a phone call from the manager for this position. They inform me that they would like to schedule a one-on-one phone interview next week; I schedule an interview. When I receive the call I am immediately intimidated by the fact that four people are on the phone line. Normally I would have asked for an accommodation to handle a situation like this due to my disability at the very least a warning that it was going to be more than one person would have helped me immensely, particularly since I clarified it was going to be a conversation with one person.\r\n\r\nI was already intimidated by the interview due to the mix up involving how many people would be on the line. However the answer to the first question they asked me made me even more intimidated. They asked me, \"Why are interested in working at Colgate University and academia in general?\" As I said already, I am disabled and looking for an employer willing to understand the difficulties of this situation. So my attempt at acknowledging this without directly saying that was, \"When I apply to an institution, I try to find somewhere that has values similar to my own. I was looking at Colgate's mission statement and particularly enjoyed your commitment to inclusiveness and diversity.\" The response to this was, \"You do realize that this is a job at the bookstore and not the university?\" This shocked me. In essence they revealed to me that the bookstore does not have the same values as the university.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of interview, it was difficult to hear the interviewers on the speaker phone at times. I'm not sure why they didn't have individual phones on a conference call or at the very least sit in close proximity to the phone they were speaking into. Most of the questions were aimed at business experience, which I did not have much of as my resume, education, and work experience already indicated. Strangely the job posting didn't even mention this was what they were looking for and had far more of an emphasis on the graphic art/design side.\r\n\r\nAfter the interview I did not hear back from them for another month. I received a generic response from a generic HR e-mail telling me I was no longer in consideration. At the very least I would have liked to have heard back from the same person I spoke with in HR for the duration of two months.", "Interview Questions": "Why are interested in working at Colgate University and academia in general?"}, {"date": "12 Jun 2017", "title": "Senior Textbook Buyer Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Colgate University (Hamilton, NY) in Jan 2015", "Interview Descriptions": "It was very general, not at all difficult or unexpected.
