The application never showed up, so I followed up via email with no response. It was during the holidays, so I waited and followed up a second time just after Christmas. Still no response. I finally followed up a third time after January 1st, again with no response. About a month after that I received a form email saying that they had chosen someone else.

The phone interview went well and I was brought in for a face-to-face interview. Again it went well. I was told that I was wanted on board and my paperwork would be sent to human resources. We discussed pay, I was given a brief tour, and introduced to my future coworkers. I was notified by my references within a week that they had begun contacting them.  I was contacted repeatedly for one \"missing\" thing or another that needed to be filled out to \"complete\" my application and send it to the hiring manager. This meant filling  out a form for the background check, submitting transcripts,  ect. I was thanked by HR for being patient throughout the onboarding process because they are not generally this disorganized.  A week or so after not hearing from anyone  (at about this point my then-present job's notice had already ended) I called. My prospective supervisor never returned my call. HR did not return my call. I eventually spoke to HR who told me the programs where making final decisions about candidates at the end of the week and I would know then.  If they decided to hire me, I would be asked to complete a drug test and undergo fingerprinting. This was confusing because I had been told I got the job AND that I was in the final stages of on boarding and I was \"set to go\". Well, lo and behold, I received an email HR on a Friday saying they chose another candidate who met the job requirements. Needless to say, I was beyond frustrated that I wasted all that time, resigned from my job, and even turned down another job for this opportunity. While I am hopeful that they are more professional once hired, this experience alone has made me very leery of this agency.
