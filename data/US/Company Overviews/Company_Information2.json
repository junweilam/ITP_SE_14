        "employer_description": "Started in 1972, when there were no organized services for victims of crime and trauma to be found, Victim Assistance Program (VAP) is one of the original victim assistance programs in the nation. For nearly 50 years, VAP has served as a steadfast leader, innovator, and provider of victim services for not only our community but communities throughout the country as well. Members of our crisis response team supported victims at the Oklahoma City Bombing, 9/11, and most recently, the Dayton Ohio shootings.At VAP, our mission is to empower our community to restore lives impacted by crisis, violence, and tragedy.  Our purpose is to provide free crisis intervention, advocacy, and education to victims of crime and trauma and the professionals who serve this population. We help over 5,000 women, men, and children each year overcome the aftermath of their victimization. Our mighty team of 36 employees are available 24-hours a day, 7-days week, 365-days a year, to provide crisis intervention at crime scenes, in hospital emergency rooms, at schools, and anywhere a victim is in need. After one\u2019s crisis subsides, victims often engage in short and longer term personal and court advocacy to address their family\u2019s everyday needs. We have been offering these two core services since our agency\u2019s inception. However, our agency has transformed over the last eight years to adapt to the growing needs of our community. In 2013, our $730,891 annual budget allowed 14 staff to provide crisis intervention and advocacy services out of our small 1,500 square foot office. At the time, victims were provided excellent support however, our offices were not equipped to provide trauma informed, confidential, accessible, and inclusive services. This coupled with limited staff who were overworked, underpaid, with limited benefits, caused our leadership team to respond.Addressing the needs of our staff was a priority. If our staff were provided with the personal and professional resources to fulfill their jobs, and their lives, victims too would greatly benefit.  Over the last five years, we secured funding to increase salaries by 30%, developed a robust benefit package, moved into a new 10,500 square foot office, expanded technology capabilities, doubled the size of our staff to reduce burnout and case load sizes, and have grown our budget to a whopping $1,769,969.These sustainable funds have not only benefited our employees, but as we suspected, our clients as well. VAP programming is currently built upon the underlying belief that all crime victims should have access to high quality, culturally appropriate, victim-centered services.  In addition to increasing access to services by offering text and chat services, we have also expanded our reach by collaborating with all three municipal courts who provide us office space within each courthouse. Being a victim advocate is not easy, it takes ongoing training and support from an agency who understands the impact secondary trauma can have on this profession.. not just for direct service but for administrative staff as well. Because of this, we created the Summit Victim Assistance Academy in 2014 to provide professional development to our staff and volunteers. Education, our third core service has since blossomed. Our staff is currently provided with monthly internal in class training on a variety of topics including but not limited to, inclusivity, working with interpreters, helping the helper, vicarious trauma, and much more. Once the community started to learn about our unique specialized academy, inquiries from outside of the organization began. We then open our doors to advocates and others in helping professions to participate in separate Summit Victim Assistance Academy online and in class courses.People from all over the country have traveled to our Dr. Rev. Bob Denton training facility located across the hall from our main office.  We maintain a fabulous team of expert trainers, most of whom are staff, all credentialed victim advocates, some who are internationally certified to teach Crisis Response Team interventions on behalf of the National Organization of Victim Assistance, and some who are also members of both our state and national crisis response teams.We would not be where we are today without our founder, Rev. Dr. Bob Denton\u2019s, vision. Because of him, we were able to maintain the integrity of the core services he created almost 50 years ago. We have grown so much in the last eight years because we have listened to our staff, we have listened to experts in the field, we have listened to our community and most importantly, we have and will always listen to the needs of victims.We are Victim Assistance Program, we are Vapsters.",

From the detailed coaching guides we provide in many languages to the sharp-eyed officials at our international games, the focus is on real sports, real competition, real achievements.In Special Olympics, the power and joy of sport, shifts focus to what our athletes CAN do, not what they can't.

        "employer_description": "Thanksgiving Point is a Utah institution with more than 25 years serving the community in education and entertainment. Our vision is to engage families and individuals of all ages and abilities. We accomplish this through a variety of offerings and places to explore and visit. Thanksgiving Point is home to five world-class venues: Farm Country, Butterfly Biosphere, Museum of Ancient Life, Ashton Gardens, and Museum of Natural Curiosity. Major annual events include Luminaria and the Tulip Festival, just to name a few. Each year more than two million visitors come to Thanksgiving Point from all 50 states and around the world. Team Members enjoy free venue admissions for themselves and their families, a 401K match incentive, Sundays always off, and so much more! Thanksgiving Point is a one-of-a-kind place, and we want Team Members who are that way too. 1.\tThe Thanksgiving Way\u2022\tAt Thanksgiving Point we believe that our Team Members are our best advertisement. We look for people who want to do something more than simply cash a paycheck. Rather, we encourage our employees to love what they do, and it shows on their face and body language. Our Team Members are our most prized asset, and we offer a safe working environment, a place to grow as a professional and a human being, and a workplace where learning is just as important as selling.2.\tA Place People Want to Visit\u2022\tWith more than two million visitors per year Thanksgiving Point is a true destination in the state of Utah. Nowhere else will you find a working farm, a natural history museum, a hands-on science museum, a 50-acre estate garden, and a glass house butterfly conservatory in one location. Each of these venues offers a truly unique experience that guests, and employees alike, love to visit and explore. If you love where you work is it really work? 3.\tGrowth Mindset\u2022\tAt Thanksgiving Point we encourage innovation. If you have new ideas that have never been explored, we love that. If you want to work with people who are curious like you, we need that. To have a growth mindset means you are willing to work hard and possess a curious, outside-the-box thinking. We are always looking for those who see the world through curious and explorative minds. If you start working in one area but want to learn a different role, you can do that here. Managers are willing and able to explore with all team members to help them find true joy in their work and find new skills and abilities in the process. 4.\tSomething for Everyone\u2022\tBecause of our diversity of offerings there is something for everyone at Thanksgiving Point. With jobs ranging from food services to invertebrate keeper, there really is something for you here. We need people who enjoy helping, teaching, and mentoring others. If you enjoy working behind the scenes on exhibits or on our security team, we have that too. Or, maybe you are more equipped to serve visitors with our guest services staff. 5.\tEmployee Perks\u2022\tAs a Thanksgiving Point Team Member your first perk is a free membership to Thanksgiving Point to use at your leisure when not working. This membership includes unlimited access to you and your immediate family to all five Thanksgiving Point venues. A membership also includes complimentary admissions to dozens of events throughout the year, including the always-popular Tulip Festival! You also get discounts on food services, special events, and gift shop purchases. Additionally, Thanksgiving Point Team Members have a great environment where learning and continuous education is encouraged and recommended, flexible working schedules including Sundays off always. We also are able to offer discounts at some of our partner locations like Brick Canvas and golf at the Thanksgiving Point Golf Club. Thanksgiving Point members and Team Members are also included in the American Horticultural Society's Reciprocal Admissions Program which provides free admission to nearly 300 gardens throughout North America and the Cayman Islands.",

Partnering with farmers across a range of different livestock and crops, we create unique solutions to local challenges.Today, Heifer International has operations in 21 countries around the world, working alongside local farmers, business owners and their communities, as they mobilize and envision their futures. Together, we build inclusive, resilient economies, so communities can develop effective ways to end global hunger and poverty in a sustainable way.To date, we have supported more than 42 million farming families across Africa, Asia and the Americas and in the past five years alone, we have worked alongside 2.7 million families to close the living income gap or set them on a path to doing so. Between now and 2030, we will support an additional 10 million people to reach a living income by scaling up our signature programs.

        "employer_description": "Written by Robert Pope, founding Board MemberWhen I first joined King of Peace Metropolitan Community Church in 1984, it was a small, growing community of faith. To get people involved and more active with King of Peace, a series of fundraisers were held every six months or so, in which church members would open their homes to host formal cocktail parties for $25 per person. The name \u201cMetropolitan Charities\u201d was simply made up. This way we were not promoting cocktail parties for a church fund (King of Peace). During the early days of the AIDS discovery, King of Peace was the first local faith-based organization that opened its heart and doors to those infected and affected by the disease. Volunteers helped set up and orchestrate counseling sessions, a food bank, and SDIA: Pinellas County\u2019s first AIDS support group. Much of the funding for these volunteer programs resulted from the Metropolitan Charities fundraising parties. My partner of these many years, Lawrence Konrad, was one of the original co-chairs of SDIA, and the first meeting to organize was held at our home, where I met my first AIDS patient/activist, a young man whom I ultimately represented (regarding legal matters).It was clear that more space was greatly needed in order for the organization to grow. Over the years it became apparent to the Board of Directors of King of Peace M.C.C. that Metro Charities needed to expand its base and bring in others from the community to serve on its board. This was not because of any disagreement with the church \u2013 only a recognition that the baby Metro Charities needed to sprout its wings and leave the mothership. This happened when Metro Charities left the church building and moved across the street, where it had much more room for client services, with the added benefit of better confidentiality and more space for a true community center: a desire of the LGBT community in Tampa Bay for many years. I am particularly proud of the continued success of Metro Wellness and Community Centers (formerly known as Metropolitan Charities) through the leadership of Lorraine Langlois, the current CEO. Who could have imagined that this small, undeveloped agency would grow into the positive agency serving several counties in Florida? Who could have imagined? It just shows you how important the selection of leadership is when it comes to a growing agency. Lorraine can be justly proud of the staff and administrators she has hired and nurtured through the years, and we as a community can be proud that these individuals serve so many throughout Tampa Bay. It is a tribute to Lorraine\u2019s leadership, and I am mighty proud to have been involved with the agency when Lorraine was hired as the first full-time employee. Today, Metro is a comprehensive social service agency that meets the needs of the HIV-affected, LGBT and other at\u2013risk communities of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco and Hernando Counties serving nearly 3,000 people at any one time through substance abuse treatment and prevention, counseling, case management, prevention services, a thrift store, and social and recreational programs.It is an honor to be part of an organization that offers and provides service that continues to enhance the quality of life. Always remember the beginnings.I greatly respect and honor the efforts of the founding members of Metro Wellness and Community Centers: Rev. Dr. Fred C. Williams and Rev. Renne Shawver. Of course, Lorraine Langlois would be included, as would Mark Davis. Johnny Williams, the CPA from Tallahassee (who died of complications from HIV), Charles Gerardi, PhD, who facilitated the first counseling sessions at King of Peace for those with HIV; John Barnett, DDS, who served for many faithful years as a member of the Board of Directors, and who was the first Dentist in Pinellas County that would accept and treat those with HIV; and the original Board of Directors of King of Peace who had the vision to see the opportunity and possibilities for Metropolitan Charities, and who served as its first Board of Directors \u2014 Rev. Dr. Fred C. Williams, Donna S. Remsnyder, Esq., Beverly Robinson, Gayle A Schultes, Lawrence A. Fischer, CPA, Richard F. Waugh, Pauline A. Cordeire, Richard L.

At any given time there are children busily exploring the BANANAS Playroom, parents stocking up on books and toys from our free boutique, and families meeting with counselors to find the perfect child care fit. We offer person-to-person, individualized support in a friendly and welcoming environment that is inclusive of all people.WHY WE\u2019RE UNIQUEWe offer services and support in nine different languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Amharic, and Thai.There are no sign-in sheets or appointments necessary. We welcome drop-in clients during all business hours, except on Fridays.Kids are encouraged to come in and play, color, and read while family members meet with counselors and payment coordinators.BANANAS was founded in the \u201970s by a group of moms who believed that everyone should have access to affordable child care, regardless of income. They formed a grassroots movement that eventually inspired resource and referral agencies in every county in California.WHERE OUR NAME CAME FROMWe get this question a lot and the answer has three parts. The founding mothers of our organization chose the name BANANAS, first, because their children were eating lots of bananas. Secondly, they sometimes felt that they were going \u201cbananas\u201d with the 24/7 challenges of parenthood. And thirdly, they wanted a name that was child-friendly, memorable, and in no way bureaucratic.As an interesting trivia fact, the original name was \u201cBANANAS: A Place to Find Playmates,\u201d but it was changed after we received numerous calls from adults requesting friends for themselves and not their children.

In 1969, people with developmental disabilities were mostly supported in Washington State's seven institutions with as many as 40 people per residence hall, with little recognition being given to them as human beings, having rights, abilities, and individual self-worth. The combined total population of the seven state institutions was over 8,000 people. Today most people with developmental disabilities reside in their own homes in their own communities. As has been our Board of Directors and Agency's belief, people with developmental disabilities have the right to live, learn, and work in the community just like everyone else.Over the years, Community Living has become known as a dynamic, ever-evolving, creative, exciting, and cutting-edge agency. We have been listed as one of the top supportive living programs for people with developmental disabilities in the nation by Syracuse University's Center for Human Policy. Community Living has been sought out for assistance and consultation by providers from Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, Mexico, and New Zealand, as well as providers from the states of Hawaii, New York, and Wisconsin.In order to maintain our very high and reputable standards our focus is always on how we deliver services, and decisions are based on what is in the best interest of the people to whom we provide services.Through the combined efforts of our staff, families and community, we are able to help develop skills and abilities to enhance individuals' Health and Safety, Power and Choice, Status and Contribution, Relationships, Inclusion Opportunities, and Competence.",

Compelled by the urgent needs he saw during his time as a human rights attorney, Gary Haugen and a small team of lawyers created International Justice Mission.1990 - RWANDAN GENOCIDEIt all started with the senseless tragedy of the Rwandan genocide. Working as a lawyer at the Department of Justice and as the United Nations\u2019 Investigator in Charge, Gary Haugen was struck by the lack of protection against violence that communities in poverty had around the world.1991 - DISCOVERING THE NEEDGary was on a mission to change that. Alongside a group of lawyers, human rights professionals and public officials, they launched an extensive study of the injustices witnessed by overseas missionaries and relief and development workers. The results showed the tremendous need for trained public justice professionals to confront the abuse and bring rescue to victims of violence.1997 - IJM ESTABLISHEDSeeing the magnitude of this need, Gary established IJM in 1997. IJM has now grown to more than 1,200 employees*\u201495% of whom are nationals of the countries where they work\u2014in 29 program offices in 17 countries who share in the mission of protecting people in poverty from violence.2005 - COMBATTING SEX TRAFFICKING IN CEBUWhen the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sent IJM a $5M grant to combat sex trafficking in Cebu, the Philippines, we had no idea what we were about to accomplish. After 4 years working alongside local law enforcement, we saw a shocking 72% decrease in the availability of children for commercial sexual exploitation.TODAY - MORE THAN 20 YEARS LATEROur global team has been on the frontlines fighting some of the worst forms of violence.
