Most of our support programs were cut but demands continued to grow. Rather than creating an understanding and empathetic environment for employees and volunteers during such a difficult time, pressure, micromanagement and lofty goals increased tenfold. Decrease in fundraising led to my boss suggesting I encourage volunteers to hold in-person fundraising events despite cdc recommendations and covid restrictions.

My revenue goals were doubled despite the ongoing pandemic and financial distress my communities were in.

It has not only affected me as an employee but has also discouraged my volunteers who are the backbone of the organization.\n\nBefore covid, my direct supervisor gave me little to no mentorship or real guidance, encouraged me to lie to volunteers on multiple occasions, cut corners to reach unrealistic metrics goals, and ignored employee concerns.

Money is the end-all-be-all for this non-profit, and I believe they will continue on this trajectory. The national chapter dictates much of the vision and is implemented on a chapter level. Harry Johns is leading the way into becoming more digitally-grounded (which may sound good at first, but it is at the expense of providing local, personable care). Several job descriptions are slowly changing to becoming more development-oriented (i.e. community partnerships = potential $$$$$).\r\n-With such small chapters, chances are you will have no room for growth or professional development.\r\n-At my particular branch, senior leadership micromanaged employees and squashed innovation and creativity. Manager-level staff continually would have to fight uphill battles. There is a significant division among staff. Most trust managers but do not trust local CEO/national.\r\n-Unnecessary drama between board/senior leadership/other staff. Some employees were very rude and unprofessional to colleagues.\r\n-Pay was significantly subpar considering other NGOs in the area (Even for people with masters degrees). The structure promotes a tight cash flow and prizes saving money over compensating employees.\r\n-Raises and bonuses are hard to come by. Unless you work in development/fundraising, then for some reason you get a bonus each year.\r\n-Quality of \"benefits\" was less than average.\r\n-Salaried employees are treated as hourly workers. Leadership prized office-time over results.\r\n-Staff retention is alarmingly low. In the time I was there, it was at around 50% per year. Instead of examining staff-satisfaction, senior leadership assumed it was a \"personnel problem\" instead of a sign of a decaying structure.\r\n-They have unrealistic hiring expectations and process. Not uncommon to be interviewed 5+ times with no definitive clarity until job offer. They also prefer several years experience for some of the most basic or entry level jobs. Forget everything you learned in salary negotiation- don't even try to negotiate on compensation- it' hopeless (there's supposedly \"no flexibility at this time\")."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great people, amazing cause!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people that I have the pleasure of working with are the reason I love what I do, and I am very passionate about the mission.

My former co-worker told me that upper management for the diversity department influenced and forced a supervisor to resign. Another person was targeted by the director of diversity  and given too much responsibilities.  in short, most of the resources that are distributed out  are not updated regularly or at all according to some dates that i have seen in my glimpses of handouts while i was there.    \r\n\r\n\r\nFAVORTISM:\r\n\r\nIn my time working at this office, i have seen certain people get promotions and other job incentives that did not deserve it.  Management likes to treat the favorites well with promotions and raises yearly. in the even that family members of the employee donates services or money, that person is provided with a certain about immunity from all disciplinary actions.   \r\n\r\nGENDER PREFERENCE\r\n\r\nThis office has a preference for hiring females more then males. it is clearly shown in the ratio of male to female employees.   \r\n\r\nGENDER DISCRIMINATION/ DRESS CODE :\r\n\r\nThe men and woman in this office are told that they have to business casual. Men wear slacks/dress shirt/tie and woman wear dresses/pant suit /etc.  \r\n\r\nThere is gender discrimination at this work place from my observation. The men are looked at with scrutiny when do not fit the dress code. However female co-worker can wear anything they want. I have seen some female employees come into work with yoga pants on. Not even a word out of management and its usually compliments that the person gets.     \r\n\r\nWomen also are promoted before men in this office.
