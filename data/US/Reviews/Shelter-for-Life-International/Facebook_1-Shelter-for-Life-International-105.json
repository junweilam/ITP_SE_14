The people of Senegal, Gambia & Guinea-Bissau are a joy to work with inside and outside the organization", "cons": "- Lack of structures - Organizational structures are there for a reason. It really is the wild west in terms of organizational structure. Anything can happen in the organization based on the subjectiveness or emotion of 2 individuals. It's not that policies don't exist, they are simply used for blaming employees when things go wrong; or if they are required for audits; or as excuses for limiting expenses Extremely high staff turnover rate - From Chief of Party, Consultants, Managers, Officers & assistants, team members constantly left the organization in the period of time I was there. - Toxic Work Environment - Any bottom-up feedback was met with yelling at best and a poor performance review at worst. The roofs of the Senegal office would leak during the rainy season and everyone was always tense. - Poor executive management - SFL's executive management team leaves a lot to be desired. There's barely any gender and disability inclusivity. Extremely poor communication and unnecessary secrecy. Constant blame games; Blatant nepotism; Office gossip being factored into performance reviews. Unrealistic goals setting and task assignment. All these issues are as a result of systemic poor leadership & management. - Lack of alignment with mission - SFL does not care about it's mission. Everything is done for donor funding rather than the project's missions. If you are offered a position there. Accept job offer at your own risk"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Excellent place to grow", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Manager in Dakar", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent opportunity to grow, implement proposals and bring results", "cons": "Often changes in the structure, system"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Community Mobilizer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Community Mobilizer in Balkh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working environment for getting expensive", "cons": "It has very bad time"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Male dominated company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Deputy Chief of Party in Ziguinchor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary for senior positions.", "cons": "This NGO is managed like a family business where small talk as more power that actual communication.
