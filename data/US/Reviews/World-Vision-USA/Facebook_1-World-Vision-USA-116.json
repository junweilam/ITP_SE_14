As far as the workplace culture itself, employees here tend to become good friends with each other since there's much less of a \"dog eat dog\" mentality than at a lot of other companies. Indeed, this is not a cutthroat setting; there is a sense that the organization is invested in its employees and wants them to succeed. At least on my team, there wasn't an expectation of working long overtime hours, which helped foster a good work/life balance. There is also the benefit of working for an important global cause rather than for a group of shareholders.", "cons": "There is way too much middle management there, and the organization can feel quite segmented.

My department or team would often have no idea what another one was doing \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 and we'd often have competing priorities.\r\n\r\nHere's my biggest critique, though: There's a pervasive paranoia among senior management at World Vision that the organization will be portrayed as \"not Christian enough\" by its supporters or the media. That, of course, is a completely unfounded fear. The organization makes no secret whatsoever of its Christian identity \u2014 anywhere, at any time ever \u2014 and you simply can't find a job description there that doesn't explicitly reference to the organization's faith-based orientation. Nevertheless, this paranoia fosters a culture where job applicants and employees are judged just as much by how \"Christian\" they portray themselves to be as how qualified or competent they are at the job they are seeking or doing. It was disappointing to me that excellent job performance often seemed to take a backseat to corporate and individual Christian identity. Who cares how often you claim to go to church or read the Bible or pray if you're not qualified for or competent at the job you have?\r\n\r\nAlso, the organization still doesn't hire married gay employees, and it prohibits sexual activity or cohabitation outside of the monogamous heterosexual marriage.

Rather, we should be thanking God that he would even use World Vision in the first place.  Chapel is sacred time, not a World Vision infomercial.  Announcements & such can be distributed via company email.  My team went through some \"reorganization\" this year.  The team was retitled in its job titles as well as rolls redefined.  In doing so, they announced that we would meet with a team lead & HR Rep to discuss these changes, and that all we had to do was to re-apply through the org's Intranet & submit a cover letter declaring intent for the new position.  It was also disclosed at that time that out of \"X\" number of people currently on the team, that a lesser \"X\" number of people would be retained.  It was also noted as a bit of a reassurance that those retained would be rewarded with a significant salary increase.  This really hurt the moral of the team as the team was now put into the position of having to compete with one another in order to retain employment.  This went on for close to 3 weeks until lay off notifications were disclosed to those to whom they applied to.  Along with that pre-disclosure, severance information was provided to each team member, down to the prospective final day of employment, how long their severance compensation would be per pay period, and the date to which they would exhaust, as well as the date eligible for filing for World Vision's internal Unemployment program (since they are a Non-Profit and do not pay into state Unemployment) and when that date would exhaust.  Most of the team agree'd that we would have rather maintained our current compensation rates & forgo the salary increases in order to retain our current team members.  This is where the children that World Vision serves can in turn, become an idol.  WV does everything in the name of hungry children.  What about my co-worker's hungry children.  What about the disruption of his/her family as they now have to consider relocating from the community that they've invested themselves in simply so they can acquire employment?  I've seen this happen with dozens of people during my time at WV.  Many of these people were there for 20+ years and found themselves laid off, only to have to relocate after a time of job searching because they had to relocate to where they could secure employment.  Many of these people were/are over 50 years old (higher medical risk bracket/401-k's with built up balances to maintain, higher salaries due to tenure).  Now the trend is to hire young people fresh out of college at entry level rates, but it leaves a vulnerable age bracket clamoring for survival.
