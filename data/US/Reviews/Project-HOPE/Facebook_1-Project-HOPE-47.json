My colleagues are smart, dedicated, and hard-working, and I genuinely like them as people, in addition to appreciating their steady commitment to advancing Project HOPE's work around the world. For HQ staff, we have a surprising amount of interaction with our colleagues in the field, compared to other organizations, and that really helps stay inspired to do our best.\n\nThe organization has undergone a transformation in the past few year, from one heavily reliant on GIK to increasingly impressive development programming, and the senior leadership team in constantly focused on growing our impact, funding, and recognition. As our development programming has increased, it has been exciting to see our footprint expand into more areas, whether mental health, or innovative health worker trainings in Covid prevention and treatment.\n\nOur benefits a few years ago were ok, but in the past couple of years, they have expanded and become very competitive. We have excellent paid time off (starting with 13 days vacation, 5 personal days, 3 floating holidays, 12 standard holidays, COVID leave, and last year, paid family leave was introduced, varying from 8-12 weeks depending on tenure.)\n\nI work in DevComms.

This is a known issue and is being addressed over time. But someone who expects to come into a position with everything laid out and ready for them, every process fully baked, will be disappointed. On the other hand, people who love to build things and solve problems can really thrive.\n\nLike working at other international orgs that respond to emergencies, it can be stressful to have work disrupted, sometimes multiple times a year, to pivot to an emergency response. It means other projects and efforts can go off track, and important but less urgent work gets delayed. It just goes with the territory.\n\nSeveral reviewers, particularly on 2/3/22, make demeaning and untrue comments about DevComms team members in their reviews. I am glad that they are now former colleagues, as their behaviors and attitudes are indeed toxic. Where I think the organization can improve on this front is to take action more quickly and forcefully when team members are underperforming or showing a pattern of working to maliciously undermine their colleagues.

Especially if you're a Communications expert or strategist who believes in best practices.\n\nThere is a serious problem causing toxic conditions, negative staff experiences and the highest turnover rates I've ever seen. Rather than fostering a spirit of solidarity, trust and collaboration, the team is managed in a dated, negative top-down manner. This culture favors a stunning degree of back-stabbing, pitting teams and good people against one another, weaving an \"us vs. them\" mentality toward colleagues (including toward Global Health, Health Affairs, others) rather than a unified, healthy fabric. Disrespectful behaviors and attitudes are the norm and condoned (don't be fooled by cheery group calls and emails that are performative, acting as though everything is fine when others are watching). In this culture, disparaging and misrepresenting people, their ideas, work and character are common, including existing staff (leadership team included) and people who left the organization. If you are accustomed to a professional workplace and normal standards of professionalism, prepare for culture shock.\n\nThis DevComm pattern began long before I joined Project HOPE. I was assured during interview stages that \"the old PH\" had some bad seeds who had to go, and that \"the new PH\" was cleaned up and full-speed-ahead. Unfortunately, the truth is that many talented, expert and mission-driven professionals leave because serious DevComm management and culture problems do not get addressed. \n\nAs 2020 reviews note, HR, Legal and the Senior Leadership Team, including the CEO, are well aware of the DevComm problems. Many concerns have been raised over recent years, prior to and during my tenure. Leadership did not respond to staff concerns, including from some highest performers. Many talented employees thus left over a relatively short time. This included: three media personnel in three weeks, four in four months (i.e. the entire media department). Other losses in 2021 included two great fundraising professionals on the Development team, beloved by colleagues. Other staff left in 2020. I understood a series of sudden, startling firings occurred before my arrival. It became hard to count how many people left DevComm.\n\nImportantly, there **are** several good, talented, positive professionals on Project HOPE's DevComm team. The toxic workplace issue is limited to an influential small few but has ripple effects that harm the entire organization. Staff can't understand why such problematic behavior is condoned, despite repeatedly flashing red on Senior Leadership's radar. Based on what one Senior Leader told me, the issue reached Board-level awareness before I joined the organization."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Amazing opportunity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Crisis Counselor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learn a lot\nMulti-faceted position\nTeam effort", "cons": "The only downfall is that this is a temporary program"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great organization, needs to improve in a few things, but is good!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Finance Administration Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good HQ enviroment, good benefits and salaries.", "cons": "Improve in proposal risk assesments and the impact on that for the project."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Global health department is super strong", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Global health department is stronger than ever\r\n-Work is intense, but personal time is respected and encouraged\r\n-Organizational strategic planning, DEI council, other initiatives are growing\r\n-Rapid growth is allowing for new processes\r\n-New CEO is aware of issues and is extremely open to solutions\r\n-EVP and CEO are experienced humanitarians and are not just fundraisers\r\n-Historically bad business model has completely changed under new leadership and org finances are looking good", "cons": "-Other departments need more leadership and investment\r\n-HR department is tragically small for an organization this size\r\n-Org lacks many structural elements for its size, including personal development, formal (and enforced) performance reviews, etc"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Polite", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Field Officer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Health and private insurance, and development for work", "cons": "System not well established yet"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Organization and Great Mission", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Mission; flexibility; culture; focus on people", "cons": "Going through a transition from the old ways of doing business to new and innovative ways.

Do not go work there, and more importantly do not donate your time or money to them. They have a complete and total lack of respect for their donors and employees. Employees are seen as disposable and treated with total disrespect.\r\n\r\nThe senior leadership team is without morals or ethics, they lack leadership and will buckle to the whims of a board who also seem to want to drive this organization into the ground. They're a group of misguided leaders who are unwilling to do the right thing this is particuarly true on the development team. The development team is always chasing a dollar without any real business strategy or plans of any kind and it\u2019s usually at the expense of their employees who are terminated, pushed out, laid off due to \u201cfit for purpose\u201d or other reasons that are generally without merit and are at the impulses of a reactive leader. Some of the \u201cleaders\u201d regularly ask for loyalty pledges from staff and balk when the staff won't commit themselves to the leader personally. This is the case most often on the development team. \r\n\r\nIn addition to their lack of morals, every one of these senior leaders of the organization are underqualified and not even welcome in the leadership circles of the Humanitarian Aid community. Some of the leaders spend most days playing a political game with each other usually focused on undermining their colleagues and creating drama aimed at getting direct reports to infight. HR is not comprised or lead by certified SHRM professionals and don't seem to understand basic HR principles, not the least of which include establishing a code of conduct, or, more importantly, confidentiality.  HR regularly shares private conversations with each of the aformentioned \"leaders\" when staff who - often in seeking solutions - rightfully believe they should be able to go to their HR department with concerns about the actions and behaviors of their peers and leaders. The nicest thing I can say about the general counsel is that she\u2019s overworked but without political capital and therefore bends to the urges of these other leaders and is often left to clean up their messes. \r\n\r\nEmployees are regularly berated, shouted and cursed at by the some of these so called \"leaders\" particularly in development and by other development staff who view themselves as \u201cabove the law\u201d. The organization does not hold its leaders accountable for their actions, which in turn has led to an \u201cevery man for himself\u201d cutthroat environment.  The development team is constantly jockeying to get in front of the board while also bad mouthing and fighting with peers and the CEO. The Global Health team is the only one in the organization with a leader who has any sense of morals and willingness to do good on behalf of the organization. \r\n\r\nBe sure to check Project HOPE\u2019s 990s carefully as they are grossly inflated and a completely inaccurate picture of the dire financial straits this organization is in. In-kind gifts do not equal cash!\r\n\r\nIn short, this organization will be run into the ground by an egocentric board and the reactive and chaotic nature of these incompetent leaders who are too busy worrying about themselves to worry about the well-being of a 61-year-old organization or its employees and the people they are trying to serve."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Pros & Cons", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent opportunities for people to get experience beyond what they would get in a larger non-profit organization.

Whether you are on the ground directly supporting an initiative or working in the Millwood Headquarters, you feel like you are part of something big. While I worked at HOPE, it responded to several disasters bringing supplies, education, and comfort to the areas it served.

A prime example of this is the Development Department,  as it's often referred to as the \"revolving door\" of HOPE, as it saw the most turnover of any dpeartment within the foundation.  A second example of this is the Information Technology team. During my time at HOPE, we saw the departure of  over over 75% of the IT staff leave in the past six months. that seemingly drove just about everyone out of his department.  Lastly, the organization seems to lack a finanical steward. \r\n\r\nIn my view, HOPE's staff,  particularly in the Millwood and Bethesda offices seem to have trouble staying motivated, which is likely related to the dark looming cloud of monetary trouble the foundation has continued to deal with. While working for HOPE, there were some layoffs and there was a constant fear of furlough.  While it's understandable that monetary challenges will lead to tough decisions, HOPE doesn't invest in its employees, it doesn't foster their growth, and it rarely promotes from within. If you are looking to grow yourself as an individual with an NGO and make a career out of, HOPE should only be considered as a stepping stone, not a long term employer."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great organization and mission, leadership challenges", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 May 2015", "job_title": " in Winchester, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most employees are good hard working people that believe they are making an impact on the lives of others around the world.
