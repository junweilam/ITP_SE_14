Many of the policies and practices are outdated and backward.  Employees are often asked to take on extra tasks with no reward.  Asked to work long hours with no additional time off granted.  Salaries are mediocre, which means there is a lot of turnover.  This is also due to a severe tendency to micromange - from the top down.  While it is true that this is a member organization, with the President being the only elected member of staff at the National Office, and therefore responsible to teh membership for all decision made at the National office, it's not necessary that every single decision be on his plate.  The staff needs to be trusted and allowed to show initiative."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great organization, interesting technology projects", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Dec 2012", "job_title": "Director Tech Products Development in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I got to contribute to several interesting innovative product development projects.
