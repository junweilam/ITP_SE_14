You don't have to look much further than reviews from previous stints to get a taste of the caustic and oppressive leadership style of Mark Viso. His ability to propagandize and construct messages that have the semblance of the historical mission of the organization, while slyly undermining it is as impressive as it is confounding. There is a reason that the only leaders that remain from before his installation are those that are beholden to him. Viso is quick to require trust and loyalty, and the last to give it. The stated mission and values of the organization only reside in those who haven't been pressured to adopt some twisted reinterpretation of them. And even those who might align with the need for \"transformational change\", are hardpressed to follow the tenacious, deceitful, and cunning way in which it is being carried out. Viso's methods have no place in any organization that ascribes to Christian traditions. The Board of Directors has humbled itself to be a student of Viso's expertise on all issues of governance, setting up an incredibly disastrous system of accountability. And they are his primary target for propagandizing. The warning is for anyone considering employment at FH to know that atop the organization is not a lion, but a hyena. Not a leader who inspires followers and participants in a compelling mission, but a self-aggrandizing and guileful mastermind simply using the platform to prove his own ambitions. Frankly, it's just not the organization you might think it is. (The CEO since 2020 is Mark Viso, not Ed Hatch - there is probably a good reason FH has been slow to update their profile)"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sad decline", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Rich history.

Because of that, the current staff are overworked and underpaid, teams are constantly asked to do more without getting more manpower, there is a lot of knowledge lost in transitions, and much of the leadership is inexperienced and unqualified overall. This means a lot of staff are very stressed but have their concerns ignored. Qualified staff, especially young and enthusiastic people early in their careers, start out excited but inevitably move on quickly and with a lot of frustration. If you are a young person of color or a woman, run! Your voice will not be valued and you will be asked to share perspectives and ideas without being able to act on them. FH is not a thought leader, but only responds to donors in order to keep up with what is needed, reactive rather than proactive. This is in part due to leaders who don\u2019t know how to do strategic planning and don\u2019t have leadership experience, so they focus on just maintaining instead of innovating. \n\nIt\u2019s also common to have decisions announced and then reversed. The COVID communication was inconsistent and confusing. When the new CEO was announced, a lot of staff had legitimate questions, and were basically told \u201cthe decision is made, so get on board or leave.\u201d \n\nThey talk a lot about a \u201cculture fit,\u201d which is often used to silence people who have critical opinions. It\u2019s also an excuse for not hiring more diversely or promoting women and staff of color \u2014 they are not a \u201cgood culture fit.\u201d The dominant culture is white, Trump-voting evangelicals. There are many who don\u2019t fit that mold, but the offices will be difficult to navigate because there is a big patriarchal (sexist) culture that elevates men as leaders and treats women as the helpers. There are now more women on the executive team, but that is very recent.

The intrinsic reward of working with FH is very great. And they have a clear mission, vision, and values that are communicated very clearly to the company. These align closely with scripture, and are inter-denominationally fundamental to all Christianity. There are several departments in the FH Global Service Center (in Phoenix) that work well together, and where quality has been steadily increasing over the past several years.\r\n\r\nSome departments have a work from home policy of one day per week after six months, and health insurance is 100% covered for the employee, with options to add coverage for the employee's family. FH has been steadily moving away from allowing working from home, however. So I'm not really sure how much longer this will continue to be offered.\r\n\r\nThe con (below) related to pay is balanced out by the better chance of finding a good work/life balance because (in my department anyway). They encourage employees to work only 40 hours per week. This is backed up by an hour for hour overtime policy. Every hour you work over 40 hours is credited back to you in comp-time off. This is generally handled on an on-your-honor basis but it is obvious when someone is abusing it because their productivity doesn't show it.\r\n\r\nIT management is reasonable, genuinely caring, and not deadline driven, which is a breath of fresh air in the face of other company's breath-taking inability to manage their own time, and trying to \"fix it\" by imposing artificial deadlines, which decimate quality, and relationships. In FH's IT department we can genuinely focus on quality, and our stake holders are understanding and supportive.", "cons": "Pay\r\nPay is not as competitive as for-profit companies because they have a hard time justifying to their board why someone should make so much when we always need more resources \"in the field\". This is an ongoing topic of debate in upper management, and it is uncertain what will be decided in the long run. Keep in mind that many of their employees work for less than what they would make anywhere else. And many of them are self-funded missionaries, and even a few un-retired volunteers. The majority are paid, just not competitively. It means you have to want to be here.\r\n\r\nDigital Marketing\r\nWhile I mentioned in the pro's section that the IT department is not deadline driven, the Digital Marketing team decidedly is. They regularly contrive deadlines that have no basis in business need, and cause quality to tank. There have been several tragic stories over the past several years I have worked here. Thankfully, many of our larger projects are with other departments that have more of a systems management approach that focuses more on quality and work flow than arbitrary deadlines for the sake of having deadlines.\r\n\r\nCommute\r\nThey have a strict policy of making sure anyone who lives 115 miles or less from the office (that's anyone in the Phoenix metroplex) must drive to the office at least four days per week to be in the office. This policy is short-sighted and counter-productive for attracting talent from skilled fields of discipline.

Communication from management was sporadic and not always aligned from one department to the next. No consistent management training available, so it is hit or miss if you get a good supervisor. There was a lot of intentional improvement at the top from 2011-14, but many initiatives that were coming to fruition were lost following the change of CEO.
