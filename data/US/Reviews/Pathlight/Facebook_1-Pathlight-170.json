many positive things to say about this company after over five years of full time employment with them. \n\nIt\u2019s a paycheck. You get paid biweekly. The clients are sweet and you can definitely make a difference in their lives. It helps to think about that instead of the insulting pay they offer and the power-tripping games upper management engages in consistently.\nThe majority of my over five year full time employment was spent walking on glass and eggshells, fully aware that my career in healthcare can be destroyed at anytime if I was to be chosen to take the fall for a higher up or if I attracted their attention in a negative way. I have witnessed this many times. \n\nPathlight offers:\n\n\u2022Decent health care packages for full time staff (currently offering Health New England)\n\u2022 Occasional modest fiscal year end bonuses for full time staff (not guaranteed, as employees, at least at the Lower DSP levels, received absolutely nothing this past 2019 year) \n\u2022Decent contribution to employee retirement investment accounts. \n\nThat being said, I would not recommend getting a job here to anyone I love, care about, or have any respect for.", "cons": "\u2022Unlivable wages. \n\u2022Sketchy money situations in residential management. \n\u2022Reportable offenses and serious issues often covered up by upper management. \n\u2022Almost guaranteed retaliation for reporting abuse and problems to higher up management and mandated DPPC reporting. \n\u2022Less than zero appreciation or acknowledgement for staff coming in, staying, doing well in their position, and caring about the job and the individuals we serve.\n\u2022Toxic company culture. (Ie. HR reinforces the idea that \u201ca paycheck is a reward for doing your job well\u201d and not a contract agreement made upon employment, which it is. Also a deliberate fa\u00e7ade that the 40 hours of state mandated Sick time they are required to give full time staff is one of their \u201cBenefits\u201d. \n\u2022There is no positive recognition unless done by specific program managers (which tends to be extremely rare) it is extremely common for hard workers to be taken advantage of often leading to burnout and resentment. \n\u2022Unrealistic company policies that are only enforced when it benefits the person/s in higher power positions.\n\u2022Very clear message that we are all replaceable.  \n\n*** This company has many past and current wrongful termination lawsuits. \nIn the past I\u2019ve seen many reviews on this site that spoke of instances of wrongful termination, specific illegal circumstances, and examples of disrespect from the company and they have all mysteriously disappeared. I know that several of those reviews mentioned individuals in high management specifically, by name. Those people are still working for the company. I suspect the company was able to submit requests to  the site to remove some of these extremely negative reviews on some type of legal technicality, (ie mentioning high management by name or claim of identifiable detail).\n\nPathlight was rebranded as such about two years ago after being known as \u2018The Association for Community Living\u2019 since 1952. It is suspected that the company underwent rebranding because the reputation was utterly irreparable. \nPlease note that nothing in this company since the rebranding has changed (to my knowledge) besides the name and logo."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "A compassionate group doing good work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Digital Media Specialist in Hadley, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Pathlight team is one of the most compassionate and hardworking teams I could have asked for.
