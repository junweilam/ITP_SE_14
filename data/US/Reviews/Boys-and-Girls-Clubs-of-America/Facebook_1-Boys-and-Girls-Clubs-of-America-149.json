I felt very much bullied and never felt comfortable enough to go above my supervisor to talk about the issue of her harassment in fear that it would continue to make the situation worse. She would make nasty comments behind my back as well as treating me with a large amount of disdain . She perpetuates a drama filled work environment. She seems to also enjoy being a bully. I wish I could have stayed but did not find it conducive to deal with someone who was so aggressive towards me. She obviously had a personal issue with me. I hope she can change her attitude one day. Could be a large reason why they have trouble keeping employees."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Tutor in Jackson, MS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everything was wonderful!

The kids want to have fun, they don\u2019t want to feel like they are still at school. The kids only went outside a handful of times while I worked there, and when staff asked if the kids could go outside, we were met with a \u201cNo\u201d, even on days when we would be open from 7am-6pm, they wouldn\u2019t let them go outside. There was a lot of divide within staff and management, often felt like sides were being picked. It was noticeable that there were favorites amongst staff with the program director, and often felt like the staff they didn\u2019t like was picked on. When things were brought to higher ups attention, nothing would be done. There was absolutely no discipline in the place for the kids. They got away with being disrespectful to the staff and the bullying amongst the kids was extremely out of hand. Once again, both things were brought to management\u2019s attention and nothing was done. It often felt like we weren\u2019t heard about our concerns that impact the kids the most or frankly, that they didn\u2019t care. YDS are part time employees and the countless of times we brought home work to plan things for the kids were unacceptable. When brought to their attention, we were told we could come in earlier, however when the time came to do so it never felt like we actually could. We were also told that if we needed supplies to put it on the supply list and they would provide it for us, despite putting supplies on the list there was only 1 or 2 times we actually got the supplies we needed. Most of the time our own money was spent on buying supplies for the kids. The lack of support from management with the kids and facilitating programs was evidently the reason why I left.

I\u2019m sure things are very different depending on where you are, but my location required us to do so many extra lessons that after-school club turned into an extra 2 hours of school. Kids already spend 8 hours a day being yelled at by school staff with hardly any break (at the school I worked at they only got a couple 15-minute recesses in the whole school day!) - what they need after school is leisure time for rest, fun, and socialization. They need the chance to exercise their autonomy which they don\u2019t get during the school day.

There was also a bit of favoritism/nepotism between the staff and directors which can be frustrating.  A few staff are allowed to get away with anything while not working, and at a place that is often understaffed, it is really important that everybody is giving it their all. At locations like this, expect a heavy workload and lots of stress while you pick up other people's slack. It is one of those jobs where a lot of children rely on you to be responsible as an adult, and someone has to be that person if other people will not be. When not everybody is helping out, there is more potential for injuries and incidents, which then make you look bad as a staff. It can be a frustrating cycle, but if you have good staff in your room with you, it is great!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Experience, will not do again", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Youth Development Professional", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible and can work around your schedule.", "cons": "Little pay and sometimes if you are heavily involved you'll get more work but zero incentive to do it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Childcare in Waco, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, great for a college student.", "cons": "Limited hours for part time"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "First Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Youth Development Specialist in Riverside, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a flexible job.
