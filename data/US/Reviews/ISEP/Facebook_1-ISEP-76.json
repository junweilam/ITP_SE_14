Upper management was not genuine and very hard to work with especially because they have limited business acumen. Most of the managers like that had very little work experience outside ISEP so this culture is all they know. It is like being in high school in all the worst ways. They promote people not on their hard work but on cronisim. Mansplaining was a regular occurance and the culture is not positive for women.
