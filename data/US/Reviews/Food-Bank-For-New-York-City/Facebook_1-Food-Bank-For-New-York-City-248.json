This organization is broken. I left after only a year because it is so very, very broken. I believe Food Bank is being run into the ground by the CEO, who (despite her terrific public speaking skills) is a terrible manager of people. In my heart of hearts I think she truly believes she is doing the right thing, which makes it all the more heartbreaking. I believed in her at the beginning. I was charmed by her passion and energy. I was inspired by the way she can wax poetic about how Food Bank is uniquely positioned to help solve the broad and complex problems of hunger and poverty in NYC. She had me fooled for a while, but it didn't take long for me to see her true colors. During my time at Food Bank, she routinely spoke badly about her employees and sent verbally abusive mass e-mails to entire departments, offering an abundance of complaints and threats but nothing in the way of constructive criticism. She created and fostered a culture of fear, which was funneled down to every department through the C-suite executives who walked on egg-shells at all times. High level employees (i.e. C-Suite, directors, and upper management) dropped like flies while I was there - you would see them one day, and literally the next day they would be gone with zero explanation about the reason for their departure. Speculation ran wild about whether they were fired by the CEO, quit from being bullied by her, or simply left in exasperation. When these employees mysteriously disappeared, no exit strategy was created by remaining staff, and lower level employees would routinely be found floundering under piles of new responsibilities they were often ill equipped to handle. Employee morale was low, and turn over continues to be high. I voluntarily left about a year ago, and there are very few of my former colleagues who remain. It truly breaks my heart. I wanted to love Food Bank. I wanted to stay for years and years because I believe in the mission of the organization. Unfortunately, the toxicity of the CEO ultimately sent me running. I actually overheard her telling her C-Suite executives that she wasn't the reason turn over was so high, but they were.
