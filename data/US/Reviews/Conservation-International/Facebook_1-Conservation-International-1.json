The founder and former CEO used to like to say that we are \"one CI\" meaning that all of the many components and locations of CI are working together toward a common goal. While I have enormous respect for Peter S, this couldn't be farther from the truth. CI is one of the most siloed organizations I have ever known.\r\n\r\nFor an organization that brings in A LOT of money from some of the wealthiest people and institutions in the world, they always seem to have money problems. They can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to host a board meeting, but can't seem to fund some of their mainstay programs. \r\n\r\nThe office environment at HQ can be incredibly stressful. Not necessarily because all of the jobs are so demanding, but due to nepotism (or some other poor decision making), many people are put into managerial positions that have no business leading others. Obviously this can happen at any workplace, but something at CI makes this seem sewn into the fabric of the org. I witnessed many of my colleagues either leave or betray their own conscience when put under this pressure.\r\n\r\nHuman resources is also a bad joke. Make no mistake, they are there to represent the best interests of the organization and that will never translate to what is in your best interest. I was once told by an HR person that the best way to get ahead at CI was to step on my coworkers and pave my own way.\r\n\r\nThat leads to another major problem with CI. They like to think they have this pseudo-entrepreneurial spirit because of how they were founded. You will constantly hear things like \"you can be the master of your own job, if you see a gap in our work, fill it and we will create that role for you.\" This may sound nice, and may have actually worked out for a few, but it is absolutely ridiculous. Back in the real world, people have bosses and are responsible for answering to the specific tasks they are assigned, they can't just go do other things that interest them.\r\n\r\nI worked at CI for nearly four years and I would be hard pressed to name a dozen tangible accomplishments of the org. This doesn't include the accomplishments of the smaller organizations that CI would grant money to, but the conservation work that actual CI staff did. Go to the website. Most things are very abstract, not really specific about what they do.\r\n\r\nCI has often been accused of \"green washing.\" I won't go so far as to say it is true, but I understand why people may think it.

Your boss will haunt your work and question your every move. Which seems odd because if they were busy doing their own work they wouldn't have the time to focus on yours at such a high capacity. Low level employees gather to discuss the horrendous behavioral trends from their bosses just to get through the day. Folks can harass and say things to you that are not appropriate in a normal workplace. HR is a joke and will only take the managers side of the story or act as though you have no idea what you are talking about. The issues are deeply rooted. You can't go to your bosses boss because he/she will just tell your boss. There is absolutely no confidentiality. Someone knows your pay, if you and your boss had an issue, etc. I was spot on a situation where my boss went to HR about me without me knowing and I had a gut feeling about it and later found out it was true. I couldn't defend myself at that point. The accusations were false and I felt that my integrity was challenged when I had never given anyone a reason to do so. I went to work everyday on time sometimes earlier and later than I should've and was still questioned.  You will be led to believe you are working at the best place ever by repetitive subliminal communications between you and your boss as well as other senior staff that have all been brainwashed. Most folks that have been there way too long do not understand the \"outside\" working world where people are not robots and are human and can make mistakes. You feel tiny in a world of Directors, VPs, SVPs, EVPs and Chiefs of....made up titles on top of titles. Everyone is looking for new jobs constantly because your own boss doesn't identify with your credentials or even pay attention to your previous work experience. Its like the knowledge that you have is washed out because the CI way is the only way. The review process is a joke that ties no accountability to your direct report if you did a poor job, but if you did well they will get your credit and you get a small percentage \"cost of living\" pay upgrade even if you worked your butt off. Each year your workload gets bigger and bigger and if you accomplish them all and do exceptional work they will find that \"one time\" you did something not to their standards and magnify that during your entire review just to make a credible argument for not giving you a significant raise. Nothing will be taken into consideration, like if maybe your boss was absent most of the time on travel or you had little to no guidance on a specific project....nothing. Oh! then that's where HR comes in handy and they can just say this is what HR thinks you deserve don't shoot the messenger bs. The best way to survive here is to put up and shut up around those vultures. Its a twisted work version of the hunger games in that place. You fight a battle constantly and no longer have a voice, you are no longer a human being and it will take a long time to get over the brainwashed antics, the harassment and the judgement and finally believe in yourself again."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Energetic and forward-thinking with a great work/life balance.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The ability to learn from many of the most intelligent and respected thinkers in their respective fields.
