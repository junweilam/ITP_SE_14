A few months after I began, the director of 20-years was ousted. I was working part time but pretty soon I had a full time caseload. I worked incredibly hard and often got positive feedback from families and volunteers (some of whom were board members, who told the CEO directly). I asked for a FT position and they said no. They hired a friend instead. Management exploited me, HR used my sick hours to cover up their mistakes, they gave jobs, benefits, and private offices to their less-experienced friends. They disregarded my safety - a would-be volunteer vaguely threatened me with a gun and management pressured me to meet with him anyway (I refused). When my son was injured and I had to take time off (thus my match support slipped - though I had been told not to focus on it so much), they took the opportunity to give me a work improvement plan. They ran me ragged and then told me I had a \"bad attitude\" even after being asked to mediate conflict between management and other employees. Obviously, I quit. JBBBS was about as far away from practicing the values that they preach. They were happy to bully, exploit, and disregard my wellbeing no matter how hard I worked."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great mission, terrible people and place to work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jun 2023", "job_title": "MMS/EMS in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supports need for mentorship Good concept Community involvement", "cons": "-TERRIBLE people(rude, disrespectful, inappropriate, snide, petty, judgmental, backstabbing,immature) -TERRIBle training methods:(lack thereof) -Disorganized -Lack of follow through -Lack of guidance, procedures -No self-awareness -Far behind goals"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Healthy Atmosphere", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Volunteer Engagement Manager in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A great team of people and the mission is incredible.", "cons": "salary is pretty low for a manager title and the work load keeps you very busy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Customer service", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative (CSR) in Islandia, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy job.

I have not worked for BBBS of Greater Birmingham since 2018 yet am STILL holding on to the contempt left by Sue. This should speak volumes about the culture created by her leadership. Upon hearing an update on how Sue is running the organization, it seems things have only gotten worse since I left. I felt it necessary to stand up for my former colleagues and the current employees still at BBBS unable to speak up. Due to board members being friends of Sue's it is impossible for employees to turn to anyone for help or guidance. During my short time at BBBS, I had multiple employees come to me in tears yes after being regularly YELLED at by Sue (along with similar accounts from former employees). Sue has created a toxic environment, and some would argue one full of emotional abuse and gaslighting behavior. Many employees are hardly paid livable wages, are yelled at and punished for things beyond their control, and I believe that after 25+ years as CEO, Sue is out of touch and a detriment to not only her employees but the organization as a whole. I would love to give more specific details but want to protect those that are still working there and doing justice to the wonderful mission. Please understand that I love the mission of BBBS and want what is best for the organization, volunteers, and - most importantly - the children they serve. It is for this reason, in addition to the ongoing pattern of troubling behavior that impacts individuals within BBBS, that I feel compelled to leave this review."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Continuing to build and innovate", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Match Engagement Coordinator in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- organization is working on building in more opportunities for growth\r\n- decent benefits and great time off\r\n- wonderful flexibility", "cons": "- low pay for high workload"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "\u26a0\ufe0f WARNING", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Program Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a job & Benefits", "cons": "Overworked, no work/life balance, low compensation, toxic leadership"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Fun job where you learn a lot!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Fund Development Associate in Camarillo, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-learn a lot\n-everyone's willing to help\n-able to work remotely \n-wear many hats in the agency", "cons": "-unorganized, but only at times"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Mixed Bag", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Match Support Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Ability to work remotely from home and flexible hours.", "cons": "Workload is high, too much focus on monthly goals rather than safety, turn over is very high.

To make things worse, a lot of front-line staff members have advanced degrees, so the pennies we're making aren't nearly enough to cover our student loan bills.  \r\n\r\n5.  Work-life balance: Managers often claim that they don't want you to work outside of your work hours, but that's near impossible given everything program coordinators and match support specialists are expected to do\r\n\r\n6.

It didn't start out bad, but quickly went on a downward spiral as I was there.\r\n\r\nManagement:\r\nLeadership- and I'm using that term very loosely- is a collection of people who at best are in over their heads and at worst have no idea what they're doing.   The CEO is disconnected  from the realities of the work and seems to only be driven by numbers. He doesn't know how to relate to staff or the students the organization serves.  Upper management provides little pushback to continued changes  and/or support for their staff.\r\n \r\nCompensation:\r\nProgram Coordinators,Match Support Specialists, and Enrollment and Matching Specialists  generally make $35-40k a year.

If you have a Masters degree, I would strongly encourage you to look elsewhere and please know your worth.\r\n\r\nSupervision/Support:\r\nSupervision and support form your manager is very hit or miss; you'll likely either be micro-manged to no end or left to fend for yourself. A smaller segment of managers have  somehow  incorporated both styles into their management. Managers are quick to delegate tasks but slow to lead.  \r\n There have been a few managers that were actually good at their jobs, but most of them have fled this sinking ship. You honestly receive the greatest support and coaching from your peers.\r\n\r\nCareer Growth\r\nTo be honest, there is very little room for career growth here. Management knows that the vast majority of positions are entry'level,  yet they do very little to help their direct reports grow professionally. In fact, they seem content with keeping you in the same, thankless position with no opportunity to move upward.  At the same time, they expect you to give them at least a month's notice before you transition out to something better. \r\n\r\nOffice Culture:\r\nWhile most of the staff is friendly, the working environment is pretty toxic. Upper management can be very petty if they feel that you are not in lockstep with them.  Microaggressions are commonplace,  while diversity and equity issues are trivialized.  The organization mostly serves children of color, yet the majority of staff providing direct-services are white women and that majority of upper management is white and male.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you are considering joining this team, I would encourage you to run, run for your life."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good place to work if you have a big heart and don't need a high salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Aug 2008", "job_title": "Enrollment Match Specialist in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with the mentors and mentees is one of the most rewarding experiences you can have.

They start you off at a low pay rate and make you believe there is a ladder to move up. However, promotions are far and few in between and raises are even rarer. Although most of the women in my office were kind, there were often times when I overheard dismissive comments about the LGBTQ community and snarky comments about one another. They work their new employees into the ground and wonder why there is such a high rate of turnover. As a young adult straight out of college, I learned that they target a younger audience in order to have cheap labor under the guise of \"getting your foot in the door\". \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, my market went through a few lay-offs and did little to motivate the staff that their jobs were secure. It became even more clear to me that this corporation was no longer looking to serve our youth, but looking to make numbers in order to look good on paper. The office became a popularity contest when new ideas were thrown around. If a person who was well liked did not meet their goals or do their job, they were given a pass and often were the ones who received raises when there was money to spare. \r\n\r\nWhen I handed in my notice to leave, the managerial staff abruptly asked me to change my resignation date due to not completing work that I had done. I was asked to defend my job after giving them hard work and dedication over the course of my 2 year period of employment. I was backed into a corner and was sent on my way in the span of a 5 minute conversation. Management does not care about lower level employees unless they are working above and beyond, often disregarding their mental health and work-life balance. \r\n\r\nThe company pushes recruitment of volunteers and mentors so hard, that the quality of mentors is often over-looked in order to reach certain goals. The majority of mentors that come in display a \"white savior complex\" and are not appropriately trained to handle certain hurdles a child of color would face. As a woman of color, I often tried to vouch for better cultural competency training for our mentors and staff but was told that it wasn't possible or that the resources were not there to provide such training. Again, this became disheartening as I truly feel mentorship matters only when it is quality. The managerial staff was predominantly white in both the corporate and market level, and often disregarded the problems our communities faced. Cultural training was only mandated at one hour per year, with few opportunities to gain more insight and little to no push to attend other trainings.
