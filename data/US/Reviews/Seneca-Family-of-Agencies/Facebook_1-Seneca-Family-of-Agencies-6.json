We help manage SEVERAL programs whereas a program supervisor oversees one. The QA department is not clearly defined as a strategy to allow the agency and programs take advantage of our role.

Having worked there for over 5 years, I left feeling very equipped to handle things that make a lot of other therapists nervous (CPS reports, police involvement, high levels of self-harm and suicidal/homicidal ideation, clients who are in intense emotional pain and at the mercy of broken systems which can make them violent and highly resistant).  The kids and families will draw you in (they are AMAZING), and the staff will make you stay.  They hire wonderful people - for the most part.  Also, a great place to get your hours and they are very supportive in getting people licensed.  If you find a speciality and want to get trained in it, it's likely they will pay for part or all of the training. If you are interested in moving up to supervisor and administrator roles, you can do that pretty quickly (within 5-6 years if you start unlicensed) and they are good about hiring within.  They have pretty excellent health benefits and the vacation is really good, too.  Pay is average for this work, so that means it's pretty low in my opinion, but no worse than anywhere else.  Some of the administrative teams really do appreciate their staff and try to show you with food and gift-cards and things. It's a good place if you want something fast-paced where you want to learn how to support youth in their darkest days, but expect to burn-out within a few years.", "cons": "It's a non-profit, so every position really feels like 2-3 jobs.  Hard to set firm boundaries to keep a work-life balance, especially now that things are remote, but some people are better at it than others (I was not good at this). My biggest issue is the lack of specialization and the way they seem to be more focused on expanding their presence rather than creating innovative programs.  This is not the place to really learn how to do structured therapy (CBT, DBT, ACT, EMDR, etc. They're just like: this is what trauma can look like.  Now go keep these kids from killing themselves and each other.) I think they might have been ground-breaking when they were established in the '80s, but now a lot of the programs feel like they are feeding into the problematic systems which keep their clients marginalized and dependent on this kind of support.  They talk a big game about being \"woke,\" and they hire plenty of POCs for introductory positions, but it feels like there's a lot of prejudice and racially influenced decisions going on in staffing the upper management.  The CEO (who you will meet and see around) has a good heart but he's been too removed for too long from the reality of the work, and from the lives of his employees.

They have a nurse available for employees. Excellent medical, dental, vision, chiropractic, and mental health services. Seneca is very thorough and they take care of their employees. Weekly 1:1 and group supervision is provided. Supervisors are also almost always available, and if it's after hours and you're on an on-call shift, then there's the Rapid Response Team who is incredibly supportive and acts as an interim supervisor (and communicates this with your supervisor later). Seneca offers ample CEUs and other professional development opportunities. Although I did not take advantage of this, but Seneca recently partnered with USC's online MSW program so that you can continue working at Seneca (and you'll still get paid and it'll double up as your required internship program), and have some (if not all) of your tuition covered. Seneca is truly an amazing place to work because of the supervisors, the co-workers, the opportunities to move up the career ladder, the work, the mileage reimbursement, the clients, and their family members.

Thank you Seneca!", "cons": "There is a high turnover rate at Seneca. I personally did not feel burnt out because I really optimized my supervision time, but a lot of my colleagues were exhausted and disliked being on-call. Although I didn't mind it, others might, so I thought it would be important to note that I had about 5 supervisors in the over a year time I spent working at Seneca. The supervisor turn over was due to promotions, personal leave, pursued higher education, and more (though I always had the Rapid Response Team if I needed someone). Pay is not great especially for the amount of work you do--if you speak Spanish or Vietnamese and you're able to pass the language test then you'll receive a pay increase. A lot of my colleagues felt as though they fell behind with the progress notes policy (completing notes within 24 hours of client interaction) in our wraparound program. Again, on-call can be exhausting (when I was there it was 24 hour shifts 3 times per month), especially if you worked a full-shift and get called out overnight (you do receive a stipend for that though). Although the orientation to Seneca is excellent, the job-specific training occurred way too late (I had worked at Seneca for 3 months before the conducted their formal wraparound training). By that time, I felt like I was thrown in without any training, and then when I got the training, it was validating that my work was on point, but that sink or swim style was not good.

When you have an experience of discrimination within your program your supervisor will do whatever for the client; client first employee last. It also doesn't help that all of the clients are people of color who can't get the help they need because 80% of the company is white and doesn't understand the struggles they are going through because they can't comprehend or understand it.

That attempt to be empathetic to the majority of their employees' financial distress is disingenuous and harmful, and the turn-over the organization experiences parallels the outrageousness of that claim. \r\n\r\nSeneca has money, but it spends it on expanding its programs - often at the expense of pre-existing programs that are already understaffed and underfunded. By the time I left, Seneca was coming up with a roll-out of higher pay for clinicians. That's great, but it still lags behind several other nonprofits and pales in comparison to what a clinician can be paid at a county position. \r\n\r\nSeneca talks often of race and diversity, but when it comes to management positions at headquarters, POC staff are passed over for new hires. Seneca is the type of place that will hold weekly Diversity and Inclusion events to discuss the lack of POC in management, and then when it's time to fill a new managerial role, look outside current POC employees and hire a white person. \r\n\r\nI believe that Seneca cares about the pay of their employees, and issues with diversity. However, when it comes down to making big changes, Seneca is very slow and ineffective, and incorrectly assumes that people should sacrifice some of their own well-being for its mission.\r\n\r\nThese are two big problems with Seneca, but there are many others, including life-work balance. If you can't set a firm boundary, Seneca will take over your life, and as romantic as that can sound as a nonprofit clinician/director/manager the reality is pretty bleak.\r\n\r\nSeneca can be a great stepping-stone, but for most it's not a place to build your career - whether that be because you'll continually be passed over, or you literally can't afford to stay."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great people and agency culture.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Seneca puts a lot of time and resources into training its employees.
