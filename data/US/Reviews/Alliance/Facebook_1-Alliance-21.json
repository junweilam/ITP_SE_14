You are ask to identify and meet underlying needs without a proper framework/therapeutic resources. Too much unnecessary fluff work. Inadequate supervision. Asked to do things for families you're not trained for. Mounds of paperwork and tedious meetings burdens already stressed families. Staff feel unappreciated, unacknowledged, and alienated. No room for upward mobility. Financial strain in the organization fosters an environment of high pressure for productivity/billing. You really don't do anything helpful in your role. You just bring people together families are already working with. Across the board there is a lack progress/meaningful change with clients. It's just a money-making scheme.
