Demand is clearly seasonal yet they do nothing to address this i.e. you will have nothing to do or you will be overloaded. They are not creative enough to come up with a system that keeps everyone fully occupied. They do little to address the tedium of the assembly line work. They blame inefficiency on the employee because they cannot see the ways in which it is structural. They are obsessive and micro-managerial about clock in/out time, breaks, and restroom breaks and will make you feel like you are in grade school- GIA infantilizes its employees. The work culture is bizarrely juvenile-again, like grade school. You will not be treated like an adult. There is obscene, visible, and potentially illegal nepotism- I know of two employees who had separate aunts in management- just in one department! What is this, the mob? The skills learned here are not that transferable outside of GIA; this is a career dead end. It will become even more so as they are attempting to automate as much as possible. I wouldn't bet on advancing within the company unless you have an auntie. Their handling of the pandemic was/is nothing short of a total unmitigated catastrophe in which they lied and miscommunicated.

GIA department hires professionals then demeans them publicly. A manager endlessly harangued a long-time employee in a department meeting for expressing constructive criticism, to the silent horror of onlookers; a manager publicly called another employee a liar. Beware the bait and switch, job duties not as advertised, titles meaningless. Once they get you in, they load you with menial tasks then call you uncooperative if you question your assigned role. Claim they are open to new ideas then either crucify you for offering them or don\u2019t give you credit when they use them. If one of the in-crowd is threatened by you, cohorts exclude, mock, and freeze you out. A colleague I liked and respected refused to talk to me for two months. Another colleague accused me of deliberate insubordination and inept carelessness in front of others. Ordinary quality control is reacted to as a crisis, as though finding normal mistakes (part of your job) is a huge disaster that requires placing personal blame. People only speak up in department meetings when called on, like in grade school. Discussions are at the granular level and incompressible to the rest, who tune out. Humorlessness (unless you think insults and barbs are funny), micromanagement, coldness (no inquiries about the wife and kids; no saying goodbye at the end of the workday), and ego-stroking of superiors reigns. Snark rules the day, and that\u2019s a standard set by managers who dis their own worthy and well-meaning staff and treat them like lackeys, children, or troublemakers.

I was a long-term Laboratory employee.]\r\n\r\n== Pay is low & less than industry standards. Most single lab employees have a second job &/or roommate.\r\n\r\n== The lab has employee production quotas that can be difficult to meet, & employees have extreme pressure for performance.\r\n\r\n== Employees are under extremely high stress levels that affect their physical & mental health. Employees also become paranoid & so fearful for their jobs that it affects their honesty, attitudes towards coworkers, communication, & interpersonal relationships. The stress also creates an unhealthy competitive environment & employee relationships to the degree that cheating, lying, \"playing the system,\" & backstabbing are very common to preserve one's position as well as get ahead. Many employees amp up on caffeine in order to meet performance demands. I'm told that employee stress has become even worse since I left.\r\n\r\n==  High quota demands force employees to cut corners on quality which suffers as a result. In turn, industry respect & trust in GIA has decreased as a result of product quality decline.\r\n\r\n== Management practices & treatment of employees is quite poor in some departments & is indicative of management \"culture\" &/or lack of training. Some upper managers use fear, threats, & \"punishment\" to \"motivate\" or \"force\" employees to comply with production demands & control their actions. This often causes employees to lower quality standards or react in unethical or unfavorable ways to meet performance expectations.\r\n\r\n== Management does not treat all employees equally, with definite favoritism. Advancement is often related to cliques and \"who you know.\"\r\n\r\n== When employees struggle to meet production goals & ask for help or training to improve, they are often denied or ignored, & their \"failure\" is \"facilitated\" by management, either purposely or by result of managerial apathy or neglect.\r\n\r\n== There is a high degree of micromanagement.\r\n\r\n== Lab employees' morale is very low.\r\n\r\n== Lab employees now work in a manner that is very \"automated\" & like an assembly line, causing them to feel like \"sweat shop machines.\" This has multiple negative results:\r\n     1.) Employees feel undervalued & treated more like machines or numbers than as people.\r\n     2.) There's a very low level of job satisfaction & sense of fulfillment.\r\n     3.) Lab production jobs are extremely sedentary & diamond graders sit relatively stationary in one position for long periods of time.\r\n     4.) There's a very high incidence of repetitive-motion related injury, especially carpal tunnel, & GIA does not handle employee injuries well.\r\n\r\n== Work schedule flexibility has been curtailed, & schedules are now very regimented. Arrival & departure times are set & inflexible. Lunches are only 1/2 hour at a set time of day & vary by work group (leaving virtually no flexibility for taking care of personal business or for coordinating lunch between workers in different groups. There is no time to go out for lunch). There's very little opportunity to take care of necessary personal business during the workday. Breaks are at set times, & breaks and employee \"downtime\" are very closely monitored. Employees generally feel as if they are always on a minute \"timer\" to a degree that is stressful. Any downtime (including work related) negatively impacts employees' production output while quotas are usually not adjusted to compensate. This adds to employee stress levels.\r\n\r\n== GIA has adopted the \"Lean\" business model. While good for increasing production efficiency, it's had some negative impact on employee work environment, job satisfaction, rigid structure, human \"automation,\" etc. \r\n\r\n== Employees often feel like production \"tools\" & not respected as valuable team members who can provide intelligent & valuable input. Employees' skills & talents are severely under- or un-utilized. This results in valuable employees not being used to their potential or in their best capacity. Employees are often not given the opportunity to grow into positions where their skills are best used.\r\n\r\n== Lab employees work in a darkened room all day. The light deprivation can have both mood & physical health impact for some.\r\n\r\n== Diamond grading job is repetitive, tedious, & mundane.\r\n\r\n== International travel can be negative for some, especially when it's \"expected\" that you travel repeatedly to the same or undesired location that may get \"boring\" over time or have unfavorable living conditions. Families are often separated for long periods of time. While overseas pay is generally \"better,\" the hours are very demanding, e.g. 12 hour days 6 days/week.\r\n\r\n== Lower-level lab employees' computers cannot send or receive outside e-mail, have no internet access, & do not even read portable storage devices such as thumb drives.\r\n\r\n== Individual workstations in the lab are required to be set up in a highly structured configuration with set locations for items on the desks & no personal items allowed.
