After being employed for one day, they fired the operations manager whom everyone agreed was a devoted employee. After working there for four days I was called into the office by the guy who freely admitted that the guy who got fired was a hard worker, and that now it was necessary to split the duties of the fired person between three people. That should have been a red flag. The guy in charge summed the firing up as basically not copacetic with the bottom line. He asked myself and another new employee what we thought of the hiring process and HR in general. We were honest about our misgivings with the job ad not matching the actual duties we were expected to perform. He sat there and agreed about issues with how HR and the temp company handled the hiring process. The meeting was over and we went about our work until I was once again pulled into the office to be told that HR thought that I was unhappy and so I would probably continue to be unhappy . I was fired because I was honest. And also because I have feelings sometimes. I would not advise anyone to even bother applying for this job.
