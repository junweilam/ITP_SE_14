Therefore, I began to read people before engaging with them. Additionally, I learned valuable lesson- sometimes you have to accept ''No\" as an answer, but no at all costs.

You will have the enviable position of being able to advocate with governments for major social change, lead campaigns that put children's issues on national and global agendas, put assistance where it is needed in the worst of times, and build long-term solutions in calmer moments. The organisation is gaining a new momentum and increasingly being perceived as a new player in a changing world.\r\n\r\nBut you have to work hard, and work long and sometimes antisocial hours, weekends, and occasionally during holidays (of which most staff receive at least 25 days per year). But that's the nature of international development work. It doesn't run to a nicely fixed schedule, and it's not the private sector or national government! That's why the work is so handsomely rewarded. If you want a 9-5 job, if you don't want to have to work very hard for your money, or if you don't want to have to move to a new place every few years with your family, this is probably not the organisation you want to work for. People say there is little work-life balance .. but if that's what you are looking for, you shouldn't be considering international development at this level. \r\n\r\nAlso be aware that consultancies at UNICEF are not the same as staff posts, and that's why the level of experience demanded of consultants is usually much less than for staff positions. And yes as a consultant you will have to have your own health insurance, pay your taxes, and you won't get paid for days you don't work - as is the case with most freelance work. This is not unusual in any business model.",
            "cons": "Like all large employers, UNICEF has faced its challenges especially in the human resource and administrative areas. New HR management will hopefully bring the agency into the 21st century and overcome what are known to be considerable headaches with recruitment time, unnecessary bureaucracy and slow processes. There is still some deadwood, mostly pre-retirement or classic civil service technocrats working out their time, but hopefully the organisation will get tougher and move people out of jobs they should not be holding. There is also a new school of mid-level managers emerging that is pushing for more efficiency and higher standards; but this is not the private sector. No sleep pods here."

Slow, inefficient and HR posts are held by people who have been with organization for too long with waning motivation and interests in making thing s more efficient and helpful for people. Most managers are promoted from their technical positions who may or may not necessarily have ANY management skills or background. Poor management is rampant but interestingly, once you make it to manager level, especially to Representative or Deputy Representative level, you can't be fired. If a Rep messes up in one country, there's no consequence, s/he is just moved to another country, same Rep job... No accountability whatsoever. Technical staff, especially mid-level end up working like donkeys with little or no career development path.  It's still a boys, medical doctor club in most offices. There's no mechanism to provide feedback. If you challenge management or disagree with the direction, there's no culture for healthy debate or discussion. Nobody wants to rock the boat and lose the job (they'll find a way to \"abolish\" your job if they don't like you) so people end up staying but miserable and nobody wins."

Most of the people at the company are passionate and very, very enthusiastic about social justice, women's issues and social issues, and have the energy to inspire others to help make things better in their community and the world at large. Working at Unicef means constantly being educated about world politics and problems, so it's not necessarily for someone who wants a set routine. The people are also keen on environmental issues, so offices tend to be very green and staff do so on a budget, ex. paper is printed on both sides; post-its are reused until they're ready to fall apart; heavy-duty curtains and caulking take care of drafty windows instead of full-blast heaters.",

Year round job opportunities don't exist unless you're living in the city where the main national HQ is. Even supervisors are hired on contracts so there's always this crazy learning curve where everyone adjusts to new staff frequently due to new staff coming on board and \"old\" (meaning more than 3 months) staff leaving as their contracts end. As a result, training can be sub-par depending on the manager. Screw ups on paycheques are normal, and you're not compensated for using your cell phone to do company business outside office hours, and getting overtime pay is as tough as scaling Mt. Everest without a Sherpa guide. Don't count on a job reference after your contract is up, as most likely your manager will be gone too as his or her contract ends, or you may have worked with 3 supervisors in 3 months. Work hours can be sporadic depending on the department's budget."
