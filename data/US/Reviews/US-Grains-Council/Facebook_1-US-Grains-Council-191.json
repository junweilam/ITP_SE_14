And the opportunities scale up very quickly, as long as you're willing to put in the necessary work--they are not given out for free, and this is to be expected. Provide opportunities and funding for furthering your own professional development. Perhaps some of the most interesting work and engagement that you can find in the job market. People are very nice. The current CEO listens to his employees and supports their ambitions and personal lives. And he lives the work-life balance, setting an example for his employees, so the employee doesn't feel bad about maintaining their own balance. In total, The Council is an exceptional place to work. For this reason, you see many long-tenured employees, coupled with other employees who leave for other opportunities and return later in life--a sign of an excellent employer.
