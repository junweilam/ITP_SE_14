When pressed, they'll tell you that front line staff have gotten lazy and are just not used to working hard which is why they feel overwhelmed. I can tell you for a fact that is not accurate, front line staff work harder than anyone there and make the least. This is a good example of the mindset the directors operate from. They put people in charge of departments who have no idea what they're doing and it definitely shows. This place is a great example of \"who you know not what you know\". Plus side, as long as you can kiss a** you don't need any real knowlegde or skill to succeed here. A lot of unnecessary micromanagement which decreases the overall efficiency of the organization and leaves lower level staff feeling disempowered. Working in animal welfare is very emotionally taxing work. Upper management does not acknowledge this and shames people for taking mental health days, tells people its unprofessional to cry at work (sorry that some people have emotions about things dying?). I've never had a job of this nature that shames people for experiencing emotions and taking care of themselves.
