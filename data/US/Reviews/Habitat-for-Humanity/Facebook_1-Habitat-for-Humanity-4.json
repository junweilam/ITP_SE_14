In 3 words: TOXIC. DYSFUNCTIONAL. MESSY. It\u2019s glossy on the outside and broken on the inside. Organizations can go through \u201cgrowing pains\u201d and organizational change is HARD, but how long does it really take to get an organization at least somewhat functional.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most questionable Places I\u2019ve worked, which considering how high their budget is and how critical the work they are doing \u2013 well, it\u2019s pretty alarming. \r\n\r\nIf you are not in the C Suite (or a white male), respect for employees is minimal. The lack of respect and empowerment for younger and/or newer employees is palpable, which is ironic because the CEO has a background in youth empowerment. The organization hires many incompetent people that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing or spends lots of money on addressing issues in ways that are highly ineffective, while sidelining people who bring skill, knowledge, critical thought, passion, commitment and solutions, or investing in their employees in meaningful ways. Professional development plan is non-existent, and employee performance metrics are unclear and Inconsistently applied. \r\n\r\nNonprofits have notoriously high turnover, but this has some of the highest I\u2019ve seen given its relatively small size. When pay and benefits are good and that turnover still exists, you know THERE IS A PROBLEM. This leads to \r\nextreme messiness and disorganization, which other people are then expected to magically fix, without the resources they need to do so properly. They are then berated when they cannot fix things. CEO is all over the place, anxious, and highly defensive. \r\n\r\nBoth staff and board keep getting more and more white, which is disturbing given its mission, where the office is located and who is served. Board helmed by an obnoxious, unimpressive individual, which again, given where the org located and the incredible talent in the Bay Area, is just confusing.\r\n\r\nDespite a relatively small staff and open floor plan in the office the org culture doesn't nurture collaboration, and communication is terrible. \r\n\r\nThe organization also suffers from an identity crisis \u2013 is it corporate? Grassroots? Community based? Faith oriented? An advocacy org? Strong social justice leaning? Who knows?!? It would change its identity to take advantage of \r\nopportunities without real conversation of what any of that actually meant for the work. This permeated down into the work culture, the way the organization interacts with the community, the way it administers its programs, \r\nand how it treats its employees. \r\n\r\nThe confusion, sloppiness, and unhealthy work environment were exhausting. Ultimately, this office gives a bad name to the brand. I wanted to love this job, but the negatives so outweighed the positives that it was nearly impossible to do so."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Love to serve with people who feel the same", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work culture is great, habitat Cincinnati does their best to make all employees and volunteers feel valued.

While our staff are exceedingly good at solving these problems, it often feels like management doesn't really understand some of the day-to-day implications of last minute decisions.

Lower level employees want to do so much more, but morale has tanked to the point of checking the boxes and keeping silent.\r\n\r\nOn the social and digital side, things are just as bad. It's like someone googled \"what is social media\" in 2007, and that was the beginning and end of any strategic planning.

Turnover is extremely high, and current senior management has no competency or experience in construction or real estate, which is kind of important for a homebuilder.    Most employees (managers and non-managers) with talent or applicable experience turn over quickly because they get frustrated with the lack of common sense and bad decisions consistently made by management and quit, or they question that authority and bad decisions and get fired for hurting someone's ego.  Since senior managers have no good experience in handling the business of Habitat, all decisions originate with board members, many who are very experienced and knowledgeable.  Unfortunately those worthwhile board members are busy working and running their own businesses, so most time, decisions, and involvement fall to retired, non-working, or inexperienced board members that are busy-body limousine liberals and treat the affiliate like it's their own pet project.\r\n\r\nIn my time there, I saw millions of dollars squandered in bad real estate transactions and in growing a bloated office staff that contributed nothing to housing production, operations, or raising money.  Despite the fact that we all worked in the same physical space, every small department was extremely siloed and there was absolutely no accountability in terms of an individual's role or work output.  As long as you talked the talk, you wouldn't get fired for not doing your job.  No one was really cognizant or interested in what other departments did, or how they needed to collaborate to get any work done.  Departments that did most of the real work and heavy lifting, such as construction and real estate, were chronically understaffed and unappreciated.  Much of the office staff would choose to \"work from home\" and come in to the office 2-3 times a week and be out of touch the rest of the time.  Some managers would shirk and take off months at a time just because, claiming disability for supposed accidents or injuries at home.     \r\n\r\nBeyond that, it was culturally very weird too.  Collectively we all knew something was dysfunctional, so managers would espouse in meetings how we could improve transparency, be more inclusive, and grow careers and reduce turnover.  The more this was being said, the more things were getting opaque with major decisions being made by 1 or 2 board members behind closed doors that didn't even know employees' names.  The new CEO who started last year liked to say she was instilling a \"culture of accountability\" but nothing really changed.\r\n\r\nDay-to-day amongst the \"little people,\" the office felt very much like a sorority house, replete with gossip, backstabbing, immature goofing off, and a general lack of professionalism.  Most of the staff were young millennials and suffered from special snowflake syndrome.  They were unable to communicate any worthy concerns or constructive criticism directly, and instead thought that going behind your superior or co-worker's back to complain was the appropriate avenue.  Anyone mature enough to communicate directly with a snowflake would risk said snowflake going to a corner to cry and melt over hurt feelings.  Human resource and operations managers would also abuse their power by trying to reprimand employees that weren't even under their supervision."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "I love working at Habitat.

Some smaller affiliate boards believe they can do things their own way, which gives rise to problems such as excessive debt, poor staff-board relationships, lack of fiscal controls, and more.  If you are looking to work for a smaller affiliate, make sure you have an employment contract, that the financials look good, and that your board of directors understands it is a working board -- and must put in some hours to help you. Make sure you recruit diversified board members from across the community, and avoid special interests taking hold -- for instance, all board members coming from a particular strata of society or neighborhood, group, etc. If it looks like too much work and not enough support, it probably is, and no amount of good intentions on your part will help.

The staff was dedicated and tight knit, the management trusted the staff to do their jobs, and the Habitat homeowners were treated with dignity and respect. Unfortunately, the CEO left and the new CEO, Maureen Sedonaen, changed my feelings about this wonderful organization to the point where I had to leave, as I no longer felt good about our day-to-day work. Maureen Sedonaen leads by fear and intimidation. If you\u2019re not 100% in agreement with her, she considers you against her. When some staff members were concerned about the sudden lack of transparency between staff and management (triggered by sudden layoffs), I heard her describe these concerns as staff members just \u201cbitching\u201d and \u201cmaking demands.\u201d Any comment about the organization is seen by her as a personal insult. A vast majority of the original staff members have left, many without another job lined up. During her tenure, the hiring processes have become questionable, with acquaintances receiving jobs and positions being filled before the job is even posted online. In the past year alone, she has hired and fired 2 CAOs, both of whom were terrible at fundraising and who never connected with the major donors whose gifts are so important to the organization. The lower levels of donations recently (a consequence of not having strong development leadership) resulted in \u201ccreative\u201d reporting of fundraising totals to the board and committees. This place is becoming sketchy.\r\n\r\nThe CEO\u2019s culture of toxicity didn\u2019t end with the staff. When speaking with major donors, Maureen would repeatedly exaggerate stats and make promises the organization was unable to keep. More than once I heard her discuss the Habitat homeowners in an incredibly disrespectful way, complaining about how many family members they brought to an event (those family members were acting as translators for their non English-speaking parents).\r\n\r\nSadly, what was once a distinguished organization with strong community ties and a dedicated staff has now become a vanity project for a woman who seems to have no empathy toward those less fortunate. I am hopeful that if she is fired or quits, Habitat Greater San Francisco can return to its former position as a leader in affordable housing.

They planned a company outing and had hired 2 buses to take the employees to the location. One bus driver was caught with no legal documents, the other almost drove a bus filled with many employees down the cliff. Joining this company can lead to you losing your life. Yet my manager complained about me not going for the outing.\r\n5. The manager would leave me with no task to perform the entire day and then would give a task at 6 in the evening, right when I had packed up and was leaving for home. Just plain harassment.\r\n6. As they are understaffed, as soon as I joined, I was given a lot of tasks and the previous employee was given hardly any work.\r\n7. A lot of the stuff I worked on was just deleted or completely disregarded. No communication was made regarding why the things I worked on were just removed by the manager.\r\n8. Was never given even a workdesk throughout my tenure of 1.5 months. I used to sit crammed between two desks, with no personal space or even a place to keep my things.\r\n9. For an NGO, it is ironic that most people who worked here, especially the management, are self-righteous, boastful and arrogant.\r\n10. No security person. It was risky working here till late, as any intruder could barge into the section where I was working.\r\n11. Was made to work even before my official date of joining. I was not compensated monetarily for that ever.\r\n12. The manager made me work on holidays, and when I would apply for compensatory offs, they would be rejected straightaway with no explanation. My manager, who was a male, would work till 1 or 2 in the morning and would expect women in the company to do the same, regardless of there being no security. The company acts like it owns you.
