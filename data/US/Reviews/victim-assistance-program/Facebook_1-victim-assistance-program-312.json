And she doesn't appear to be right for a management job in social services. The comment another reviewer made about Leanne having stated that she considered being a prison warden makes so much sense. A job in corrections or the military would be more suited to her.\r\n \r\nLike other reviewers said she doesn't take staff concerns seriously. She seems to think that the way to solve office culture problems is to fire people who complain about the problem. This becomes more toxic in the context of the fact that she has appointed _herself_ as the hr dept. If you're thinking that having the CEO be the hr dept is not standard business practice, you're right. That should never happen. If the boss is hr, it makes it difficult for employees to get help when the boss is the problem.\r\n \r\nIt's amazing that the board accepts her explanations of why there has consistently been _so much_ turnover during her time in charge. It's not just advocate positions that are revolving doors, it's across the whole organization. Few people stay at vap long-term and I think that's more because of Leanne than the nature of the work. As you can see by her responses here, her main thing isn't to improve, it's to justify herself.

I can say for myself that my mental health has improved drastically since leaving this agency. This agency is toxic and upper management is not good to it\u2019s staff and also engages in gas lighting behavior. Which is interesting from an agency that works with victims of domestic violence? Advocates, are held to a much higher standard than anyone in upper management.

When I was there, cultural humility was talked about once a year, in a mandatory training. where the President and CEO said she \u201cdid not see color\u201d. I remember leaving this training so disappointed that I worked for an agency that is so backwards. I honestly had hoped that this agency could possibly change but now as I continue to hear from staff about how they are treated I don\u2019t believe this is possible.\r\nSupervisors here micromanage to the point where I would receive a text asking where I was if I went to the bathroom. One supervisor in particular is the main reason in which I left. She is unprofessional and berates and yells at staff infront of other staff members. Her behavior is completely unacceptable and I mentioned this in my exit interview with the President and CEO and as I\u2019ve heard from current staff, she continues to do these things. No wonder the turnover is so high. Not properly compensating your staff and also not taking care of them, in a trauma informed way, is why the advocate team who is on the front lines has only one person with more than a years experience.

Supervisors would even ask lower level staff members to set them up with community partners they found to be attractive.
