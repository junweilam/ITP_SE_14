Therapy work with clients of YSS is meaningful and encouraging. \r\n\r\nYSS has offered financial supports and flexibility to it's staff throughout the COVID pandemic. They are very willing to work around staff availabilities and safety precautions. I was able to drop to part time status for periods of time that my family/life demands created the need for new balance.

The agency also has a generous PTO plan for valuing staff self care and family/self obligations. \r\n\r\nStaff are uniformly oriented towards missions for creating a welcoming environment of acceptance and nonjudgement. Staff practice patience, respect and professionalism with clients and their families. YSS connects newly licensed therapists quickly with free supervision to grow the community impact and availability to continue meeting needs.
