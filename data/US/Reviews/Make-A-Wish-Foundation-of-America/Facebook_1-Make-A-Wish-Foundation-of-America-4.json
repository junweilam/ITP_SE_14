Plus, many of the individuals who comprise the team are amazing. They care, and they work hard. For nearly all of four years working there, it's one of the most collaborative experiences I've had in my career with smart, talented and creative people. One of my absolute favorite things about this job was their investment in production equipment. With a Sony FX3, your videos will be top notch and they invested in a print quality printer, large format printer and cutting machine, giving you the opportunity to take a collateral piece from design to production. Working with the Brand and Marketing Team at Make-A-Wish America is amazing. There are some really great individuals working on that team who are always there to help if they can and to amplify the stories coming out of the chapter.", "cons": "Again, this review is for Make-A-Wish Northeastern & Central California and Northern Nevada specifically. For three+ years and throughout the pandemic, there really wasn't a lot that was wrong. I would say over the course of that time, our DEI initiatives were lacking. However, since really Spring 2022, the chapter has been in a state of flux. It has made growth opportunities harder to picture. Where it used to be senior leadership would have these conversations with their employees, that conversation for me was pushed back every few months with a promise to revisit the conversation that never came to fruition. So at present, growth in salary and role is stagnant to non-existant. But the main problem lie in the current CEO. They have a large ego, taking up an entire staff meeting to talk about themselves. At that same staff meeting a major announcement was made in the final five minutes which was an awful way to communicate changes that would affect colleagues and the chapter at large. The CEO's communication style is very apathetic as well. They aren't super interested in working with wish families during a wish (would rather talk to city dignitaries) and isn't particularly charismatic, which has resulted in poor performances at large fundraising events and even the loss of a few influential donors. More than anything, through a conversation I had directly with this individual, I don't believe they understand what the mission of Make-A-Wish is. It was the final red flag for me before I left and I did report to Make-A-Wish America which will hopefully mean it will be addressed. During my final week, I had a going away Zoom with my colleagues and it was so terribly nice to hear about the impact that my work has made on families across the chapter, and on my colleagues. Which is why it was very odd when the CEO walked past me without acknowledgement on my final day without saying good bye or thank you. Par for the course it would seem... Not convinced on the communication yet? Well know that benefits that were promised to us under the previous CEO, and the Interim CEO are being looked at under a fine toothed \"cost cutting\" microscope. Worse yet, the current CEO has cancelled some benefits without even announcing to the staff, including grief counseling, an amazing benefit that some were taking advantage of that was stripped from them without ANY communication. Embarrassing that one of my colleagues found out about this from the counselor and not the CEO who cancelled that benefit without any notice. It's either a lack of respect for the staff, or the CEO is so out of touch that she doesn't think about the staff at all when making decisions. I get a CEO's job is sometimes to make difficult decisions, but the lack of foresight and communication is exceptionally bad. As for Make-A-Wish America, the former CEO was incredible and we as individuals at the chapter heard from them often. Upon their retirement, his replacement, the Current Make-A-Wish America CEO, I'm not sure I've heard anything from them."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Mission", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 May 2023", "job_title": "Market Director in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Mission and caring volunteers", "cons": "Mixed messaging to the staff"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Wish Manager", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 May 2023", "job_title": "Wish Manager in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Love the mission and the staff", "cons": "Non-profit salary.

The few times I tried to share my concerns, I was brushed off. This poor leadership really effected my professional confidence in a way I never expected. - No HR Presence: Before I left, I did all I could to make things better. I documented poor situations I found myself in, and bravely addressed concerns I had with my boss directly and then worked up the leadership ladder from there. I didn\u2019t have one ally in that office though, especially because there is no HR presence, so think of it as a small \u201cmom and pop\u201d shop. - Low Pay & Benefits: My first red flag should have been accepting the job knowing it was already below market value for a fundraiser of my tenure in our area. I counter-offered, and was told the board wouldn\u2019t approve an increase. Should have run then.

MAWNJ and many other chapters can get away with just letting their burned out employees leave because there is no HR presence in the building. They hire out HR and as a result there are no representatives of the company in the office. Those who are trusted to communicate with the HR company, don't in an honest way. They filter through the problems personally and determine if you are being honest enough to report it. Many people have tried to make reports, however almost none were successful. Those who were, went to the HR company directly, once upper management found out the employee was railed. Employees are yelled at, asked to work overtime for no overtime pay, and told to come into the office even when sick.
