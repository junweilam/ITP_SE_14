During his tenure there has been a revolving door on staff - most damningly his own \"inner circle\" team. There was much talk of, \"it's normal for a new CEO bring in his own team\" and \"things will calm down once he has his team in place\" during his first years. Unfortunately, 4 or 5 years later, things have NOT calmed down in the least:  the opposite is true as both 20 year seasoned veterans and newly hired VPs and Directors have walked away or been dismissed. The instability created by all this puts both the organization and its students at risk. Biting off more than it can chew, the CEO drives and attempts to implement half-baked programs, marketing schemes, and processes. He pulls the plug on ideas just as fast as he initiates them. When he is in doubt and facing a crisis of attrition, the CEO simply throws money and titles at remaining at staff, promoting them to try to retain them. This has lead to major title inflation and a proliferation of VPs - leading to a deep resentment among staff about how and why these individuals got their roles. Performance management is a joke, bonuses are random and based solely on who toes the party line. \r\n\r\nThe senior leadership and the board of directors are engaged in a self-delusion that everything is going well and the company events and presentations are like zombie rallies with everyone smiling and clapping. There is never an acknowledgement that there are problems with the culture that need to be addressed. This is not a work in progress where we all have a voice. Lip service, propaganda, and free happy hours are key tools under the Pellow management regime.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when working for CIEE was a source of pride as it was the leader in its field. As our reputation has been systematically dismantled by the actions of the CEO, the board and the senior team, it feels like we are working for an organization in decline. Sure, powerpoint slides tell us periodically that we've never had more revenue. Then, on cue, applause is initiated. But how did we get that revenue? At what human cost? Putting how many students at risk due to overtaxed and demotivated employees? Crushing how many careers in the process? Scrolling through the list of names of board of directors on the website, anyone can see an accomplished group of business people, diplomats, educators. One wonders if they have any notion of what is actually going on here.

I would've worked for this company for years, but like all their talent, they have put me through so much BS that I am leaving now. This is how they treat all their employees.

Despite an absurd amount of instability towards the upper levels, I was able to interact with a lot of intelligent, friendly, and interesting people, and really enjoyed the friendships I formed with my colleagues. \r\n\r\nBenefits: The benefits are pretty comprehensive. Premiums for health insurance can be a tad expensive if you have to cover a spouse as well, but still manageable.

I've never been in a work environment where the situation seemed so deeply toxic at the upper levels. After a few years at CIEE, decisions made higher up the chain started to have a greater impact on my team. Our department seemed to constantly be hemorrhaging talented and qualified staff as they departed for something better. The CEO's reaction seemed nepotistic as he poached managers and leadership from his former workplace, and also personally hired people to fill roles that provided no clear benefit to the organization. Meanwhile, critical seats in our department were left unfilled for months upon months. Gradually, his idiosyncrasies became less of a troubling, if amusing anecdote, and more of a morale-crushing, train-derailing hazard. There seemed to be a fundamental disconnection between leadership, and what was actually happening - or what was needed - at the ground level. The CEO constantly viewed our team with suspicion, despite the team's level of knowledge, expertise, and passion for CIEE's mission. He often made far-reaching decisions without consulting people beneath him who would have been able to provide critical guidance, and as a result the whole organization suffered.\r\n\r\nDespite the interesting (but somewhat wasteful) practice of bringing employees of all stripes from its global study centers to Portland for its regular two-day intercultural trainings, the irony is that communication and respect seem to be a one-way street for many employees. This has become a workplace in which people at the lower levels (at least in my department) are expected to shut up, take orders, and never offer any substantial feedback to those above you.

Speaking as a former employee, I would never ever let my child participate in one of CIEE's high school exchange programs. They have very little regard for the participants'well-being (especially emotionally)  and do nothing to support host families.

Inevitably this model severely hampers quality and this comes across at all levels in CIEE programs; poor staff retention, incompetent management, failing program quality and lack of basic training for current staff on things such as health and safety.  I personally know some full time members of staff who do not know basic information about CIEE programs such as what the programs are called and how long they last/when they begin.  What's worse is that CIEE claims to to be best provider when anyone who has worked with other providers knows this is simply NOT true.  \r\n\r\nThere is also a clear culture of sexism and tokenism of ethnic minorities in the organisation and this is supported by both men and women.  This filters down into how some average white men are readily promoted as long as they bully and control/micromanage other people.  And this apparently is how CIEE, in embracing diversity, are setting an example for other study abroad providers.  In short, they basically lie about their belief in being inclusive to students from non-traditional backgrounds. It's pure marketing speak.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, I have seen people be promoted at CIEE simply because they do not complain and as a result there is a huge amount of title inflation at CIEE even at the lower levels where people with less than 2 years experience get promoted to managers.  It's a way of buying off people in their 20s and 30s.  What's more is that CIEE as an organisation is struggling financially to stay out of the red and the GI model is a way to try and combat this.  Hence why programs have been rolled out much faster than anything that would usually be seen in study abroad.\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of toady and unskilled people in CIEE and this comes across in how they promote themselves as the 'CIEE family'.  Anyone with experience can see that this is a way of creating an insider/outsider culture and incompetent and untrustworthy staff can hide in the 'CIEE family'."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Reviewer", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work was remote, and I could self pace.", "cons": "pay does not reflect experience expectation"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "A disheartening place to work.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Supervisor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Potentially extremely meaningful field\r\nInternational connections", "cons": "Unrealistic work load-saying don't work weekends but impossible not to work weekends or late at night to catch up.
