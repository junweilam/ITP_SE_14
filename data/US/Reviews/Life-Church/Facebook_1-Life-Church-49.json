Certain leaders who created a culture of fear, intimidation and bullying were not only tolerated, but promoted within the organization. If leaders get the results leadership wants to see, they got promoted, regardless of their competency to care for people.

The pace can be crushing, it can cost you spiritual health and marital wellness, but if the numbers are growing then God must be in it! - There seems to be a culture of retaliation at the highest levels. Unwanted feedback will be dealt with harshly. - In my opinion, there is a deep rooted fear of cultural backlash. Rather than stand for biblical truth, controversial topics are often avoided at all costs. - I believe that there are many pastors at locations who have little to no biblical competence, but as long as they have potential to be leaders (influencers) they are seen as more than equipped as Pastors.

I felt my hard work and passion for the team members on staff was recognized, not by my immediate leader but by the rest of the organization.

I took it in stride and saw the opportunity to help fill a gap, which put me under new leadership that was extremely toxic and what I could see the reason for the previous leader stepping off the team. I believe there were at least 7-9 terminations on the Staff Operations Group in the short span I was on staff due to leader I had. I was treated as a threat my entire time on staff, which made my working relationship with my leader difficult. In the beginning, I thought that this was something that no one saw and with how much I cared about Life.Church and the employees I knew I had to say something even if it ended in termination. What I unfortunately realized is that everyone knew and accepted it. I was told on several occasions that peers of this leader and even higher were aware of how toxic the environment was. I was advised to challenge this leadership and was met with gaslighting and even worse. This type of leadership where someone is looking for ways to get rid of you and tells you that or the most common saying in my one on ones which was \"I have enough to get rid of you, if I wanted to...\" caused everything to spin out. I became unhealthy and poured even more of myself into my work as a mom of toddlers, not my family. My marriage was not in the best shape when I came onto the team but that became the target for my leader to attack, my achilleas heal. I would go into one on ones trying desperately to seek wisdom or show what we were working on as a team and was met with questions about my personal life and assumptions that were not accurate. I often left believing the narrative I was told about my own personal life. When my ex-husband filed for divorce he was interviewed by my leader and a DLT member without my knowledge or consent. I was told directly after that interview that they would allow me to stay on staff as an exception, while rumors went wild with the personal information leaked by my leader. A few weeks later I put my notice in with DLT and made it very clear why I could not work under that leadership. It will go down as one of the most heartbreaking conversations of my life with the person I loved and respected the most while on the team and one of the hardest things I have had to do. I am now almost a year out and I am still hearing rumors of what people believe happened or were told about my exit by leadership. I loved my church before I came on staff, and I love my church now. I have a hard time walking back into the physical location of church and separating the immense hurt. I am flooded with memories both beautiful ones of lives changed and feeling the Holy Spirit so clearly moving in a room to memories of sitting at my leader's desk where I would leave in tears and anxiety attacks.

I'm a more faith-filled follower of Christ, better spouse and parent, stronger leader, and more generous person overall because of the impact working here has had on my life. Here are 3 areas in particular that stand out:\r\n\r\n1. Mission: I've never been part of a place where every single person on the team is fully committed to our mission of leading people to become fully devoted followers of Christ. There's something incredibly special when the entire staff is running in the same direction, aligned in their values, and full of trust for each other.\r\n\r\n2. Impact: I've never been part of a place that has such a far-reaching, global, local, and personal impact in people's lives. It's incredibly humbling and fulfilling to get to be part of.\r\n\r\n3. Culture: I've never been part of a place that has such a high emphasis on trust, transparency, feedback, accountability, personal and family health, and leadership development opportunities. We work hard, have so much fun in the process, and experience tremendous growth every day.", "cons": "The cons I tend to see people mention most here are 1) work-life balance and 2) pay. Here's why I don't have any concerns about either one:\r\n\r\nWork-life balance: This is really up to you! Let me explain: There is so much trust given in how we manage our schedules and workload, so each person really has to have the personal discipline to do that well instead of relying on the organization to do it for you. If you're someone who hasn't yet established healthy work-life rhythms, you're going to struggle no matter where no work. But if you're someone who has learned to manage your time and energy well, this is such a freeing, trusting place to work. My team is so great about working hard when we work, being fully present with family when we're home, and holding each other accountable to taking great time off to recharge. (For instance, we'll lovingly get onto each other if we ever see someone checking emails on vacation!) This is a place that highly emphasizes your personal health and your family\u2014but it takes you playing your part in that too.\r\n\r\nPay: Yes, you could get more if you worked somewhere else. If your top career goal is to make money, this isn't the place for you. But if your top goal is to use your skills and gifts to lead people to Christ, I can't think of anywhere better to fulfill that calling every day. I personally find the pay very fair and more than enough for my family to live comfortably. And when I add in the crazy generous benefits package (especially the 401k matching!), the healthy work culture, the development opportunities, etc., it's a no-brainer. It's an honor to me to get to live out my calling here AND receive such a high level of care through not just salary, but benefits, leadership, etc. For me, it's all a matter of perspective and priorities."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Amazing place to serve an amazing mission", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Central Team Leader in Edmond, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Amazing mission which really is the central reason for why we do everything we do.\r\n- We always say, \"family is our first ministry,\" which has made the work/life balance so much better at this job.\r\n- Really fantastic benefits.

Any concerns or frustrations are directed offline as employees are encouraged to take these to their leader. However, this sets the employee up to fail, as they are then labeled as another disgruntled employee or troublemaker. I witnessed retaliatory behavior from leadership in response to this, and many employees are eventually forced out due to \u201cperformance issues\u201d. In this way, the organization has progressively instilled (directly or indirectly) a culture in which employees cannot be fully honest (even in surveys/platforms in which responses are intended to be \u201canonymous\u201d) without fear of retaliation, which has led to highly curved positive results. This is deeply concerning, as the organization is mis-represented by the awards they win, and executive leadership has no accurate pulse on how their employees truly feel.\r\n\r\nThis type of behavior also personally impacted me under my leadership. Feedback I received was heavily biased and had nothing to do with my performance as an employee. My leader wanted me to be more like him/her, not more like Jesus, who seems to have been lost in the day-to-day operations of this place. When I escalated my concerns about his/her leadership, I was written off; from that point, each day became a more hostile work experience than the prior, as I was subjected to gaslighting, scare tactics/empty threats and passive-aggressive behaviors. I lived through frequent anxiety and/or depression (conditions I\u2019d never experienced prior to this job), and I consistently dreaded going to work.\r\n\r\nAs others here have said, this job starts out wonderful--the opportunity to work for your beloved church home feels like a dream come true. Eventually, however, countless employees leave because problems aren\u2019t addressed, expectations are unclear, and people get burnt out because they feel they are expendable (this belief is affirmed when hearing things like \u201cDon\u2019t let the door hit you on your way out\u201d and \u201cI could do this with only 100 of you\u201d).

From my honest experience over the years, the bigger the church got, the less you were able to be a pastor, and the more you were just an employee expected to meet expectations and hit your metrics. The more responsibility you were handed, the more the \u201cpastor\u201d title was blurred. When I started at LC, I was living out a calling in my life. The church was small, the focus was on people, and everyone had the same incredible energy. God was moving through me and I truly felt like I was making a difference, but somewhere along the way, upper-leadership, on the campus level and central level, shifted away from the people of the church and instead focused on the excellence of the experience and the numbers. They\u2019d never admit that, but it\u2019s 100% true. I didn\u2019t even notice this shift until I was in a high level leadership role. I took an honest look at the church and came to this realization. When I tried focusing on the people of the church and listening to what my employees, my team\u2019s volunteers, and our attenders needed, I didn\u2019t get any encouragement from my management, and instead my ideas got shut down by higher-ups for more \u201cnumbers-driven\u201d goals. This happened more than once, publicly (in front of other pastors in my role) and privately (in one-on-one conversations with my management). Eventually it got to a point where my job was no longer being a pastor, and instead my job was managing my employees as well as my team\u2019s unpaid volunteer leaders while also being delegated several of my boss\u2019 responsibilities, which never included being able to step up and simply pastor people. The burnout began to sink in, because I was no longer doing what I was called to. I lost all passion for the church and my role, and I knew it was time to leave. LC took care of me during my transition out, but to my surprise, I never heard from anyone once I left. All of my so-called \u201cfriends and family\u201d I met and grew close to while there never reached out to me. Even after reaching out a couple times to old coworkers asking to get lunch or coffee, I was blown off. There was one time when an old coworker agreed to hang out and they literally didn\u2019t show up and I didn\u2019t hear from them. Pity. Unfortunately, I am now looking for a different church and I don\u2019t recommend people apply for a job at LC. It used to be a fantastic company to work for. But unfortunately it no longer is. \r\n\r\nSome other cons are no work/life balance. If you work on a campus, you\u2019re underpaid and overworked with one day off a week.

Many of the online training courses are out-of-date, but no one has time to update them. It takes a back seat to immediate pressures.We need one place to go for current policies - all policies - not just the ones for a particular area.  And they need to be kept current as practices change. It can just be very confusing for those trying to adhere to them.  Also, new hires have it rough.

Instead they are a micro church with a MEGA vision! If you have never been a part of Life.Church this may be difficult to understand. Instead of building massive buildings and only having 1-3 services per Sunday, they start in a community and begin reaching people on a more personal level until a larger interest has developed. Then they build a smaller sized building depending on the area, and have services running on 2-3 days during the weekend. LifeGroups are also one of the primary focuses of the Church and they are done well!\r\n\r\n- 5 Things: \r\nLife.Church focuses on 5 things and works to do them VERY well. Many Churches try to do more than they can manage to try and cater to everyone. Within Christ centered and Biblical core values, the following 5 things are focused on and executed VERY well!\r\n1. The Weekend - It is clear that the weekend services are our times with a largest impact and reach so we emphasize the weekend because of the opportunity to reach the most people.\r\n2. LifeKids - Every weekend and every service, LC sees hundreds of kids entering in each campus with their families. LifeKids is a trusted place for parents to allow their kids to go for Spiritual development and confidence while the rest of the family attends the service.\r\n3. Switch - 6th-12th graders gather weekly to hang out with friends and hear the Gospel preached. After worship and a message intended to reach and grow the current generation, we split up into small groups to focus on personal discipleship on a more intimate level.\r\n4. LifeGroups - These are essential to keeping community strong and intentional relationships growing. This focus allows people to remain connected on a deeper level then one may experienced at a weekend service.\r\n5. LifeMissions - This focus allows for local impact on the communities surrounding each campus. Local mission opportunities allow just one more opportunity to expand beyond the walls of our building\r\n\r\nI have never felt so welcome starting a new job anywhere! And once on the team, you know you don't have to feel pressure to prove yourself because the interview process is so grilling and intense. Staff definitely make sure that they are only hiring excellence driven people who are called by God to serve here.\r\n\r\nBenefits are AMAZING!\r\n\r\nThe last thing I will highlight among to many options is the ability to stand strong with Church Online even in the midst of a pandemic that has temporarily hindered us from meeting at the buildings. This allows people all over the world to stay connected. \r\nI love working for a Church that makes an even bigger impact for the Kingdom each day than the day before!\r\n\r\nHonestly, Life.Church deserves 5 starts on every subject!", "cons": "With so many staff, it is harder to join the team and feel connected right away.
