The facade this company projects is a cruel deception that masks the deep-seated discrimination and racism rampant within its walls. Regrettably, my time there revealed an organization that not only fails to follow through on its diversity pledge but perpetuates a toxic culture that fosters discrimination against people of color (POC). From the moment I stepped foot into their office, it was abundantly clear that their purported commitment to diversity was nothing more than an empty marketing ploy. While they may boast about their diversity initiatives and virtue signal to the world, the reality for POC employees is a stark contrast. Discriminatory practices are not only prevalent but seemingly encouraged within the company's hierarchy. Racism thrives within the very fabric of CFF's culture. The toxic environment I encountered on a daily basis was suffocating. POC employees are subjected to demeaning stereotypes, exclusionary practices, and unequal opportunities for growth and advancement. It is a soul-crushing experience to witness colleagues with less merit and talent receive promotions solely based on their race, while POC individuals are consistently overlooked and undervalued. What is even more disheartening is the complete lack of accountability and action from CFF's management. Despite numerous complaints and reports filed by POC employees regarding discriminatory practices, their voices fall on deaf ears. The HR department, supposedly responsible for addressing such concerns, remains complicit in this abhorrent behavior by turning a blind eye and failing to take any meaningful action. The \"diversity pledge\" is an utter sham, an illusion designed to deceive potential employees and appease public scrutiny. The company's commitment to diversity is merely lip service without any genuine effort to create an inclusive workplace. It is an insult to the intelligence of POC individuals who hoped to find a supportive and equitable environment at CFF. My experience there was nothing short of a nightmare. The psychological toll of enduring a workplace rife with racism and discrimination is immeasurable. The false promises, the lack of accountability, and the complicity of the management have left me deeply disillusioned. I implore anyone considering employment at CFF to think twice before subjecting themselves to this toxic cesspool. There are undoubtedly organizations out there that genuinely value diversity and prioritize inclusivity. Sadly, this is not one of them."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good Place tp Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "19 May 2023", "job_title": "Manager in Bethesda, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice people to work with", "cons": "Salary could be better than it is"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great cause.
