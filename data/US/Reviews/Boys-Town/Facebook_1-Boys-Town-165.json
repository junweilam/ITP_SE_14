It did not include any information about how to handle the money in my FSA account. It was indeed a mistake made by HR and HR later admitted it. This mistake was very misleading to me. Because of it, I thought I could use my medical FSA money for the entire year of 2022 without any issues. I did not realize it was not the case until very late. \r\nAs a result, I lost all my FSA money. If I knew the policy before I left the job, I would spend the FSA money in a timely manner so that I would not lose it. BTNRH did not fulfill the obligation to deliver important information to the employee who was about to leave the job. I believe BTNRH has to be responsible for my loss.

Objectivity is extremely lacking. The company emphasizes \"accepting feedback\" however when ethics concerns arise around service provision you\u2019re more likely to be ostracized and reprimanded for pointing this out. While I come qualified with education and experience to work in the human service field this is not necessary for a position here. Boys Town emphasizes their 2 week crash course that you must attend in Omaha, Nebraska where they will attempt to cram the treatment model. (During my training one of the instructors thought it was okay to tell a story about an African-American male teaching to a youth about why it was not okay to use a well-known racial slur while she herself used the racial slur. I still do not know why this person thought that this was okay.  Also, when reviewing the benefits for the position in Nebraska we were told that it was cheaper for women to have a baby rather than be covered for birth control. Two statements lacking sensitivity/cultural-sensitivity delivered to a room of new-hires.)  The biggest issue that arises, if you choose to work here, is that you quickly learn that their CBT approach does nothing to address the systemic issues that the clients they choose to serve face especially in the District of Columbia.  The company is data driven instead of client centered. Their primary concern is that certain assessments are in the system within \"x\" amount of days and not whether or not realistic goals are set. This basically means that you just have to put anything in there so that their numbers are where they want them to be. Meeting the person where they are completely goes against the model. The program requires out of home placement for at least a year for the youth to generalize the teachings however they attempt to jam this in within 60 to 120 days.  A service MUST be put into the youth's life within 14 days of admittance whether or not they come in with services or if they're even necessary. There is no consideration for the environmental factors that confront the youth and their families. The belief that you have to throw a \u201cservice\u201d or a \"resource\" at an issue will produce lasting results is rampant. It\u2019s a cookie cutter model.\r\nOther issues arose around a lack of on-site training and supervision. While you are supposed to meet with your supervisor weekly to continue learning the model I did not. Upon my arrival my supervisor repeatedly told me that they did not know what they were doing and they started learning the position when I did. In 6 months I can count on 1 hand the number of times that I met with my supervisor to learn anything. You\u2019re completely on your own if you choose to come here is my only take-away and the sad thing is that the 3 people over you aren\u2019t doing anything themselves. You can attempt to go to them for answers but none of them can agree or no one wants to be the one to give you the wrong answer. The leadership staff is not supportive and show little sign that they communicate on all levels. Within 2 weeks of my start date at my location I reached out to HR to speak with someone about my concerns and did not receive any aid. I would reach out several times over 6 months and even filed an ethics review complaint with the national headquarters for any kind of support for the several incidences that arose ni my time on campus. Instead of support I was lambasted for what had not been done (despite the fact that I had been reaching out over the course of 6 months for any kind of help all the way up to the highest on site office.). This site does not care about new hires especially not if you are knowledgeable in your field. The majority of the campus in the main office has been there well over 6 years and some in the double digits. They \u201ccan do no wrong\u201d and they protect each other accordingly. The persons holdiong leadership positions in the company most likely began their career in human services at Boys Town and only know the Boys Town Model and not what the youth of the city actually face. They\u2019re constantly trying to place a square peg into a round hole. If you choose to come to Boys Town it should only be because you\u2019re fresh out of school and have no experience outside of internships and you need experience working with children. It is not a place for long term growth especially if you are an MSW, MFT, LPC or anything of the sort.

Dangerous situations where children are harmful to themselves and or others did not seem to get taken care of in a very professional manner. There were times that nurses were not available for heath situations. The job seems very impersonal to the children because the staff is required to use particular wording when speaking the children as the children are a on a motivational point card system. The negative aspect about that system is that the children easily learn it and are able to manipulate the system. A person can not be too empathetic when working with a point system and these children need more than a point system to fix their behaviors. Once these children go back into the real world situations, they do not seem prepared because they became so accustomed to the point system and structure."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Not a bad experience overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Youth Care Worker in Oviedo, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The whole staff, along with the majority of the management was supportive and friendly.", "cons": "As you're working mostly with troubled teenagers set your expectations accordingly.
