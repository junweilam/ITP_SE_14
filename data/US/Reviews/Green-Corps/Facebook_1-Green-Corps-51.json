The main issue about this organization is that they take feedback very poorly, driving young talent away from them and from organizing in general. As a non-profit, most of us understand their pay is not the most abundant. But it is extremely messed up that they seem to use this excuse to exploit young idealistic environmentalists. They don't demonstrate their support to interns beyond lip service - and you wouldn't know this until you're really in the program. Because of the pandemic, we were all paid the minimum wage in our respective states (until a sudden restructuring), and due to differing minimum wage legislation, we experienced massive pay and work gaps between employees in different states (20 hour gaps between some employee\u2019s workweeks), even though we were all hired on an equal level of work and expectations. It is unbelievable to me when I learned that they asked a Canadian intern to move to the US on a very short notice for a REMOTE internship and refused to pay for ANY of the visa fees or travel fees... during a global pandemic. The intern later on told us GC messed up on the visa and asked the intern to return to Canada on a short notice again. The level of mishandling in that situation just shows that they are unprepared to host a non-US intern. Another red flag to me is that they don't seem to foreground the work of communities or color or at least to address the legacies of white supremacy and exclusion in the environmental movement. When concerns on these issues were brought forward by staff, they weren\u2019t met with clear commitment to address them. I observe that a lot GC Alumni felt unequipped to lead campaigns addressing climate justice and intersectional environmental issues after their GC year. Related to that, the program makes it out to be the short path for you to work as an organizer afterwards but job-search is still difficult for graduated fellows, from what I have seen, not everyone who graduates from the program was able to find a job. GC's approach and tactics of organizing are seem outdated and it looks like they lost a lot of partnering organizations year by year.

I was beyond thrilled when I was first accepted. They advertised themselves as such a progressive program that taught young, passionate people to become successful organizers. Unfortunately, this is just not true. They purposely recruit and target young adults who want to make a career out of helping the environment, people, etc. The program preaches toxic ideals and values. They hesitate to acknowledge environmental racism despite the fact that communities of color are disproportionately affected by climate change (and so on). Moving past the topic of the organization's problematic views, they treat their employees poorly. There is no such thing as a work/life balance with Green Corps. You will work long hours and be severely underpaid. Yes, I understand this is a training program that is prepping their employees/ students for the world of organizing, but the neglect is unnecessary. If you end up not graduating from their program they then blacklist you from jobs within The Public Interest Network. Fortunately, TPIN is notorious for being an awful organization (so you shouldn't want to work with or for them anyways). There is so much wrong with Green Corps-- I'm sure I could go on and on, but I'd like my fellow colleagues to tell their story as well. My advice to people interested in this opportunity is: just don't. There are organizations out there that are genuinely progressive, inclusive, and care about their employees. I know a lot of passionate folks who joined Green Corps and hated it so much that they are no longer organizers and now seek other careers because of it. Green Corps likes to claim that their huge turnover rate is because \"organizing isn't cut out for everyone,\" but truth to be told the program is flawed and unethical. I tried to stay employed by them for as I could withstand it. I ended up leaving due to the evident decline in my mental and physical health.

I left the program before completing the entire year. It's also worth noting that Green Corps is essentially a department within the Public Interest Network. When you are researching this job read reviews about TPIN. Issues regarding pay and working conditions are similar across the network. \r\n\r\n- You get a lot of individualized attention from your Assistant Organizing Director (AOD). You have multiple meetings throughout the week with your AOD. The quality and nature of your relationship will vary somewhat based on your AOD. \r\n- Valuable classroom sessions. The classroom sessions have a lot to offer especially regarding the strategy behind organizing. Similarly, a lot of GC/TPIN alum still work in social change/environmental fields and genuinely have a lot of insight and perspective to share.\r\n-They work on environmental issues (e.g. endangered species protection, artic protection etc.). If that's something you're really passionate about it's cool to get first-hand experience on those issues. \r\n- The skills you get working on enviro campaigns are transferable to other fields (e.g more socially justice focused work). \r\n- Green Corps hires really incredible, talented individuals. Your teammates are great people.\r\n- GC assigns you a mentor who is a GC alum. If you get to know them, they can be a valuable resource.\r\n- You get healthcare, student loan assistance, and a few travel expenses can be pre-tax.\r\n- During a typical GC year, they pay for all your travel to work destinations.", "cons": "- AOD's typically have between 2-3 years of experience themselves, including their own Green Corps year. So, they're not as experienced as the program suggests. You can still learn from them but, they're not the only people you can learn organizing from. \r\n- There is a lot of turnover in AODs. They typically only work at GC for a couple of years. Depending on the staffing situation, there may be AOD turnover during the middle of your year. \r\n- The pay is very low and the TPIN will go out of their way to pay you as little as possible while having you work as many hours as possible. GC is currently navigating a new labor law (basically having to pay salaried workers overtime if their salary is below the federal minimum amount). So, we started the year being paid hourly. Our hourly pay was based on the minimum wage of our state. Individuals based in states with low minimum wages were asked to work 10-20 hours more per week than those in states with higher wages (to maximize their hours and pay equation). Midway through our first campaign, they switched everyone to salary (federal minimum) until the election. Everyone was asked to work 60 hours a week. People in states with higher state salary minimums were paid more.\r\n- TPIN and GC are not explicitly progressive. They work on enviro issues which tend to align with Dems. However, they are not progressive about pay, DEI issues, or working conditions. They also tend to avoid campaigns that focus on environmental justice. \r\n- Also see, @green_corps_speaks on Instagram. \r\n- This may be unique to COVID and the election but, the work we did was very repetitive and only allowed for a certain amount of growth. We phone banked between 4-6 hours a day. Organizer feedback wasn't really considered unless we had minute comments.\r\n-Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are not an important part of the GC program, even from a classroom training perspective. In two weeks of training, DEI was not part of the training. They claim that they try to prioritize diversity in their recruitment practices. However, when hiring AOD's (your bosses) they only hire GC alum who are predominately white. They aren't very accommodating of low-income staff situations. For example, we were asked to fundraise our friends and family, which was less feasible/appropriate for some. \r\n- A lot of people will leave the program if you stay for the entire year. Early on, some people will leave because organizing isn't a good fit. That's normal at any job. However, in my 2 months at GC about 30% of the class quit, some of whom really liked organizing. In the previous class, about 60% of people quit (the program did end during the pandemic, so do with that what you will).\r\n- GC avoids conflict by having conversations in small group or individualized settings.\r\n- The paperwork you sign includes an arbitration agreement and doesn't explicitly guarantee you sick or vacation days. (Although, ultimately they do give them to you.)\r\n\r\nUltimately, you are replaceable. Green Corps relies on annual turnover of staff. If you can tolerate some (sometimes a lot) of things you disagree with to get an experience you believe will help you in the future it may be worth it. If you get an offer at Green Corps, you can probably do better. They pick qualified applicants, and quite frankly most of them could get higher paying, better jobs elsewhere."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Mixed Bag: Pros and Cons", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Community Outreach/Field Organizer in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You are given lots of responsibility and control over the campaign that you start.

If you want to work on environmental issues, but perhaps have never organized before (or want to be a better organizer), Green Corps will definitely give you the training you need to get a great job with an enviro organization. \r\n\r\nBest things about it:\r\n*Get a diversity of experience:  In your year, you'll work on several different campaigns with several different environmental groups.  The campaigns will have different goals and tactics, and you'll be introduced to people from groups with different missions and organizational cultures. Great way to see what is out there.\r\n*Network with lots of leading environmental groups.  You'll likely work with groups like the Sierra Club or Food & Water Watch and others during your year, so you get to see first-hand what working for them would be like, and get to meet many people at those organizations.\r\n*Great trainers. Bring trainers from across the enviro and social change movement.  Not just GC alum, and not just enviro campaigners.  Lots of different perspectives in training.\r\n*Great staff.  Central staff is incredibly hard working and will provide you with lots of support.\r\n*Great friends/classmates: your class will have passionate, smart, like-minded people...people who you will rely on through the year, and stay friends with long after.\r\n*Alumni network: great support system and network for jobs after GC.", "cons": "Some of these are cons, some of these are just 'things to be aware of'...\r\n\r\n*Green Corps is not easy.  You will work long hours, and sometimes odd hours, including nights and weekends a lot of the year.  The point, of course, is to fit a huge amount of training and experience into 13 short months, but you need to be ready and willing to work hard and give it your all all the way through. \r\n*Green Corps is all about field organizing.  This means getting out in the community and talking to people, organizing community meetings, working with volunteers, etc.  Not a typical desk job. If you're looking to do research on X policy solution to climate change, you will not be doing that here.\r\n*You will move around during the year.  You'll work on 3-5 campaigns, and these likely won't be in the same city. You need to be flexible on where you're willing to live and work, and ready to go where you're needed.  This can be super fun, as you get to see lots of places across the country and meet all sorts of people, but can be a little difficult to pick up and move every 3-4 months.\r\n*Salary is relatively low.
