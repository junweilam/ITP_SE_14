First, they said they will pay between $15 to $18 dollars an hour, I thought me having more than 10 years of experience in customer service and a bachelor's degree in office Administration I will be put as $18. After calling over and over to HR to ask for the status they finally interviewed me and offer me the position for $15 I told them this was unacceptable since I was making $19 with AT&T and they told me everyone start at $15 and she was going to negotiate so the next day they offer me $16 ,because I was desperate to get out of the call center I accepted.\r\n\r\nFirst, you have no training I was given informal training for 2 DAYS to get used to the system and throw into the position. In NACA you will be the dealing primarily with people of color (Employees and Customers). which I don\u2019t have a problem with to be clear, since I\u2019m Hispanic and black but most of these people are ghetto and don\u2019t know the way to professionally behave in a work environment \r\n\r\nI was yelled at by one of the counselors for telling her that she was missing customer appointments and that was unacceptable as well as bringing family members to the office when we were closed to the public. I was also yelled at by one of the realtors for telling him to not remove the mask while inside the office I reported the incident to HR and my manager and nothing was done.\r\n\r\nOut of the blue, the CEO had a meeting with us and he wanted to turn the administrative assistance role to a call center role  from one day to the other with no training and no opportunity to do anything else. THEY HAVE PREFERENCE FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE, so those people were immediately moved out of the administrative assistant position into something else, I told them that I wanted to be moved since I quit my previous job doing $19  they give me the run around mind you that I grow out of the position also immediately and my local manager was very happy with my performance and the way I was managing the office \r\n\r\nHR TOLD ME (Saffron) to applied for the position so I thought I was going to be given the opportunity to be moved, I received another email for an interview on a Saturday uncompensated for the interview (most companies will interview you during business hours) i join the meeting and after a hour waiting they drop the call, i call my regional manager and told them what was happening and he told me will reach out so they can interview me. Another lady call me from HR and told me that i can\u2019t be interview because i need to have 6 months or experience with them. That is completely lies since they hire people from the street for the housing counseling position and most them quit before getting to the office because they realize what a horrible company NACA is.\r\n\r\nThey already have try to implement the new role of call center so you have the phone ringing back to back and random people telling them that they are in charge one of them kimberly worthy was micromanaging me and when i call her out she told me and I quoted \u201cexcuseeee me I\u2019m not micromanaging you yet\u201d so i also reported this situation to HR \r\n\r\nI missed work Monday and Tuesday because I was very upset with they Interview since they basically play with me.I was not answering the calls because obviously i was catching up with my emails and the customers request. I was handling a situation with one of the customer that needed spanish assistance and going over the document with him and because I put my Skype as do not disturb this lady the same as before send me a email stating that i needed to be available and if i can\u2019t comply to let her know obviously I couldn\u2019t see the email since i was using my two screens. When I finished i saw the email and reply suddenly i received a call from HR (saffron) again telling me about the Skype i told her what i was doing she told me it doesn\u2019t matter we are moving to terminate you.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the customer, NACA  is for people who will not get approved anywhere else, therefore be ready to deal with people trying to cheat their way into the program meaning having horrible credit score, no money, no financial responsibility ,no education, horrible financial habits like bank account with overdraft and nsf fees (basically they want you to teach them how responsibility looks like). They have a Facebook group where people\r\nWill comment everything that happen with them at naca and also they will post your personal information online like your full name and corporate email address so\r\nFor me that I\u2019m very private and don\u2019t like my personal information online is a huge red flag. Also they said that doing noise or escalating your case will get you approve, so you get people trying to do just that.\r\n\r\ncounselors without license $15 and people with license $10 plus commissions so they focused on people who they can help and can close the loan and pretty much ignored a lot of other people, they are constantly missing members appointments"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Beware", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Mortgage Loan Officer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great mission; helping members attain home ownership is great.", "cons": "Worst management I have ever seen.

The company likes to tout its proprietary software called \"Lynx\" which is supposed to insure privacy by not allowing any personal documents to be kept in the office - everything is scanned into the \"member's\" online file and then returned to them. Unfortunately many documents get lost or dissapear into a digital black hole. This is especially frustrating for members who are asked to supply the same documents over and over. A large number of members are Hispanic because NACA is one of the only places ITIN's (undocumented immigrants) can get a mortgage. Unfortunately there is a lack of Spanish speaking counselors and in my office the only bilngual person was the receptionist. This meant we had to rely on members to bring translators who often had English skills that were only slightly better than the person they were translating for. This made discussing complicated topics like mortgages, credit reports, bankruptcies, etc. even more difficult and miscommunication was commonplace.

As a Loan officer, you are force to do work of supervisors and managers in order for loans to close on time.

A golden rule while working at any company is not talk about the following 2 topics :  politics,  or religion.  The only thing the local office will talk about is  politics and religion;  in that order! A co worker will throw you under the bus one day and beg you for lunch money or your actual lunch the next day.  Also there was a lack of hygiene in the  building. I put an oil duffisor in my office because a client once complain about the smells coming from another co worker office.  When you leave the company they will try their best not to pay you for the loans that you qualified.  I had inform HR of labor laws to be paid for certain loans. They sent my check as a travel reimbursement,  HR probably didn't want the CEO to find out. The company is composed of over 90 percent of minorities.
