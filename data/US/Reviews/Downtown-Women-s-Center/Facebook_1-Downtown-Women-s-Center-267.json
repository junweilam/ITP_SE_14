No support for employees with good ideas in need of cultivating - it's a \"Do it right the first time or not at all\" type of environment - no room to learn, or if you ask questions, you're seen as not taking enough initiative or lazy. \r\n\r\nThey are doing a disservice to the clients by fostering an unsafe work environment for staff.
