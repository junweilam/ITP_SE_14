Had one and a half days of training with the \u201ccoach\u201d and was shipped off to the center to begin working. Was told that I should have had more training done and read books on how to do paperwork for children\u2019s files in the computer. When asking for help, I felt as though I was bothering the others in the center. Center was not staffed enough for teachers to have breaks and had to use the children\u2019s bathroom when no one could step in to relieve the teacher. Don\u2019t get me started on lesson plans, supplies for plans, not being able to print off coloring sheets related to the lessons ( God have mercy on your soul if you did!), and being told one thing by one person and the total opposite by someone that sits in an office all day and does zoom meetings. That person was supposed to come and evaluate me once a week for the firsts six months, but only had three evals done in five months. And I was expected to know my job like the back of my hand. All my evals were positive but with criticism due to lack of experience. I wonder why. This place is not a \u201chead start\u201d. It's nothing more than a glorified daycare started at the age of six weeks until the child moves on to real pre-k. If you look at all the available positions listed for STC, you have to wonder what is really going on within the company. Nothing is guaranteed to go in your favor, the children\u2019s favor, nor the centers favor.

Class issues in international development are well documented but are not considered within DEI discussions. Power sharing is being done from the bottom up, not the top down. They are unaware that they will not be able to reach their diversity and localization goals if they do not embrace a diversity of economic backgrounds, schools attended, lived experience, regions, ways of thinking and working.

Replacement staff are nowhere near as capable.\n\n- Massive internal confusion on how to execute against even the simplest of projects and objectives compounded with several new layers of largely ineffective or, in an increasing amount of cases, actively bad management\n\n- Ability to execute severely and negatively impacted thanks to a lot of half-baked and poorly-conceived work methodologies designed by people who don't accept much, if any input from those \"on the ground\" and who won't be (and have never been) doing the actual work.\n\n- Continuous internal reviews by management to understand why the latest work processes are failing without taking into account the input of those who are actually doing the work.

Unfortunately, the atmosphere was very cold, jaded and dry. People walked down the hall, turned their noses up at you and didn't speak at all. I'm a very social person and while I do not look to make friends at work, I expect the environment to be professional and cordial. Wrong again with this place.  I guess this attitude was passed down from the CEO because she was not friendly at all. She would barely acknowledge staff she did not know and if she did, it was cold and wasn't genuine. Fortunately, the Executive Vice President Carlos made up for that with his very bright, warm and welcoming personality. LOVED interacting with him as he was such a loving person.  They experience a HIGH turnover here too due to lack of donor funding, so if you are looking for a position with longevity, this is NOT the place. If you are a part of the business functions you might stay, however the projects come and go with the wind. The department I worked for was full of conservative, mildly offensive professionals. They were cold, rude and the VP acted as if he did not know how to run his department. The entire environment was just suspect and I would NOT recommend this place to work.

Either these \"lifers\" need to switch to another department for a while or start an exchange program with other NGOs, to get some fresh blood in there, but nothing will change until the senior finance folks change - and sadly, it doesn't look like any of 'em will leave soon. Westport isn't exactly the HUB for NGOs, ya know. Forget it if you are a woman! The top finance folks will use the passive-agressive behaviour technique to force you out.

Oh yeah, it makes it hard to have a disagreement with a co-worker if her husband is your boss:  can you say conflict of interest????!!!  Cut the nepotism and put a conflict of interest policy in place\r\n- Lack of transparency:  people are given promotions or new positions without a new position being advertised. As for hiring, if you are in a clique, don't worry about applying for new positions because you can earn a new position even if you aren't qualified. you just have to be in the \"clique.\"\r\n- Lack of follow up from HR when one interviews for a position. You usually find out from the Announcment Page when someone has been hired for a position for which you were interviewed. HR needs to get back to candidates BEFORE announcing who has been selected to fill a position.\r\n- Lack of direction with this whole Save the Children International thing - there has been such a lack of communication from mangement downwards; lack of planning; there are plans in place, but the senior management doesn't want to share with staff - like they feel empowered by holding information.

First, in December 2019 a mid-level HR staff member sent a note to all Save/US staff working overseas informing them that Save has dramatically miscalculated their tax withholdings.  In my case, the mistake was equivalent to 5 months of take home pay. This is but the worst incident in a long string of payroll errors I encountered. My pay has fluctuated between receiving paychecks that are literally $0.00 to a few hundred to a couple of thousand. This relates to a few issues around salary and benefits to Save/US staff posted overseas. Other errors have included paying benefits for months beyond the date they are supposed to be paid and then forcing me to repay for months...and then making errors on the number of months needed to repay. I personally caught many of these not inconsequential errors. Save senior management has evidently taken the advise of their lawyers and decided to not effectively help their employees put in serious binds by Save's accounting errors. This underscores the character of the senior leadership team that hides behind processes and fails to engage real employee complaints. Do not work with Save unless you  have savings and can weather the serious financial mistakes the organization can make with your pay, benefits, and taxes. If you want an idea of how Save responds to complaints, read the responses on this website. There's a lot of talk of wanting to hear issues and make change...but precious little real action. Can you go five months without a paycheck? If not...look for a different employer."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great mission, terrible management!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 May 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fairfield, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most employees are there to support the mission and are very nice people to work with.", "cons": "- Little to no upward movement for most people \r\n- People are not put into positions according to their skill sets and experience, but on a popularity or seniority basis\r\n- HR works for management and doesn't listen to employees\r\n- So anxious to fill some upper management positions, HR/VPs don't properly vet candidates"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Reviewing Save the Children in Bangladesh", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Deputy Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "> Friendly Work Environment\r\n> Various Employee Benefits\r\n> Cooperative Colleagues and boss\r\n> A good place to learn about project management", "cons": "> Short duration of project based employments.\r\n> Technological advancement still in progress\r\n> Less usage of modern ERP"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great expirience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You feel like you are part of a team and the organizational culture is very encouraging.
