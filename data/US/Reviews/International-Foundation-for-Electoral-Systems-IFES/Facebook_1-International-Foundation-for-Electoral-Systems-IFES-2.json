A meeting billed as a \u201ctown hall to solicit staff feedback\u201d started off with the president informing staff that a decision had already been made so their input wouldn\u2019t matter (that\u2019s almost a verbatim quote). The resulting uproar led to an IFES staff survey on return to office/work from home, the results of which IFES refused to release. The executives have bungled this badly and created massive amounts of resentment and poor morale. 2: IFES\u2019 Executive Team is trying to destroy IFES\u2019 staff union. The executive team spread disinformation, misinformation, and outright lies about the union in the run up to the vote. They also tried to disenfranchise staff from voting, and tried to force Country Directors to advocate against the union as well (luckily, the Country Directors told them to go pound sand). Since IFES staff voted overwhelmingly for a union, IFES has since fired union-member staff for made up reasons (and will now need to waste tons of money on legal costs to defend themselves), refused to meaningfully work with the union to address staff issues, and tries to undercut staff benefits as a way to make the union look like a failure. It\u2019s simply shocking to see an organization whose entire premise is empowering people to have their voices heard, work so hard to suppress the voices of its own staff and not even be shy about it. 3: Staff Turnover - turnover has skyrocketed as the smart folks see the writing on the wall and get out. Average tenure has fallen precipitously from 5+ years to less than one year. IFES touts its \u201cgreat benefits and pay\u201d but honestly, they\u2019re average at best, as their competitors have more than caught up over the past few years. In the meantime, as the executive team works hard to undermine staff and kill their morale, they continue to make the organization more and more top-heavy with people who make great promises but consistently fail to deliver. IFES is getting closer and closer to financial and operational failure, and doing nothing about it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Review from Senior Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Senior Manager in Arlington, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exciting work in election administration.
