You get the chance to expand your knowledge and apply it. Some examples:\r\n*Learn entomology while surrounded by invertebrates at Butterfly Biosphere. You learn to handle exotic insects and can even volunteer to work in an entomology laboratory!\r\n*Learn paleontology and geology at the Museum of Ancient Life. Similar to Butterfly Biosphere, you can work on fossil preparation and research! You can hold a piece of earth's history in your hands and know that you were one of the people that uncovered it. Pretty incredible.\r\n*Learn plants while conducting tours at Ashton Gardens (mainly during the Tulip Festival)\r\n*Learn many forms of play and keeping positive at the Museum of Natural Curiosity\r\n*Learn animal handling and facts at the farm\r\n\r\nAnd this is just venue work. There are dozens of programs you can get involved in to learn even more (3D printing, lasercutting, woodshop at the Makerspace; earthquake science in school outreach; music and early childhood psychology in the many early childhood programs)!\r\n\r\nThe other advantage? You don't have to learn anything if you don't want to! The inquiry-driven facilitation process allows you to simply ask questions and play without worrying about being the smartest person in the room. They hire people from every walk of life because the balance of knowledge, play, and inquiry shouldn't be the same from employee to employee, and they know that. They hire high schoolers (18+), college students, college graduates, people with normal hair, people with crazy hair, people with no hair, single people, married people, moms, dads, grandparent semi-retirees up to the age of 72. They value a full spectrum of experiences and what those experiences can bring.", "cons": "1. Pay. They hire mainly part-time for pay that is equal to or less than most of the food and retail places surrounding them. It is very difficult to get fulltime, and even at this level with massively expanded responsibility, raises do not keep pace with inflation the last time I checked. \r\n\r\n2. Professional respect. It is astonishing how often someone will say, \"You have the funnest job! (pardon the grammar, but that IS what they say)\" and when told about how we're hiring--mind you, this is while you are currently working with their kids in a competent and professional manner--will reply, \"Oh, yeah, but I have a REAL job,\" or better yet, the college student saying \"I'm GOING to get a REAL job when I graduate.\" They might assume the first point above, as yes, they do not give big boy pay, but the fact that they leave it to interpretation shows an alarming failure in diplomacy. Of course, anyone on the low-pay front lines--retail, food industry, customer service--would already relate to this I'm sure, without having fun at their job. So, this is hardly a distinct con for those starting out. And growing a thick skin and a permanent smile might itself be a pro?\r\n\r\n3. Mobility. This ties in with the first point. Higher level management directors and such have to work insanely hard to get their positions, insanely hard to keep them, and are not given industry competitive salaries. So, you have to have passion, willingness to sacrifice, and willingness to stay where you are, possibly forever. For some, that's great, we've had some part-timers stay for over a decade. That said, it acts as a great springboard to get jobs in the museum and education industry that do have higher mobility, as the skills mentioned in the pros do count for something."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "I Love It", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Explorer in Lehi, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love them people and managers\r\nFlexible schedules\r\nLots of variety so there\u2019s always something new to try", "cons": "I wish there was a full time position available for more hours"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Flexible", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 May 2022", "job_title": "Explorer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule, fun venues, and kind coworkers.", "cons": "Pay rate is not great"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Work Environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great people to work with\r\n- Positive mission and company culture\r\n- Nice customers", "cons": "- Somewhat unclear responsibilities\r\n- Seasonal late nights in the cold"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great place, bad pay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Gardener", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team members are great.

(COV-19 Based Review)", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Education Explorer in Lehi, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work can be very rewarding, while the job can sometimes be stressful it can really make for an ideal job for a full time college student. Flexible hours, overall great co-workers and the day to day job is really quite enjoyable if you like working with kids and families. In the education department there is so many amazing opportunities for learning and growth. Without this job there is so many subjects I never would have interacted with subjects such as paleontology, geology and entomology. It's great opportunity to explore interests or just get paid to learn about stuff you would not have otherwise. In education you also get to work at all 5 Thanksgiving Point venues. Giving you really great variety in your work environment. Though will spend most your time (at least at the start) at the Butterfly Biosphere or the Museum of Natural Curiosity. \r\nThe biggest perk for me for this job is it feels so fulfilling in comparison to other jobs available for most entry level college students. This job is refuge from soul crushing jobs in retail, the food industry and call centers.\r\n\r\nNote: With COV-19 still being a threat it is worth noting that some of the most enjoyable parts of this job, such as guest interactions have been severely limited and have been replaced by massive cleaning schedules. Staff hiring into any of the departments that work the floor of any of the museums should expect to do a lot of cleaning until this ordeal with COV-19 is resolved. There has also been a lot of effort to cut everything but employees when it comes to budget shrinkage due to COV-19. It's clear both Senior management and internal department management care about keeping their employees jobs.", "cons": "1. You will have an abundance of training (which you do get paid for) but while spending hours in training it feels like you aren't actually prepared for the job while doing it. The variety at the job is both a blessing and a curse. The con of that variety is that is hard for the department to specialize in training you for each specific venue. \r\n2. Communication is pretty bad, rumors are common due to lack of information from senior management and the specialist and managers in education. It's kinda of like the training's its not that communication doesn't happen, but it's just not the info that is actually important. (Though there has been improvements within the education department.)\r\n- With COV-19 this has been both better and far worse. Employees working the floor at venues got very little information as to how and why we are opening each Venues when we opened them. Especially the children museum. Which senior management was practically radio silent on when it came to informing employees the how and why of opening that venue. Senior management orginally stated they would not open that museum until Utah was in the green, then in the middle of June during the highest spike of cases (as of 6/18/20) Utah had ever seen they decided to open with ZERO explanation as to what changed. While there have been great efforts taken to keep both guests and staff safe there is has been no communication as to what happens if/when we have a sick employee or guest pr why we opened the children's museum in the first place. \r\n3. Stagnant pay. Small $0.25 cent raises happened every 6-8 months if your lucky. In the education department there was an effort being made by the department management to be better about timely performance reviews and small raises in pay but due to COV-19 pay increases across the entire company have been frozen. \r\n4. Going off point 3 the longer you work in the education department the more responsibility you get. It is not uncommon to become a shift supervisor or lead about 6-8 months in but you will not get raise for awhile after you become a lead. Employees up and down the ladder in the department often don't feel properly compensated for the responsibilities they have. A big part of why this is the way it is because we are a non-profit but sometimes that excuse just feels hollow.\r\n4. Due to lack of pay increases in conjunction with a dump of responsibility the longer you are in education employee burnout is a thing. The education department has had a gifted managed who has really improved the quality of things in the department but sadly employee burnout is still a problem.\r\n5. Educations management can only do so much. We are a small cog in a larger machine. Things that would fix a lot of these cons, such a proper pay increases are solely in the hands of people above and outside the department you work in. Senior management often feels like a distant but omnipresent force. During COV-19 there has been a wave of fear and paranoia about senior management watching over our shoulders and judging our work. There are rumors that senior management is looking jobs to axe if it comes to it. (This rumor may or may not be true but due to poor communication from senior management it is hard to say.) Education is trying hard to justify it's existence in a COV-19 world and fear among higher people in the department about what senior management thinks of us trickles down and puts stress on everybody.\r\n6. Lastly there is no paid sick leave and a COV-19 world that is straight up dangerous. There has also been no communication on what happens if/when a team member gets sick"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Non-Profit Fun", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Guest Service Team Member in Lehi, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of benefits for employees, including membership for entire family, discounts at events, restaurants, shops, etc.  Fun, happy place to work.
