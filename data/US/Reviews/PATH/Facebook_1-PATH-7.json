I have a lot of respect for PATH as a legacy global health institution with historical knowledge matched by few other organizations. But unfortunately, what remains of this legacy is bogged down but what I\u2019ll simply call willful ignorance. \r\n\r\nMost work I\u2019ve observed has been unsuccessful by most measures, and management appears willfully ignorant. Timelines are routinely delayed for fixable reasons, Sharepoint is considered a cutting edge project management tool, significant investments are funneled into a mediocre digital presence, document production is mired in endless reviews, and an over-zealous proofreading culture makes writing anything much more difficult than it needs to be (PATH takes pride in having their own internal editorial style\u2014which is just as ridiculous as it sounds: most companies are content using international standards, like Chicago style or AMA)\u2014the list of incompetencies goes on. \r\n\r\nOn some level this is to be expected: nonprofits can\u2019t invest in centralized processes like other international firms. The traditional donor model struggles to scale. \r\n\r\nHowever, the most perplexing part of PATH is how the organization appears to operationalize willful ignorance of inefficient systems. You could tell management \u201cno\u201d many times and provide clear feedback on ways to improve\u2014and all of it appears to go nowhere. And this happens with external groups as well: I\u2019ve seen donors provide clear directives like, \u201cthe sample size of your study is too small,\u201d only to see similar studies with the same sample size designed months later. \r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of a junior staff, I think this ignorance comes from prejudice: many \u201csenior\u201d staff have advanced technical degrees and probably believe on some level their education gives them expert authority. In a true culture of \"innovation,\" ideas would be privileged over experience. Everyone matters because everyone potentially has innovative ideas. But at PATH, the ideas that seem to matter are the ideas from tenured \u201ctechnical\u201d staff. If you don\u2019t appear to have the right expertise, the expectation is to bob your head in meetings, signaling quiet optimism and passive agreement with a smile. I\u2019ve seen PAs with global health degrees asked to do nothing but process documents and spend hours of labor on Sharepoint sites. I've seen qualified, smart internal candidates with Master\u2019s degrees denied promotions in favor of inexperienced candidates with \u201ctechnical\u201d Bachelor\u2019s degrees in Biology/Chemistry/Engineering. I\u2019ve seen \u201ctechnical\" staff quickly promoted to \u201cSenior\u201d level titles for no apparent reason. Meanwhile, some of the most motivated employees, with novel and interesting perspectives, are asked to sit quietly, take meeting minutes, and keep calendars for the \u201ctechnical\" project officers they support.
