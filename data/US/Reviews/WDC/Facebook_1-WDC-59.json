I can\u2019t think of more rewarding work that combines assisting individuals, helping families and building strong communities!\r\n\r\nThe WDC offers an exceptional work environment.  Although chosen based on easy access and a reasonable lease option, the office is beautiful \u2013 situated at the north end of Pike Place Market \u2013 we enjoy gorgeous views amidst an energetic part of our city.  Even more importantly, management has ensured comfortable work stations with state-of-the-art equipment to make sure we have the tools we need to be successful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to highly competitive wages, employees at the WDC are also fortunate to have outstanding benefits.  From flexible work hours to a generous 401K match program to substantial leave allowances to excellent medical coverage, management provides outstanding employment benefits!  I also appreciate management\u2019s concern about our safety.  One of the most considerate policies at the WDC is closing the office when the Seattle School District shuts down for bad weather.

New employees are frequently fired on the last day of their probation period (before they would be protected by union membership) for no cause.  This is usually due to the managers' blaming the employee for their own slip-ups or failures.  The one word to describe upper management at this company is quite simply \"inept\".  When managers are caught out in their own screw-ups they usually are quick to blame subordinates and take retaliatory action against them.  Needless to say, this environment has resulted in uniformly low morale among employees.\r\n\r\nCareer progression at the WDC is slow to nonexistent and job titles are not reflective of actual job duties but rather the pay rate at which managers prefer to pay the employee.  The benefits are good and the opportunities for time off for vacation, medical leave or other personal reasons appear to be good as well at first glance but often come with many last minute restrictions placed at the whim of managers.\r\n\r\nOverall, the WDC of King County is an organization that is the epitome of bureaucracy with multiple long ineffective meetings mandated by out of touch management.  This is truly a Dilbert company to avoid."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Intern", "job_date": "18 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Intern", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I am fresher and I like to give performance to my level best for growth of company today's competitive market", "cons": "I don't know my week point but someone find my week point so I should overcome it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Mine fantastic experience with IBM with the payroll of WDC to do the Bharti Airtell project", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Contractor, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Java Developer in Gurgaon, Haryana", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WDC provides chances to do the most challenging projects.", "cons": "Everyday you will get Challenges with the good environment."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Solid company with strong growth and future", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong executive management team, compelling roadmap and technologies and a great place to have on your resume.
