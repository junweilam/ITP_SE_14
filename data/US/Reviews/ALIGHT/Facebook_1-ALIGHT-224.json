Not very innovative nor creative in business practices.

Different sites have different procedures and policies.\r\n- At field level, there seems to be a distrust of local staff. Little is done to build their capacity to ensure that they can be developed. Local salaries are generally lower than other bigger NGOs which causes a fear of loss of talent.\r\n- Organization of senior field management seems designed for conflict rather than team building. For instance, Program Coordinator, Finance Controller and Logistics are all separate at equal levels.
