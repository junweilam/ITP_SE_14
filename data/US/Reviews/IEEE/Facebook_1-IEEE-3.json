When we were told to return into the office everyone was told only 2 days a week you could work remotely and some departments could argue for more. No consistency there making employees upset when others get more than them. Then we come in and NO ONE is even in the office so what is the point? They think everyone should be back in the office, but they don't realize that is the new culture being able to have more flexibility working remotely for home-life balance. There is nothing I can do in the office that I can't do at home. Give staff options Also it is hard to get a promotion here. Most of management has been here forever and does not plan on going anywhere. This makes it hard for those of who work really hard and deserve the recognition for it, to get a promotion. Or a nice thank you bonus could go a long way if you cannot promote. Titles do not translate outside of IEEE at all.

There have been sweeping Management changes that have trickled down to the employee level and made most individuals miserable.

Instead, the vague concepts are handed down to operation employees, who are then expected to deliver without knowing any background, strategy, or mission behind the ideas. Managers use to lead at IEEE, although more recently, it seems they are just passing along the flag. If the employee does not deliver, then no raise is given. Outsourcing has become a norm. \"Farm it out, as much as you can, even if it comes back wrong,\" is a direct quote from a Manager. Senior Management staff are very careful and quite good at the political dances, in order to make a good name for themselves. It's no longer a Team atmosphere.

There are serious management issues within the company and there is no change in sight. \r\n\r\nExpect to work 45-60 hour weeks with no overtime pay. You're expected to work overtime and during the weekends as needed, which is very often. Some executives and managers do not respect vacation time and have no problem contacting you while you are taking time off. So why bother taking the time if you're going to be nagged anyway?\r\n\r\nIn the past 5+ years myself and my co-workers have noticed things deteriorate drastically. It's a shame, it used to be pretty OK here. But speak to anyone in the hallway and they all have the same feelings.\r\n\r\nIEEE is run for the volunteers, they are the priority above everything. This means you must bend over backwards for them. Being cursed at or thrown under the bus by them is all part of the job and will happen frequently. They will blame you for tasks you were not a part of and not even your manager will defend you at times. Volunteers must be consulted before almost anything can be done, and most of the time they end up delaying a project or making everything extremely complicated or adding items to it. If you miss a deadline it\u2019s of course your fault, not theirs.\r\n\r\nNarrow-sighted executives are so eager to please volunteers, that half-formed ideas or projects are given the 'go ahead' before gaining input form any employee or persons familiar with the proposed project. It's not unheard of for one in the executive director position to green light a project that relates to a staff member's duties without even a mention of the project. The project will then run into issues down the road and you will be brought in to put out the fire, bewildered why you never heard of it before.", "cons": "Management & Human Resources don't seem to care about how you are treated by a volunteer (or co-workers), and don't expect your executive director to defend you from an angry volunteer either. Human Resources instantly takes the side of the company 99% of the time before even hearing the whole story. So good luck trying to make a case on how you've been wronged or how you are treated badly, etc. They simply won't care unless you maybe threaten legal action, maybe...\r\n\r\nThe management of the company will never realize the pure fear employees have of speaking to Human Resources. It's widely believed that whatever is said to HR always finds it's way back to the person you were complaining about. No matter how confidential they tell you the meeting is. Why? Well, in order to file a formal complaint, the accused person must be notified of the complaint. So if you are in a department the size of 5 people, it's pretty easy for you to be sniffed out. And if you don't file a formal complaint, it's swept under the rug, never to be seen again. So you either put your job on the line or you shut up and keep your head down.\r\n\r\nSome managers and execs often don't get along well, so be prepared to be stuck in the middle and be micro-managed to the extreme. Execs will often pin tasks to you directly and manage employees without notifying managers. This creates a stressful and complex web of tasks and duties from both directions with one party not aware of what the other party has been assigned. It seems like this is done deliberately at times to make you screw up or look bad.\r\n\r\nNumerous complaints have been made about those holding long-standing executive positions in select areas of the company, some serious. Word gets around. However years go by and everything is still the same. Those up top seem to stay there forever, everyone's feeling is that they get away with murder. Those on the bottom change frequently if they make too much of a fuss. Execs will be scolded by HR to straighten up and fly right, and they will, for about a month. Then things return to normal when your exec\u2019s phony happy & thankful attitude disappears quickly.\r\n\r\nIT staff are trying their best and are mostly fine, but computer hardware and software are outdated. Everyone is running Windows XP with locked-down systems so installing \"not approved\" software requires you jumping through hoops and filling out endless forms. By then you are halted by a self-righteous, know-it-all IT tech (who does not know it all) who decides you can't have it installed for some bogus reason (usually because of their personal feelings on the item). This is the year 2012 not 1999, get your act together! \r\n\r\nParts of the building have received a fresh coat of paint or remodeling, IEEE is obviously doing well and pouring funds into new projects. But none of those funds seem to be going to increase employee salaries or working conditions.\r\n\r\nOffice furniture that has been the same since the 90's was recently deemed \"too old\" by the big wigs. This meant renovations with smaller cubicles with no tall walls! With departments cramming more people into smaller areas too. Thankfully the negative feedback seems to have dampened future renovation plans of other cubicles, for now. Of course the big wigs who have these ideas aren't effected in their office, so why should they care?\r\n\t\r\nWe have obviously overgrown our building, but no serious action is being taken to take full ownership of our second building down the road where we currently only lease a few floors. You would think that with record membership numbers IEEE, they could afford to buy more space.\r\n\r\nIn all honesty this place is the standard office job, don't expect anything spectacular. They are after your ideas and talent with little to no reward. Did you just save the company big bucks by creating a tool yourself or designing some way to fix a project? Too bad, you may get a pat on the back (if you're lucky) but don't expect a reward or any recognition. This is expected of you. But don't worry, your higher-ups will probably take the credit for it anyway, but never the blame if it fails.
