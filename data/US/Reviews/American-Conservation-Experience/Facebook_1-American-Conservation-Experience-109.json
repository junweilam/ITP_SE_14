On my crew, one of the members punched someone out of the blue and he was fired but then he became homeless and hung around on the streets. One day someone forgot to lock the door before hitch and the project manager and director found him in housing during a check up. According to my crew leaders, incidents like this happen every now and then. The director didn't handle the situation very well.\n\nI was a part of a invasive species crew and we learned to use a chainsaw and spray herbicide but the work entirely depended on what contracts your crew got so I ended up doing mostly chainsaw work and no herbicide work.
