They talk a lot about how the organization needs to change to reflect shifting realities in the international development world, but have yet to enact any meaningful change. Many NGO reviews on Glassdoor will say that organizations lack \"room for growth\" - this is not only true anecdotally, but institutionally at PCI, as promotion freezes are endemic to their HR policies. Perhaps due to PCI's two HQ offices being on opposite sides of the country, internal communication is terrible (to the point where communication between DC and San Diego becomes antagonistic). Common processes are often either bottle-necked or require review/approval from an excessive amount of staff, making everyday tasks difficult to complete. As PCI continues to lose employees, management forces extra responsibilities upon those who remain rather than rehire critical staff.

The lower level jobs have a high turnover rate because there is always fear that people will lose their jobs. Since this is a USG funded organization, there are yearly budget cuts that determine whether or not your job is still secure end of year. Employee morale is low and office employees have cliques, depending on status. In addition, a huge problem of the organization is a lack of harmonious collaboration and communication. Teams do not communicate with each other and when they do, there is rigidity in change. Any mishaps are met with passive aggression and then leadership then wonders why employees are so unmotivated and unincentivized. Overall, I would not recommend working here, especially if you have a lot of drive and passion for non-profits. Working here will demolish that passion.
