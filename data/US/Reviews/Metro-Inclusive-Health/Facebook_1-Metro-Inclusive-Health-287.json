Metro employees are expected adhere to a standard of excellence in everything that we do, but rest assured that there are more than enough resources, and more than enough support to be able to do this. Fortunately, I have had an extremely knowledgeable, patient, professional, and encouraging team of directors and colleagues surrounding me, guiding me through every challenge I have faced, and assuring that I have a safe, judgement free space to learn and grow not only professionally but personally as well. My team has been extremely helpful with aiding me in growing my skill-set pertaining to my role and others, and has ensured that I am able to provide the highest quality service to my clients and the community we serve and nurture every day. \r\nWith that being said, my training and professional development experience has been everything one would need it to be in order to feel fully prepared to deliver the highest quality service to our surrounding communities. Pertaining to the role itself, saying that I feel blessed to be able to do what I am doing would be an extreme understatement. As an Outreach and Linkage Navigator, many times I have the honor of getting to be one of the first faces our clients see, especially when we go out into community to conduct testing and/or outreach. Understanding the impact this could have on someone\u2019s day, or the possible trajectory of their care experience motivates to give my best effort during every encounter.\r\n As an Outreach and Linkage Navigator, my role has a few primary functions which include rapid HIV and HCV testing, either in office or out in the field during outreach, assessing client sexual health risk factors and having risk reduction conversations, actively linking clients to any additional services as much as possible including linkage to PrEP, HIV care, primary care or behavioral health services, and assisting the client with navigating obtaining anything else they may need to help alleviate barriers to care, whether that is cost of care assistance, transportation, job and housing assistance, obtaining a phone, or even directing them to local food pantries to help with getting their most immediate needs met, ensuring they are that much more likely to obtain and maintain care/health services. As part of my role, outreach is also a crucial factor in determining how successful we are in engaging potential clients to help them along their health and wellness journey.\r\nIn terms of assisting newly or previously diagnosed people living with HIV, one of the most important parts of my role is establishing the client into care, and helping ease that process as much as possible. Whether they are newly diagnosed or have fallen out of care, it can be difficult for anyone to navigate this process, so it is my responsibility to not only obtain proper documentation relating to this, but to help the client find peace of mind through it all, by making sure that they feel seen and heard, and by making sure that they know we care about them as an individual, and want them to have the best experience possible. \r\nEverything we do at Metro emphasizes a client centered approach, and is at the core of our mission and purpose as an organization. In addition to this, we always aim to seek new, innovative ways to better serve our community every day, pushing the boundaries of what it means to provide quality health and wellness services that are inclusive, relevant, supportive, and represent the lifetime continuum of the people in our Tampa Bay community.
