Although given specific rules and guidelines to follow, management will override to accommodate board members or friends. Due to new set store hours store staff are unable to be full-time therefore no benefits, no requesting PTO, and barely accommodate sick days (you'll be lucky if they don't make you feel bad). Management will push for you to make all appointments on your days off. Coming from an unprivileged situation I couldn't \"text\" my doctor as they requested to ask for medical advice. They want you to finish all their tasks given on top of running the store but dissaprove of coming in too early and staying late. Management says they want you to take responsibility to run the store but will come down and start to take over, then come \"talk\" to you but only to say what they don't like about what you're doing. They say customer service is important but from my experience management liked to come down to the store at the busiest times to either watch you and not help or pull you away from a customer to \"remind\" you of a task they want you to do right then and there. The only cultural inclusion management knows is around Mexican culture. Once they have your phone number management will call/text outside of business hours and inform you late when deciding not to open the store. Management will brag about the past employees that were football players. They will refer to any male as \"muscles\" and thank them for lifting a leaf. Coming from a females perspective I've had no problems lifting anything in the store unless recovering from being sick but I got tired of management praising any male and no recognition for my efforts or entrusting me with any power tools, regardless of my previous carpentry experience and knowledge. I've put in many reports involving safety and recommendations but no changes were made or even talked about. Management will say they have lifting restrictions but will do so anyway and make you feel bad for them making the decision to lift in the first place. Doesn't matter how hard you work, you will be micromanaged everyday.
