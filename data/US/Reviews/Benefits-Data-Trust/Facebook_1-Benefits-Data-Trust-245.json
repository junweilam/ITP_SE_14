While being here, I have discovered that managers only hire their friends. I have seen many amazing BOS with an exponential amount of qualifications get passed over for an administration position, which is part of the reason why some of the BOS quit after working there for a short amount of time. Some of the people on the admin side had to leave and come back in order to get a better position.

Also, while the job can be taxing at times, taking time for your own well-being is supported; whether that be through taking breaks as needed, as well as being encouraged to use your PTO time (something that was not the case at my prior job).

One of the larger main cons with working from home is the inability to see people as they are working, so lately BDT is a little more \"watchful eye\" on the BOS employees which can feel stressful at times or like you are being questioned. However, almost all of our communication is through instant messaging which plays a factor, and just being communicative about what you're doing is an easy way to remedy this. Communication can be difficult, but for being entirely virtual with all of the tech issues that come with being virtual, the company still stands strong. Lastly, there is the possibility that you can be stuck on a call past your scheduled hours.

Often, they will interview a ton of BOS for an open position and then hire externally or go with an internal candidate who is not a BOS.

You can go above and beyond, have amazing calls, be on small teams and still only get a .50 raise. So you go from making $15/hour to $15.50, which just shows that your labor is not valued.

I had clients go on racist, homophobic, sexist rants, and more. Management expected us to take it without even blinking. If you show any emotion, you\u2019re told you\u2019re being judgemental/inappropriate and get marked down that you need improvement.  I\u2019ve had extensive experience in other call centers, and none of them worked like that. I repeatedly went to management with both proactive ways to both improve the overall office and to help us do our job better that required nothing out of them except listening and being respected as a person, only to be ignored. \r\n\r\nThe staff often are miserable to each other, doing things they know will harm themselves or those around them.  I can\u2019t entirely blame them. The majority of BOS are on the same public benefits they help others apply for. Get any three staff together, they'll mostly talk about how much they hate the place and the things they do to cope. Every time I talk to friends who still work there, all I can think is how glad I am not to be there anymore.\r\n\r\nEven beyond all those problems, they inflate their numbers. They pressure callers to apply with vague and incorrect information, and they get money based on the raw number of applications. They don\u2019t care if someone\u2019s already enrolled or ineligible. Just apply them anyway, let the caseworkers sort it out.  They\u2019re draining the resources of the already strained system by ineffectively using the limited resources. They don't take advantage of ways the workflow could be optimized, like using the most skilled workers for the tasks they're best suited for or encouraging people to apply with the most accurate information they can reasonably easily get. Like, if the wife handles the finances, she should be the one calling. If your niece handles your affairs, she should call in. But don't dare suggest it, or they think it's call avoidance.

I was very skeptical, very and wish I followed my gut.  Prior to moving to their campaign,  I heard how unstructured this particular campaign but heard it was a lighter load. While transitioning,  so was the campaign, increasing their outreach letters, calls, etc. Once I made the move the environment was completely different , no one really spoke. A lot of pettiness and betrayal was going on and ALOT OF MICRO MANAGING. As the time went on the work load got crazy , we were taking damn near 30 calls a day, people were exhausted draining all of their break times and running over lunch. We felt so unappreciated and small and it was clear their only goal was to increase their numbers and reach their goal. I learned how much they dont care about their workers, it took lots of complaining for them to do things like bring in donuts, lunch and for us to be noticed for all the work we were doing ( of course this came after tons of people quit or got fired). The environment is chill but very childish full of grown people who dont know how to mind their business, are interested in stirring drama,  or are dating one another. They dont respect your personal time and are penalized for taking longer than 3 minutes after calls to recouparate. The campaign I moved to is lead by the fakest human being I have ever met, she smiles in your face but will literally talk about you behind your back. The staff is super unprofessional, they weigh heavier on time management ( which they have a horrible policy that never works in your favor) more than the actual work that you do, they chose favorites for everything and are not realistic to the fact that their workers are human beings not robots. I would never work here, again! I wouldn't recommend it and in fact I was let go due to time management and I was so happy to finally have a peace of mind again! I dont regret leaving, I was looking for a way out anayways."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Fear Based", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Benefits Outreach Specialist in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy work most of the time.

This \" not for profit\" is run like any other private sector company so get ready to meet deadlines, sell things to people that don't want them and work really hard so that the Managment can get  bonuses and big salaries while you and your family qualify for the benefits we are helping people enroll in ( Food stamps & Medical assistance). The constant need to treat the BOS like children is infuriating , from the beginning of your shift a female team leader will literally yell \" it's 9am\" like a steam horn in a factory, in a tone that can only be described as stern kindergarten teacher, and order to make the working conditions seem easier people will give you candy and high fives in hopes of lifting your dismal spirits from being yelled at by strangers for 8 hours a day. At this job you will be micro managed in ever sense of the word, middle managers will watch and monitor everything you do, critiques will be given in the classic private sector style, \" meets expectations\" will be the most positve feedback you can get in most reviews, which you will have bi-weekly. Most of the BOS are overqualified to say the least , you will be surrounded by amazing coworkers ( best part of job) most of whom will not be promoted from within."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Place to Work!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Quality Coordinator in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The atmosphere is amazing, and there are so many kind and compassionate people that work here.
