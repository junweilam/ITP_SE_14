It is disheartening to witness situations where personal connections seem to hold more weight than merit or performance. Secondly, poor leadership that has resulted in a toxic work environment. The lack of effective communication, accountability, and guidance from certain leaders has created an atmosphere of uncertainty and frustration. This has hindered our collective ability to perform optimally and contribute to the organization's success. Furthermore, I have experienced a lack of support from the Human Resources department when attempting to address workplace concerns. It is crucial for HR to provide a safe and supportive environment for employees to voice their concerns without fear of reprisal. Unfortunately, my attempts to seek assistance and resolution have been met with indifference, which only perpetuates the existing problems. Also, I have noticed instances of retaliation against employees who have raised valid concerns or acted as whistleblowers. This discourages open dialogue, hampers trust, and perpetuates a culture of silence. A system that supports and protects employees who come forward with genuine concerns is essential to promoting a healthy and transparent work environment. Lastly, I am disappointed by the lack of clear paths for professional advancement within the organization. It often appears that opportunities for growth and development are limited to those who maintain close relationships with management, rather than being based on merit and potential. This creates a sense of frustration and hampers the motivation of ambitious employees who strive to contribute more to the organization."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "It\u2019s all Peer-to-Peer Event fundraising", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 May 2023", "job_title": "Executive Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I loved working with the breast cancer community.
