At least on my team, colleagues are respectful of a work-life balance and working remotely.", "cons": "Overall, the organization does a disservice to itself by splitting the work into humanitarian vs. development settings. This means two people working on, say, food security, might never collaborate or learn from each other, if they are working in different settings. Countries don't neatly divide into either development or emergency situations- they are fluid, and some are mostly stable with an emergency in just one part of the country. So why does CARE still insist on taking this approach? It causes confusion, competition, territorialism, and duplication of efforts.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1) Because the international structure is confederated (most countries' CARE offices are independent) there is very little cohesion, communication/collaboration between technical teams or across countries, and a lot of duplication of efforts. It is hard to manage quality when each country is more or less left to its own devices, but still represents that CARE brand.\n\n2) The monitoring and evaluation systems are just terrible. CARE needs a modern digital platform to track, analyze, visualize and report data. I am a data person used to working with numbers, but I cannot make sense of CARE's system and it's difficult to pull a single statistic from all the confusing databases and dashboards. The M&E staff are prickly and not very helpful.\n\n3) I adored CARE's HR until I had a baby. I spent my ENTIRE pregnancy and four months after the birth of my child trying to figure out how much maternity leave I could take. I got conflicting and incorrect information from each HR person I spoke with. Part of this is because the United States has a patchwork of parental leave polices that differ across states, but the HR leave representative was unwilling to read a two-page document about the paid leave available where I live. I spent probably 150 hours on the phone/email/internet trying to get the leave I was entitled to. In the end my boss intervened and gave me an extremely generous leave.\n\n4) CARE pays less than most other NGOs. I don't mind because my position is perfect for me, but it means we can't recruit highly qualified staff in country. The quality of work from most countries I've supported has been very poor compared to other NGOs where I've worked. This is partly a casualty of the decolonization effort. Staff in the Global North can never lead but may only support. Often that means a sacrifice in quality.\n\n5) Despite 2 years of visible backlash about the Communication team's unethical marketing and fundraising practices, they continue to depict suffering people in undignified and harmful ways to get donations. This has turned off some partners and donors we wanted to work with, particularly pop up ads asking for donations when, say, a donor comes to our site looking for information about our programs and approaches."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Disorganized, high turnover, poor communication", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Executive Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary is great High profile organization doing good work globally Highly skilled teams and powerhouse individuals working there", "cons": "Terrible communication Extremely high pressure and no culture of supporting staff No onboarding plan Most staff I met had worked for less than 18 months at Care - turnover is high because it is not a great place to work"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great company, great mission", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Global Events Intern in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great people, good work/life balance, lots of diversity, chances to move upward", "cons": "nonprofit work is hard but satisfying when it works out"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Retaliatory environment, duplicative U.S. leadership roles, wasteful organization", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The mission attracts hard-working, skilled experts committed to the values CARE exhibits, along with the star-studded external conferences and other awareness-raising events.
