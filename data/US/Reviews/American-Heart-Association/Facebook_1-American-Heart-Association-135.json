That is determined by the market you are in and NOT any true donor pipeline for your program. No Local Impact The organization claims to be all about mission and community, however, there is no local impact. You are guided to use deceptive donor practices by encouraging the use of phrases like \u201cyour money may go to this\u201d or \u201ccould be used for this\u201d when in most cases, a very low % of donor money actually goes to what the donor thinks they are funding.

It is nearly impossible to create a team mentality when you see your fellow staff once every few months. \r\n\r\nI have been with the organization long enough to see a lot of turnover. If you do not go from zero, ie no community connections or no strong established working relationships, to 100% in a very short amount of time, the organization will give you a plan. This plan typically entails a certain time frame (often unrealistic) to hit very aggressive goals such as all previous sponsors renewed, all leadership positions filled and event hitting goal. This plan is often very difficult to obtain and thus they are \"justified\" in terminating you. \r\n\r\nIn two and a half years I have had three different direct supervisors (VP level) and two different SVPs. My role was vacant for one year and the volunteers left with a manager who lives hours away to somewhat lead the event. I say lead loosely. I believe that structurally there is something wrong with the leadership of the organization when there is such significant turnover. Staff is only given a raise when they have not only hit a certain dollar goal but also gained a certain score on their yearly evaluation. One co worker was fired despite being the only team member hitting fiscal goal just three months before. \r\n\r\nI do believe there is a culture of bullying and often it is done by females due to the ratio of female leadership to male.
