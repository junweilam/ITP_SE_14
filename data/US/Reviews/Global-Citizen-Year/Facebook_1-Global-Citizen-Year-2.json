There is an apparent disconnect between HQ and country teams, and there are many inconsistencies regarding the organization's policies, procedures, and protocol. Management seems to make off the cuff decisions and are not present or accountable to their teams or fellows. Management is not willing to listen to or appreciate the opinions of team members, and seems to feel threatened when an employee is too opinionated or offers suggestions/alternatives.  \r\nEmployees are not encouraged to take advantage of benefits (health care, stipends) so you will have to put pressure on the organization to receive them. Management is constantly looking for ways to cut program costs, and do so at the expense and to the frustration of the employees and Fellows. The passion for the mission and the organization's principles is non-existent at the country level.\r\n\r\nA Team Leader is on call basically 24/7 for fellow's needs. TLs often work on the weekends (you're allowed the following workday off) however this, in addition to holidays are often overlooked, so you can feel like you're constantly working, and it can be difficult in the environment to claim these rights/speak up about it.\r\n\r\nA major inconsistency across countries is the lack of organization with regards to Health and Safety. Some countries have Health and Safety Managers, others don't. TLs are provided basic first aid training, but are often expected to take on the entire role of Health and Safety Manager without proper training, including emergency response and mental health issues. This is extremely concerning as TLs are not properly trained to handle these situations, let alone have the capacity to do both roles. Long days sitting at a clinic is a regular routine as a TL, which is tedious and can make you feel unproductive and stagnant. \r\n\r\nThere is very little room for growth in the Team Leader role and management lacks in helping to navigate the role and improve skills or provide advice when needed. You learn as you go, but it is up to you to figure things out and work on improving your skills (i.e. coaching/mentoring), with limited support. There is no career path for a TL or to move up in the company. If you're looking to \"grow your career path\" this is a dead end. \r\n\r\nTLs are extremely under-compensated, although the role is advertised to have a \"competitive local salary.\" The keyword here is local. If you are a national, this could be a good opportunity for you, however if you're an expat/foreigner, be prepared to be shocked by the below poverty line (US) annual salary, and don't expect to be able to do more than meet your basic needs each month (especially if you have student loan debt)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Highly recommended!
