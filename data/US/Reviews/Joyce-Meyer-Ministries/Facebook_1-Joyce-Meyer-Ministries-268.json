Dave and Joyce Meyer are great people, but they have delegated so much of this organization to their sons and others, that they don't have a clue what is taking place here most of the time on a day to day basis. They NEVER walk through any of the departments. They get their information from the same people, never looking at both sides of an issue, which is dangerous for leaders to operate that way.\r\n\r\nThese people running the show are the C-level folks. The CEO, CMO, CIO, COO and the people who answer to them--Division managers and Department managers. Lots of problems continuously because of these same people holding these positions for years. Nothing changes. No matter what they do, cronyism enables them to keep their jobs. \r\n\r\nThe CEO of Domestic is embarrassing. He spends the majority of his time on the ski slopes. Completely out of touch. Hardly see him. He depends on his cronies to handle everything.\r\n\r\nThese cronies are friends of his he has placed in managerial positions. They are sworn \"protectors of the Meyer family\" and will do whatever it takes to protect their own cushy jobs. \r\n\r\nThis pampered and territorial group of managers will throw you under the bus quicker than you can say \"Matthew 18 principle.\" What's sickening is many of them are very self righteous and use the Bible out of context to justify in their minds that the way they treat people is somehow okay. \r\n\r\nHere is something they are either clueless about or have such hard hearts that they don't care--There is a growing number of people over the years who have been employed at Joyce Meyer Ministries that have left with a bad taste in their mouths. This is not good PR, people. Those employees talk to their family and friends. Management seems oblivious to this. Or uncaring.\r\n\r\nSome folks who have worked their for years have learned to somehow live with this work environment.  \r\n\r\nThere is one CEO who does work hard, and that's David L. Meyer, who runs the Hand of Hope outreaches. \r\n\r\nThe HR department has a great staff, but they do not have the same authority that most corporations give to their HR department.  The department is mostly impotent and ceremonial. This is another reason how C levels and Managers do whatever the want without consequences. \r\n\r\nC Levels and Managers also are pretty clueless to the legalities that their behavior can bring down on their organization. Some day, someone is going to sue them personally, along with the ministry. Or maybe just them personally. The ministry is good at using guilt of \"don't sue your brother\" to get by with stuff. This will one day bite them. \r\n\r\nJMM is facing a huge crossroads in the future. Dave and Joyce are getting up in years. As of this review, Dave is 71 and Joyce is 69 years old. The plan is to transform the teaching ministry of Joyce Meyer Ministries into a completely focused humanitarian organization called Hand of Hope. Drastic changes will need to be made for it to continue after Dave and Joyce are gone. \r\n\r\nAs another reviewer said, the work environment is definitely a \"political quagmire.\""}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good people, poor leadership.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Jul 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you have a desire to work in Christian ministry, it is unlikely to find a better working environment that also gives you free weekends, and functions as a typical corporate 9-5 job.  The pay is decent, the insurance benefits are excellent as they pay 100% family coverage.  My experience had a good work-life balance.  The facilities are immaculately maintained, and various departments have their own ability to creatively apply features that make them unique. There are some really good people who work there, talented, caring, kind and normal.  They do a lot of good around the world especially with their humanitarian outreach.  The ministry owns everything they have because they don't believe in debt.  So it is a very liquid organization.  They own the multi-million dollar private jet, they own the building and everything in it, nothing is financed.  So they have a very sold business model in that sense.  The fact they stayed so liquid seemed to help them stay afloat during the recession. \r\n\r\nJoyce can be extremely generous and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nEven given all of the negative elements there is at least a sense that you are part of doing something good in the world rather than simply working at a company selling a product that is only about profits. \r\n\r\nAs long as you know what you are getting into and have resolved the issues in your heart that by working here you are selling and promoting Joyce Meyer, then I would recommend working at JMM, because every company has its issues, no company is perfect.", "cons": "JMM could be a much better place to work if they valued their people in a much greater way.\r\n\r\nThey do not value family time nor family integration as many forward thinking companies do.    \r\n\r\nThey don't compensate well for additional over time.  Example if you work an additional 40 hours during a busy season you will probably only receive one extra day of comp-time.  Although you are expected to work additional hours, you should not expect to be compensated for that.  So you spend time away from your friends, family and personal life, yet you are not reciprocated.  There are a lot of companies who do the same thing, but it seems even more out of place at a Christian ministry where family would normally be placed in high regard.    \r\n\r\nThe CEO is seldom seen, except when staff members pass around photos from Facebook of him snowboarding at the family place in Colorado.  The other brother is CEO of World Outreach and he actually DOES show up to work regularly.  However his personality is tyrannical given the number of times that I would be in the bathroom and someone from his department would come in crying after having been scolded by him.\r\n\r\nJMM is built on nepotism and cronyism.  You need to know who everyone is and how they are related to the family so that you don't accidentally offend the wrong person.  You may need to also carefully learn who the cronies are.  They are the people who will swiftly throw you under the bus to keep their status or prevent themselves getting in trouble.     \r\n\r\nThe system for giving raises when I was there was predictable.  You meet with your manager and they go over a list of things that add up to a certain number of points.  These points determine what raise you qualify for.  In all cases the deck is stacked against you because essentially they are looking for reasons to grade you low, so that they don't have to give you as much of a raise if any at all.  You can do 100 things right, but if based on their opinion you did one thing wrong, it counts against you.  The wrong thing is what is remembered on your review.  The 100 things right that you did was simply you performing at the expected level.  In other words if you do everything RIGHT you will be marked as performing as expected.  Even if you went above and beyond what actually would be required to accomplish those things, it is not counted as performing above expectations.  So it has generated a culture that applauds the status-quo.  Or an idea that you should work just hard enough not to get fired.  Don't stick your neck out, don't try anything new, just stay steady and build those proverbial Joyce widgets.     \r\n\r\nThere are many talented wonderful people stuck here because of the great insurance benefits but if they had a way out many of their best employees would be gone.  It doesn't have to be that way.  A cultural shift in the way they treat employees could make JMM a fantastic place to work.

I know that there will be no funny business going on as everyone is watched more than the NSA watches the American public.", "cons": "So the Cons.\r\n\r\nThere is a severe form of classicism that goes on here that made it extremely difficult to work. In most places it has always been pushed as best tool for the job, best people for the job. This is not the case here. Employee classicism is strong here. There isn't a form of team across the board. When it comes to equipment management gets the best equipment and the ability to have a flexible work schedule. The working class does not get this. Getting hardware that makes it easy to do the job is held back because it wouldn't look right. Now it might sound petty, and you are right it is. But it means a lot when the people doing the work get what they need. If it is a cost reason for this not occurring that's one thing. But that is not the case here.\r\n\r\nManagement, while many of the managers are very good at JMM. There are a few that make it extremely difficult to work. As alluded to in other reviews the PMO department was difficult. In many meetings things would feel combative. Even when ideas are being presented to do things differently it always felt like a fight. Over time this caused a lot of poor decisions to be made as people didn't have the energy to support their idea anymore. \r\n\r\nTrust: the lack of trust in employees to make appropriate decisions is another major con. The lack of trust or confidence in employee decision making makes it extremely frustrating to work here. There have been many nights where I went home wondering why I even bother. Been tasked with many highly visible projects and at the end of the day was forced to go with a way that would not be successful. When the project failed or stalled, I would then be the recipient of the blame. So i guess in a sense the employees are trusted to receive the blame for failure. \r\n\r\nAbsentee CEO:  This one is really odd. The CEO of the ministry is highly invisible which doesn't seem to fit for an organization of this size. It gives a feel of not caring. This might be reality as with the amount of turn-over and failed projects, there aren't a lot of macro changes nor is there a lot of communication received down stream from the CEO,\r\n\r\nBenefits: While many speak highly of the healthcare benefits, the rest are really rotten. There is no consistency with how simple things like PTO are to be managed. Many departments require that all salaried individuals take PTO for any Doctor's appointments. This is especially odd when there is mandatory overtime put in effect sometimes to complete projects. There is rarely grace given for employees when it does not work out in the ministry's favor. So yes, while you may have healthcare benefits, in a lot times you can't use it since you might not have the PTO for it or you are on a project which since it was poorly managed no longer has the time for you to take care of yourself.\r\n\r\nI'll also mention HR in that while the people are great, they are handcuffed to make changes it appears. All the posts I've seen here reviewing JMM are not exaggerations as I've witnessed the behaviors first hand."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "This will most likely be ignored.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a lot of great things about working at JMM. The people are exceptional, the mission is on point and the environment is certainly one of a kind. The benefits are nice, but with the rumors floating around that employees will have to pay for healthcare out of pocket, management should expect a mass exodus. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of great people that work at JMM including middle management in the IT department. Although IT takes a lot of flak on this site, I can say that the current middle management team is not to blame. I'd also like to say that the CSO and Director of Operations are both really stand up individuals.", "cons": "While there are a ton of PROS, the CONS are plentiful as well. VERY low pay, especially when compared to the Saint Louis region. The ministry labels themselves as a Media Ministry until it comes to pay, in which case they label themselves as a Humanitarian ministry. Sorry guys, you are NOT Salvation Army or Goodwill. You cannot pay good employees as though you are, and expect to keep exceptional talent. \r\n\r\nEven bigger than that, I witnessed sexual harassment within this building, reported it, and nothing was done to the individual. Perception around the office is that everything was swept under the rug by the puppets known as HR. You shouldn't have someone like this as an employee, let alone in front of Joyce Meyer constituents on a daily, monthly, annual basis. There have been MANY complaints about this individual, but it seems HR does not care to handle the situation. What used to be a ZERO tolerance policy has since changed to a MANAGERS DISCRETION. Sorry, but sexual harassment should not be up to the discretion of ANYONE. It should be an immediate termination. \r\n\r\nIf you ever have to deal with Project Management, prepare for one of the most arrogant, rude, micromanagers that you could ever imagine. If she doesn't get her way, everyone under her will be living a \"Hell on Earth\". The management over PM has no trust in any of the project managers. If you don't trust them, fire them; but if you DO trust them, allow them to do their job without interfering on a daily basis. Whenever a large project comes up, management will take the lead on it. If that project begins to fail, it will passed off at the last minute and FULL blame is placed on the project managers. However, if the PMs do something well, management will take full credit for that. C-Level management sees these issues, and rather than fixing the problem (i.e. FIRING THE ISSUE), they continue to coddle it. \r\n\r\nI always got along with the my C-Level Manager on a personal level. I have a ton of respect for him personally. But professionally, it was very hard to respect him. He made MANY promises over my time there, and never followed through. I was told, \"You have management potential, and I would like to mentor you, but you are still too new here for the management opening,\" and then he went on to hire external candidates for management positions. If you want to be a manager in IT, you should make sure to apply to it externally. Do NOT expect to be hired from within. \r\n\r\nAnother issue with the the leadership in IT was the lack of decision making. People often blamed IT issues on a former leader in the IT department, but when she was the a part of IT, she actually made decisions. Whether people agreed with those decisions all of the time or not, at least a decision was made. At least we could move forward. Ever since she was promoted, IT has been STALE. It has fallen to depths that previous employees probably wouldn't dream possible. \r\n\r\nIT middle management are rockstars, but the problem is they care about their employees too much. They actually want to see their employees succeed, which is a problem because the their leadership seems to have a different agenda. Because the SD and TI manager put their necks on the line for employees, they are constantly blamed for things they have no control of. When I started at JMM in 2013, there were 40 people in the IT department. When I left in 2015, there were 20, yet middle management was expected to churn out the same, if not more, amount of work, and if they didn't, they were chewed out. \r\n\r\nWhen Joyce decides that she is ready to retire and spend time with her husband (HIGHLY deserved, she is a fantastic speaker, preacher and woman), this ministry will FOLD.

Until then, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.", "cons": "Where do I start?  From the week I started I knew some people were going to be trouble to work with.  I assumed it was just an abrasive personality or maybe a bad week.  When I still felt that way a year in, I knew something systemic was wrong.  My direct manager was treated like an unwanted step child.  Until he was ultimately removed from duty, he was constantly berated and undermined.  Once a new manager was promoted from within, things went from bad to terrible at light speed.  The terminations started shortly thereafter for what I'd consider ridiculous or even in some cases, illegal reasons.  Unfortunately, the details aren't going to get typed here for fear of retribution.  \r\nIf they weren't just firing you, they were colluding behind your back to get you to quit by talking down to you, purposely twisting conversations and facts, or plotting scenarios to trap people in as well as straight up lying about facts.  They would create issues that didn't exist like walking with a coworker meant you were talking about management negatively.  Or going to lunch with the wrong people only to come back and be literally yelled at behind closed doors.  Constantly being bullied with passive aggressive threats and having \"Matthew 18\" rammed down your throat all the while letting middle to upper management absolutely off any hooks under the guise of \"business operations\".  \r\nAfter you figured out how to navigate those treacherous waters, you started to realize your reputation was being created/damaged without your involvement.  People (who were always unnamed) would \"say things\".  You never heard what they said or who said it (even though that was literally against their Matt 8:19 rule).  \r\nWhen you were on a project you were typically dictated to as to the technology, requirements, etc. but it was always communicated in a vague and generic way.  At first you thought maybe they were giving you some latitude to be creative.  WRONG!  They did it so they always had an escape route and of course, some underling to smoke with a bus.\r\nSenior management in IT would conduct witch hunt after witch hunt.  The management in project management was just as bad if not worse.  How can you possibly keep your job as a manager/director when you literally have people QUIT THEIR FIRST DAY!?  Sure, a few bad hires here and there, but the sheer volume of turnover was indicative that the management was either incompetent at hiring or managing.  Either way, that's grounds for removal.  Management would routinely run a project into the ground, blame the PM on the project then take it over themselves.  Once the project started going poorly again, they\u2019d blame team leads.  For example, the project to rebuild the ministry\u2019s public website had at least 3 team leads in one year.  They were either demoted or fired.  We saw a lot of really seasoned, technically expert employees come and go battered and bruised.  To this day, I maintain contact with numerous ex-JMM employees and we all tell war stories about this and that.  Ultimately, we\u2019re all better for having left. \r\nI wish the problems stopped in the IT department but, sadly, no, they don\u2019t.  The Media division is headed by management that spends a lot of their time travelling and on TV.  That in and of itself isn\u2019t bad, but who runs the place while they're gone?  That\u2019d be the marketing department.  They'd spend way too much time arguing with designers and developers over ridiculous things like how many pixels away a button should be, or the exact color of some text.  At the end of the day, good management will provide a clear vision and get out of the way and let the people they hire do the job their experts at.  When you would get management to finally discuss even the simplest designs, it\u2019d take weeks if not months to decide and be redesigned over and over.  I'm certain the significant time off, ski trips, and \"work travel\" were huge contributing factors there.  All the while, the clock is ticking down on the deadline because, \u201cit\u2019s already in print and on the TV show\u201d.  If I had a dollar for every time I heard that\u2026.  There were numerous project we ended up working 2-3 days non-stop to deploy.  This happened about once every 2-3 months.  Working from 8a-10p was regular for some weeks.  Oh, and since we were salaried\u2026 no pay.  Comp time??? PTO??? Rarely happened unless my direct manager just did it himself.  We worked tirelessly to build the new website and get it deployed even though all the technology staff advised numerous times that it was a sinking ship and it\u2019d be better to cut the losses and rebuild it correctly.  Those conversations took place well over 5 years ago and still\u2026 to this day, after spending MILLIONS of donation dollars, the site has yet to be finished.  Even after some of us worked 100h weeks for months on end to deploy the broken new site, we got a few days of PTO and a 5% bonus (taxed at 40%).\r\nI can tell you first hand, being negative about ANYTHING (including recommending against a design or technology) is essentially hanging yourself.  Even if you\u2019re right about the suggestion and they don\u2019t agree\u2026 it\u2019s your fault and surely you will take the fall.\r\nAt some point, the board of directors and/or donors need to step up and see just how much money gets wasted on poor management like this.  From millions of dollars for a busted CRM to more millions on a busted website to millions on employee turnover\u2026 at some point, they\u2019ll have to realize the issues and correct them.  Maybe if they created a department that oversaw resources\u2026 you know the human resources that work there rather than just the department that hires and fires people JMM would ACTUALLY be one of the \u201cBest places to work in St. Louis\u201d."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "What exit interviews are...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They gave me the tools to get a better job!", "cons": "I just wanted it know that an \"exit interview\" consisted of being taken to top floor, sat down with a woman I've never met nor knew my department, and being asked if I had siblings and my favorite part of working there.

Also Roby Walker was also kind and caring. The day I was let go Roby said he was so sorry and gave me a hug and acted like he really cared. The manager basically gave me a box and told me to get my stuff, go home or to HR. Thanks for your almost twenty years of service now get out.", "cons": "Some of the rules and regulations were draconian. Management would intimidate workers with veiled threats of job cuts. If you had a medical issue the management would treat you badly and try to remove you or get you to quit by making you miserable. Everything is about quotas. If you made it you were good but if not you were always looking over your back wonder if you would be laid off. Once you had a disability the manager would be on a personal mission to get rid of you even though you have faithfully served and worked for the ministry for nearly two decades. The CEO never visited our dept or greeted the employees. The ministry did not abide by the rules of the disabilities act in reference to a special accomodation.  You would never be allowed to question anything that a supervisor did or said and suggestions would not be considered. I made a suggestion that changed and helped the way our dept. ran. I made it a few years before it was implemented and nothing was said at the time and then later they put my plan into practice and acted like they came up with the idea and I never received any credit for the idea that has helped them do their job easier to this day. Also any moves into a different position were considered lateral moves. There was such an oppressive feel to the place and stress on the employees to make quotas that some would regularly work off the clock to try and get quotas met. We were always told that no one has ever been in trouble or lost a job because not making quotas but i was let go after almost 20 years. The only thing that mattered was quotas nothing else about your almost 20 years of service. We would have mandatory overtime and sometimes you would find out on a thursday that you had to work on saturday or else. Unless you had a life or death situation you had to be there, even though you may have made plans with family or friends months ago. The ministrys needs always had to come first. I was personally the victim of bullying by a fellow co worker for nearly 20 years and when I tried to do something about it I was made to feel like it was my fault probably because this person was part of the travel team and could do no wrong but I still have had to deal with the psychological abuse that this person heaped on me for years. When I knew that i would not be there much longer because of the personal mission of the manager to get rid of me I requested a meeting with Dan Meyer but was not allowed to see him."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Christian organization or religious organization?", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice coworkers, beautiful building, knowing that your job positively impacts those who are in need.", "cons": "Difficult to advance your career.

These people are all non-management employees. \r\n\r\nThe Healthcare -- 100% coverage for me, (They do not cover spouses who work -- even though they tried to claim otherwise in the benefits review), and my children. \r\n\r\nThe Security -- As a previous reviewer mentioned, the security team is to die for. \r\n\r\nSD Manager -- This guy is fantastic. He cares. Unfortunately, I believe that will be his downfall. He cares too much. I've not met the new manager, but I've heard really solid things about him too. Great middle management in IT.", "cons": "The CEO -- In my entire time at JMM, I believe that I actually saw the CEO a whopping total of 1 time. He didn't introduce himself by any means, because he doesn't have time to meet the peasants that allow him to ski 9 months out of the year. All decision making had to come from the CEO, so nothing ever got accomplished here because he was never around. \r\n\r\nThe CIO -- Everyone is terrified of this man. I do not get it. Worst decision maker that I have ever worked for. (I would have liked to say \"work with\", but you can't work with this guy. You are ALWAYS wrong.) He is a liar, he is a manipulator, and God forbid you turn your back for even a moment... He will stab you in the back faster than you can say Matthew 18. This is a man that would not cut it as a Mid-Level Manager in any other company. Especially in St. Louis, people know who he is. Recruiters have actually called me and said, \u201cWe can get you out from under the thumb of [Name]\u201d. Everyone knows who he is, and everyone knows what he is. Do not even attempt to correct him on anything. Do not attempt to present an idea that goes against his. Do not attempt to cross him. You will be eaten alive. \r\n\r\nProject Management\u2013 The only way to get anything through the dictatorship over this team is to use the back door. Nothing gets done correctly, everything is rushed, and if it\u2019s not done right, it\u2019s your fault. The worst part is that everyone knows it. People outside of IT have claimed that project management treats everyone like children. We are always talked down to in meetings. We are always made to look like the bad guy in front of customers. MULTIPLE people have quit within a week of working with this group. The turnover in IT/PMO is at least 10 times the amount of any other department at the ministry. That in and of itself should be a warning. \r\n\r\nHR -- As other reviewers have mentioned, HR is full of great people, but they are really just a smokescreen for the COO. It's unfortunate because the COO is scared of the CIO. Joyce Meyer has written something like 70+ books... She could write at least double that with the complaints that have been submitted to HR and ignored. The COO will not act on the complaints, because he has no spine. The most unfortunate part is that people really do like everyone in HR. The employees are all top notch people. They will lie to you, and they will manipulate situations, but that is definitely coming from above. I do not believe that the HR employees purposefully manipulate people.\r\n\r\n The Website \u2013 If donors only knew how many millions of dollars have been spent trying to build a new website they would immediately stop donating. JMM always preaches about how they are open with their finances, and they release the annual financial report every year, but that report does not tell the whole story. Not even close.  The CEO either doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t care, how horrible this project has been. It\u2019s taken over 5 years of development, multiple project managers, multiple team leads, multiple Web Management changes, multiple vendor changes, and it is still not complete. The only consistency on this project has been the CIO who makes bad decisions and the Project Management Office which dictates everything. Maybe it\u2019s time to move on from these people and you can finally have the website that integrates with Facebook. \r\n\r\nOne more HR con -- Sweeping things under the rug. I have read every single review on this site. Every single one. The responses \"The Executive Team will review this\" or \"Looks like you had an abnormal experience\" are absurd. If you got every single member of IT (and most employees outside of IT who have to deal with PMO or IT) in a one on one situation with the COO or CEO, each one will tell you the same story. This is not just a couple of disgruntled employees looking to bash the ministry. I love what Joyce Meyer MInistries stands for. I love the work that Joyce does. I love the people that I worked with. I am not just a disgruntled employee. I want to see the ministry succeed. The only way to do that is to fire the problem. There will be no success until those situations are cleared up."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Dec 2015", "job_title": " in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Excellent benefits package\r\n- Great work environment\r\n- Great work-life balance\r\n- Good Job Security\r\n- Cohesive and excited management team\r\n- Genuine care for employees", "cons": "- Little room for advancement within the organization"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Wonderful place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "29 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fenton, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love my job.
