Salaries were bench marked which has led to lower salaries for APM, PM, and Sr PM employees than they were previously (despite increased cost of living across the board ...makes sense) and HR/ Compensation rarely responds to equity reviews unless it is for high level staff members who already make market level salaries to have an increase. They also are not flexible at adjusting salaries for employees who have been in a similar position for years, have years more experience than external candidates coming in (and may have an MA vs. a BA), or just in general rewarding people for being a team player and even with support from outside of HR you are still told, no. HR then talks about issues of retention and wanting to take it seriously. Make it make sense, please! Now that the workforce has gone remote and people can choose to live remotely in Iowa I guess you can get away with paying people so little. Preach DEI as of late without realizing that things like low pay in DC, lack of clear promotion process or consistent, standard merit increases (I guess they are trying to fix this), or benefits that help people with loan forgiveness directly impacts who can apply and take a position with little room for growth or a decent salary. You really do not need a Masters Degree to figure out why diverse applicants or filling positions with diverse people can be difficult. Most of the opportunities are contingent on your supervisor supporting you or your team. Some teams do not offer this support at all and do not train or onboard employees. Some managers do deserve to be at the level they are at because they work hard and know their stuff, but are TERRIBLE managers, and they should not be managing people below them unless they are coming in with experience and are ready to hit the ground running.  All the standardization for onboarding people has been taken on by junior level employees who did so without getting paid to help the org.

This combination means that PSI runs very effective programs that achieve real change, and they do it mostly without the paternalistic overtones seen at many other NGOs.  The second is that PSI truly values innovation and evidence.  This again comes through in some of its best international work, but is also true in the day to day office environment.

This manifests in PSI's day to day culture as well.  It can be difficult for junior staff to get responses to emails from more senior staff, senior staff are often late or don't show up to meetings held by junior staff, initiatives started by junior staff are marginalized, and senior staff talk over or throw out the meeting plans of more junior staff.  Add to this that there are very few defined career paths at PSI, it can be hard for junior staff to find mentors and advocates, and there is a prevailing sense that one has to leave PSI and come back in order to advance on the totem pole.  It is no secret that no one works at PSI for the money alone, so it should come as no surprise that time and time again talented and passionate junior staff who love PSI and the work we do hit a wall, realize they deserve better than what they are getting at PSI, and leave.

In the same year, World Vision, whose annual operating budget is $400m greater than PSI\u2019s, paid theirs $272k.  FHI360 with a similar operating budget to PSI, $315k.  Organizations with smaller budgets but similar reputation: PATH $285k; Plan International $180k; Marie Stopes International $300k. \r\n\r\n(Interestingly, PSI\u2019s CEO is an exception and is paid less than the industry average. And it must be noted that many of the senior positions are held by career-PSI staff whose salaries reflect over a decade of commitment to the organization.)\r\n\r\nThe top-heavy stature of PSI is particularly demoralizing given the performance of some of those best paid; Global Marketing is led with intimidation and suppression, Corporate Partnerships and Philanthropy with elitism, superficiality and discrimination.\r\n\r\nEmployer contribution towards retirement is generous, however the plan takes 5 years of employment before being fully vested; this makes it far less accessible to junior staff who have less stability and are more likely to require higher education. Seeking retention makes sense, but a 5-year policy highly favors senior level staff whose positions are typically longer term and for whom PSI contributes a far greater amount.\r\n\r\nWhile PSI understandably needs to compensate well to attract top performers, PSI\u2019s competitiveness shouldn\u2019t be limited to the upper ranks of the organization.

At first it was refreshing to see the CEO talking openly about these issues but years later I am just tired. Once leadership collected feedback but in the meeting to discuss the results we were told that none of the reasons we cited were accurate\u2014we were not upset because of pay, burnout, toxic work culture\u2014but because of office renovations. The conversation ended there. \r\n\r\nWhen employees expressed anxiety over job security (low cash problems due to COVID/bad management). Leadership\u2019s response was to cut the conversation short saying we \u2018should be adults\u2019 when talking about these uncertainties. The message was clear \u2018don\u2019t complain if you are afraid of losing your job because that would make you look immature.\u2019 Meanwhile rightsizing is coming. \r\n\r\nBad management is rampant (and top heavy). There are managers that belittle, ignore, even yell at their staff. Others dump all the actual work on their staff with no guidance or support. Their names are known but if anyone asks that is not a trusted confidant you better not say anything for fear of retaliation. PSI has a non-retaliation policy that is a farse (see other glassdoor reviews of people who went to HR to with legitimate complaints of harassment only to be put on a performance improvement plan and let go). Given that HR is just as bad or worse at simultaneously doing nothing and being mean about it, it is not a surprise nothing is being done. \r\n\r\nReminders of how lucky you are because \u2018hundreds of people applied for your job and you were chosen\u2019 with the unspoken and \u2018hundreds more will apply when you are gone\u2019 just to let you know that if you are upset about working conditions you can easily be replaced. Junior staff created a committee to bring complaints of harassment, bullying and low pay to leadership (notice they bypassed HR). The response was \u2018PSI pays the market rate\u2019 as if underpaying employees is acceptable because other organizations also do the same. The harassment was not addressed. The toxic work environment is so bad that people have exchanged stories about where the best place to cry is so often that it is common knowledge even if you do not need to.\r\n\r\nTurnover has been high which makes an organization already difficult to navigate even harder. There are no systems, no accountability, feeble attempts at keeping records and an attitude of \u2018that\u2019s not my job\u2019 that permeates way too many interactions. \r\n\r\nThere is a paralysis in decision making. It is literally no one\u2019s job to make a decision. Because almost all work is done by lower level employees who do not have decision making authority, they find themselves running around like chickens with their heads cut off until even minor issues are escalated to the Vice President level (that isn\u2019t too impressive, we have at least 10 of them now) where people who really shouldn\u2019t be weighing in on the day-to-day have to get involved. People say \u2018good luck\u2019 when you tell them you are going to X person\u2019s office because they have had to pull teeth to get X person to do their basic job functions. \r\n\r\nRacism from DC staff towards field staff is well known (see other glassdoor reviews). Expats (white, mostly Americans) who live in the countries we work yell at staff, make unfair demands to their time and say racist things. \u201cThese people cannot learn,\u201d \u201cthese people are lazy,\u201d \u201cthey will never understand,\u201d \u201cyou have to hold their hands to get anything done.\u201d Worth noting, many of these same people cannot be bothered to have a working knowledge of the 2nd (sometimes 3rd, 4th or 5th) language that local staff uses in the office. They cannot do basic daily tasks in the country they live in such as go to the market or catch a taxi on their own. If you are not sure why someone would move to a country where they do not like the people it's probably because they make 90k+ a year (with many making much more than 100k a year), plus 40% of their salary in cash benefits (that\u2019s tax free), their kids tuition to exorbitantly expensive private schools are paid for, they get to go home 2 times a year on company/project funds, etc. In these countries drivers usually make around $500/month in salary and every expense report they submit is closely scrutinized because god forbid the guy making $6,000/year get an extra $20 in per diem (\u201cthose people are always out to take advantage of the system\u201d). \r\n\r\nThe positive reviews on glassdoor look like higher level staff (the one scolding people for leaving bad reviews was funny). They are generally happy because they make more money and are shielded from the worst of the office politics. Not surprisingly they often stay longer.\r\n\r\nBefore you accept a position at PSI, read more of the reviews and really consider where you are in your career.

Much higher than similar organizations, because most people don't like been treated poorly and held to unrealistic, even impossible expectations when they do the vast majority of the actual work at the organization.  This was particularly pronounced on my team, where the leadership repeatedly talked about how we were 'paying our dues,' which I generally didn't agree with, but was worse because many of the members of my team had 5-10 years of relevant experience that was completely ignored/under-utilized.  \r\n\r\nSalaries of mid and entry level staff lag behind comparable organizations in the industry, with specific teams requiring the same experience level for much lower pay (the same teams that develop and manage budgets and, therefore, know how underpaid they are).\r\n\r\nThere is a general trend where many leaders have been at the organization so long (typically between 10-20 years) that they are basically given free reign.  There is very little standardization between teams, and many leaders who are notorious bullies (as was the leader of my team), and never seem to face consequences.  This often means that they held your position many years ago, and have an outdated understanding and expectations of what it takes to complete the work, because both the industry and the organization have changed so much. The organization has grown rapidly and systems have lagged behind, meaning staff spends most of their time dealing with broken systems instead of actually contributing meaningfully to programs.\r\n\r\nI tried to raise many of these issues to my supervisor, who would pretty much roll her eyes and ignore me.

One was with one of my former team members who quit soon after I started, who had been with the organization for quite a while relative to other staff.

She said she felt like she had been lied about how great PSI was by people who recommended the position to her.  I had felt the same way, and I think it has something to do with the fact that they offer staff a $1000 bonus for recommending new employees - which, especially given that employees are not very well paid, would indeed incentivize staff to make the picture rosier than it is in reality.\r\n\r\nNow I do know that there was some variation, with the leaders of a few teams being known for their interest in supporting the growth of the professionals on their team, but the general sense was that this was a rather unique situation."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Needs an Overhaul", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Impactful programs and global presence", "cons": "Favoritism, racism, and aloof executives management.

Then their teams send passive aggressive or just plain INSULTING emails to PMTs and country staff, call us incompetent behind our backs and chastise our in-country staff for not understanding their kindergarten level, google translate French and Spanish. Or they get upset when no one in-country wants to participate in their silly extracurricular \u201cinitiatives\u201d and \u201cchallenges\u201d they do to keep themselves busy because they dump all the REAL work on the PMTs. PMTs get no contact with the donor but we\u2019re chastised when our funding gets cut or bids don\u2019t get won but the teams who actually work directly with the donor are consoled by their directors when they can\u2019t even perform simple stakeholder engagement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7      Management is so bad it\u2019s scary. Managers are evaluated without input from their supervisees. 50% of your job is to supervise someone and yet that person isn\u2019t included in evaluations \u2013 ridiculous. How does that contribute to building capacity? How does that support any staff?  Just because someone has the title of manager it does not mean that they are a good manager. We just started a year-long program called \u201cGreat Manager\u2019s Training\u201d that is completely useless. It takes a year to figure out that you shouldn't bully your staff? Sr level managers (several who have already taken this training) berate and scream at their staff and give opportunities to only the people who kiss up to them or ignore the abuse. Newly minted managers treat their interns and program assistants like their house-keepers/personal secretaries and as a manager myself it\u2019s so sad to watch. If your manager wants you out, they will find a way to put you on a performance improvement plan (PIP)\u2014which heads up is PSI\u2019s way of kicking you out, but legally. (Looking at you WCA/Global Fund Unit! The fact that people can count how many people of color you\u2019ve bullied and pushed out of your department alone, you should be ashamed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Want a promotion? Get in line. If your manager doesn\u2019t like you, you\u2019re screwed. If your manager likes you but doesn\u2019t want to advocate for you. You\u2019re screwed. If your manager likes you, but no one likes your manager\u2026 You\u2019re screwed. Think it\u2019s a good idea to go to HR? Ha! Anything that involves HR is pure unfiltered trash. So yes ladies, gents, and non-binaries you\u2019re ... you guessed it \u2026 SCREWED.  There are also certain managers who don\u2019t want you to grow before they do, so they stifle your opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7      A number of senior level people are paid 100K+ to work remotely in low cost of living cities as we struggle to keep our head above water in DC with wages for people with masters starting at 40K. Interns to APMs are often running out of work by 4:45pm to make their next shift at some bar, restaurant, yoga studio, etc. But will be online at 10pm to continue working on things way above their pay grade. As a PM, I try to advocate for my junior staff but conversations with HR go nowhere. I've even had to help another staff find a higher paying job because they couldn't afford cost of living.\r\n\r\n\u00b7      PSI loves the word \u201cstrategy\u201d and does not understand what this entails. We have a new one every week. We spend months throwing buzz words and spend 1000s of dollars sending people abroad to roll out the new strategy of the month that no one understands. People that have no sense of cultural competency and yell at field staff or don't even know how to communicate with \"those people\" (as they say). They say that the countries are always behind, but HQ never involves them in anything, nothing is ever translated into their languages (especially our Portuguese staff) and instead of the 3 year roll out process at HQ, country staff get a 3 day workshop with a facilitator that has a 1st grade understanding of Spanish/French, an hour Skype for Business phone call where the first 59 minutes we're trying to connect, and an email that promises more information about the \"strategy\" that will never come. But the problem is definitely \"them\" being difficult not HQ, right? The xenophobia is striking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7      They have entire project teams serving Africa, Asia, and LAC with NO team members who are African, Asian, or Latinx. And when they do have them, they fly out the door after they realize what kind of place PSI is). As a POC, if you speak up or have an opinion you are considered aggressive. If a white person does it, it\u2019s more \u201cJane has so much initiative! What an asset to the team.\u201d If a POC questions anything or advocates for anything they are \u201ctoo direct\u201d, \u201cchildish\u201d, or \u201cemotional\u201d even. They even have to apologize to white staff for their white tears. But when a white person does it and is even seen among other staff as being rude or condescending, senior staff see it as \u201cAdam is a leader\u2026 haha he\u2019s so blunt and direct but that\u2019s just his nature!\u201d \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7      Work life balance does not exist and is looked down upon. Unless you\u2019re a director/VP because they\u2019re on vacation 6 months out of the year. Oops, I mean \u201cspeaking\u201d at a \u201cconference\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7      PSI rolled out a salary matrix almost 2 years ago and HR still can\u2019t explain it. They claim that they do equity reviews to ensure equality across gender and individual experience but they pick the lowest starting number for every position. (Except if you are male.) There is no negotiation\u2026unless you have a manager that is willing to fight for you, but as I mentioned before that is usually never the case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7      If you decide to work at PSI, after a couple months the initial excitement disappears because you realize there is no sense of knowledge management. You are basically starting from scratch. There is inadequate training, superficial introductory meetings and no follow up. All the turn over isn\u2019t helping either. Every week there is a ridiculously cringy email of someone thanking PSI for their time (read: burn out) and to please keep in touch (No thanks.)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Working for a great cause can be frustrating", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 May 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "PSI does incredible work, and it's exciting to be part of that.

It goes without saying that you are expected to put in long hours and those that don't are left behind.   You think you are working for a great cause and feel good about it.

I've seen this company burn out so many of my colleagues and PSI does nothing to help these people but show them the door.  There is big disparity in pay between employees.

At a geekier level, PSI also loves to measure its impact, almost obsessively.  Not all actors in the development sector have the same commitment to measuring impact.  Finally, PSI does truly believe in ownership; PSI is not just a contractor, going in and out of a country with a view to ticking the boxes and completing a contract.  Instead, PSI creates organizations and grows people in countries all around the world.  Sometimes successfully, sometimes less so, but always striving.", "cons": "For early to mid-career professionals, it can be hard to find their voice and their way in the PSI/Washington environment - but that says as much about the fast shifting landscape of development funding as it does PSI.  For example, a decade ago organizations like PSI were sending out many relatively 'early career' professionals to be Country Reps and senior staff all around the world.  But the world has changed e.g. more countries now have a cadre of their own professionals and don\u2019t need so many expats.  That is a good thing.  And while some people still thrive and find opportunities in PSI , the career pathway for many people in DC is not always an easy one to navigate, in PSI or anywhere.   \r\n\r\nAll I can say, and other opinions are available, is if you are good at what you do, and what is needed, and have commitment, chances are you will find a way to succeed in PSI (or anywhere!).  For all the people who have struggled to find a career pathway in PSI, I see many that have succeeded,  both from within the DC office and from within country teams.  I have seen many early career professionals find a route to country programs from DC, with recent examples seeing DC early career staff posted to Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Niger, Cambodia, to name but some.  If this pathway interests you, note that a highly valued skill for these inter-office transfers seems to increasingly be an understanding of data and digital technologies.   Finance skills are, of course always also a plus.  I have also seen many staff start in a country program, and then move onto much bigger international roles, with PSI or others.\r\n\r\nA second con, and this is really just to reflect on a couple of tough reviews that I saw below, is PSI struggled with their HR/People Department in 2016-17.  Some wobbles, some mistakes.  But there was not an institutional rot, just a tough year and a wake up  call.  2017 was a tough year for many people on many fronts.  I work still at PSI, so I am biased, but the organization has recruited some new people to that aspect of the business in 2018 and we all hope that part of the ship will right itself.   I certainly don't recognize in PSI the ubiquitous nefarious leadership that 1-2 reviewers commented on.  I suspect those 1-2 people had a bad experiences and that is sad, and not OK, but it's not the norm.  Leadership at PSI are a pretty kind bunch, who would, and do, have a meal or a drink with anyone. PSI is not especially hierarchical.  I can imagine there are 1-2 people or incidents that were not OK, and I know PSI has taken action in such cases.  But broadly speaking, PSI is an organization with honor and integrity.  Sometimes doing brilliant things.  Sometimes muddling through.  And occasionally making mistakes (but admitting them!)\r\n\r\nIf you are curious and passionate about health and development, you could do a lot worse than join PSI.  Your ideas will be listened to.

Higher ups witness it as well and pretend to not see anything, complaints are tossed out and you\u2019re made to feel like you\u2019re the issue.\r\nThere are departments (certain regional department - ask around there is one that is know as the problem child) where staff get fired, reprimanded or ridiculed for making the same errors that others in other departments have made countless times with no consequences. \r\nJunior staff are treated like dog doodoo on the sole of middle to upper management. You are underpaid but overworked and on top of that there is an instilled fear of losing your job They\u2019ll work you like a mule only to blame you for their errors and take ownership of your successes \r\nYour manager makes your career \u2013 you will have some managers (claps for Southern Africa and East Africa) who are so involved into your professional growth and make sure there is equity in opportunities awarded to all their supervisees. Then there are the mean managers (clap for yourselves, you know who you are) \u2013 If you have one of those, they will break you, make you feel worthless, undervalued and underappreciated, etc.  God forbid they\u2019re with the in crowd!\r\nBasic criteria for promotion or advancement is to agree with them blindly \u2013 How dare you have you own opinions on anything!\r\n Managers often time have not received training on how to be a great leader, they have zero knowledge of people management and are not required to learn\r\nSupervisee opinions on their supervisors are not asked, talk less of taken into consideration. In the 3 years I\u2019ve worked here, I have been asked just once about a supervisor\u2019s performance.

Case in point: junior staff complains about bullying manager, not long after, HR calls meeting with staff and said manager about Manager\u2019s sudden complain about staff performance, staff gets reprimanded for poor performance, staff gets fired for poor performance. Staff if fired without once having a separate conversation to delve into bullying and manager never once gets a talk to about bullying. Manager is still employed by the way and situation is repeating.\r\nSomeone else mentioned the rampant toxic environment at PSI \u2013 I wholeheartedly agree. the only thing I disagree about is the it being most prevalent in Senior managers and director levels. This starts with managers, who play the blame game and are quick to throw their subordinates under the bus and/or encourage their subordinates to throw each other under the bus! This is even more so intense at the senior manager and director level.\r\nLots of turnover \u2013 every day a new person, new eager faces are introduced to you. It\u2019s sad to see how those eager faces change in the course of the year, if they last that long.\r\nUp until a couple of months ago, there wasn\u2019t an onboarding process! I know! Unbelievable but true! \r\nIt\u2019s a baptism by fire here meaning you\u2019re thrown into a burning building your first day and expected to come out victorious. There\u2019s actual shock when you fail at something you were never trained on! and you\u2019re given looks for asking things you\u2019re supposed to know but didn\u2019t.\r\nThe systems are totally out of date \u2013 like we\u2019re literally just now getting excited about SharePoint for example when others have been using it for years and have even moved on.\r\nPSI is king of reinventing themselves \u2013 same old outdated ideas covered up with shiny brand-new names and taglines. Also great at putting band aids to cover up infected wounds. \r\nRecently made changes to the names of regions we operate in, a whole overhaul of portfolios and such, as if that would solve the deeper issues staff deal with. It\u2019s the biggest waste of funds, the biggest joke between staff and the topic for water cooler conversations.\r\nFeedback on performance varies greatly depending on your department! There are different standards for performance for the same roles. Feedback isn\u2019t given in a constructive manner \u2013 if the goal is to help you grow and develop professionally, there should be an emphasis on this. But there isn\u2019t, as such it\u2019s hard to further your career goals or feel empowered \r\nIf you are interested in a technical position, try to get your foot in the door as such rather than getting in through a regional department. It\u2019s very hard to match the switch and you\u2019ll be stuck with admin work. It\u2019s common practice to have people with MPHs doing admin work. I personally know one who escaped West and Central Africa for a position with a core technical team. As they put it, it required herculean efforts and years of being unhappy and unfulfilled.\r\nSalaries for entry/mid level staff are not on part with similar organizations \u2013 it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t work for a non-profit to makes big bucks \u2013 not this is not the case for upper management and C-Suite.

Actually you won\u2019t because they all left, sorry! \r\n-\tRecently, PSI just made pretty much all the directors into Vice Presidents for no good reason. Yet the middle management and juniors are constantly overlooked and overworked. You have junior staff working 2-3 jobs and middle management fighting to negotiate for $2,000. Every quarter revenue is down, there was some crappy excuse for ppl NOT getting bonuses this year (which is barely a few hundred bucks), people paid at the minimum salary band, etc yet these new VPs are making top dollar & bringing in literally NO funding. Projects are closing up every month. You know who brings in funding? The technical advisors and middle management writing all the proposals, not the directors who throw a signature on it & call it a day. Projects closing left & right, departments merging bc they don\u2019t have enough funding to exist on their own, yet you needed new VPs?? Meanwhile we just got a new chief of HR after MONTHS. \r\n-\tYou can\u2019t do a review of your manager but they\u2019re required to do one for you. Which means if you have a great manager they don\u2019t get their praise but if you have a terrible one you basically have to sit there & deal with it. If you\u2019re going to report bullying make sure you have another job lined up or a body-camera on because HR does nothing about retaliation except tell you to leave if you don\u2019t like it. Higher ups will see it & turn a blind eye to \u201cnot get involved\u201d.\r\n-\tSpeaking of HR\u2026 HR is SPRINTING out the door & no one knows why.

Everyone keeps wondering when\u2019s the best time to jump ship because the turnover rate is out of control. Every week is 2-3 emails about people leaving & now it\u2019s to the point where people are leaving without a job lined up for their own sanity. \r\n-\tSupervisor to supervisee bullying is strong here & nothing gets done about it. HR will twiddle their thumbs, but if the bully/supervisor is close with their own manager then you might as well find a new job because either 1) nothing will change & you\u2019ll be more miserable & retaliated against or 2) you\u2019re \u201csuddenly\u201d placed on a performance improvement plan which is codeword for \u201cresign now or be fired\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen a person on a PIP who wasn\u2019t out the door within 2 weeks & it\u2019s always been because of manager ego.\r\n-\tThis organization is not a place for people of color. There\u2019s 2 or 3 tokens per department (except Franco department) and sometimes none in a whole team. It\u2019s terrible that 95% of HQ looks nothing like the countries/people they serve or their in-country staff. Those tokens do not get the same opportunities or pay, & once you get past junior/ midmanagement level, you barely see them. The micro-aggressions here are blatant. Black, Latinx & Asian employees get \u201cmistaken\u201d for themselves almost daily. Some HQ employees have even gone as far as to address in-country staff as \u201cthose kinds of people\u201d with apparent disdain & discomfort, yet have no problem posting 1000 white savior photos to social media about how they \u201ctaught the ppl of Asia/Africa\u201d. On phone calls you can hear expats berating & actually yelling at their staff but these staff members are unable to report due to fear of losing their jobs. \r\n-\tFor an organization that has offices in developing countries & regularly sends staff there, you\u2019d think they\u2019d at least have a training for race/diversity/culture relations but no. HQ staff & expats insult in-country staff to their faces & belittle them. The stupid \u201cethicspoint\u201d is useless. I myself have used it 4 times & nothing came of it. \r\n-\tWork-life balance is a myth. You can go on vacation but people will still email you every day as if you\u2019re still in the office & expect you to respond. We are paid NGO MONEY which is damn near equivalent to monopoly money so readjust your expectations. Or ask your new VPs to pull their weight.\r\n-\tYour professional growth is 100% dependent on 1 your manager, 2 if that person likes you & 3 where THEY want you to grow. Unless you have one of the good managers, you have to leave PSI to get to where you want to be. \r\n-\tInternal equity for salaries is one of the biggest lies this organization tells. If your boss isn\u2019t ready to fight HR round for round with you then too bad. If you\u2019re not super vocal & ready to raise hell, too bad. It's written in the comments of the culture survery too. They did a gender pay assessment and apparently women & men have equal pay here but what did you expect in an organization that is 98.6% women?!?! I\u2019ve heard my coworkers of color mention that they know they make less than others as well.\r\n- We did a random exercise where everyone anonymously wrote their feedback. Most people had the same issues I'm listing here and C-Suite basically told us all that we don't know what we're talking about\r\n- Turnover is high, morale is so low that new hires who have been here under 9 months are already applying elsewhere.\r\n-\tYour degree means nothing, use it at an organization that will value it. You have MAs & returned peace corp volunteers as interns & BAs as Sr. Program Managers making double the salary. \r\n-\tIf you\u2019re looking to come to PSI bc you want to go to the field then that\u2019s a BIG joke (I told you they write themselves). It will take years of brown nosing to even get a short term stint. What did you think this was, an actually international NGO? PSI in the intl dev space is a joke. We put out no real thought and are rarely at the table with other reputable NGOs. We also tell new hires that they'll have opportunities to go to the field but it's a lie to attract people.\r\n-\tPSI doesn\u2019t value its employees. Favoritism is their middle name if you aren\u2019t a favorite, you\u2019re getting nowhere. Every other review for the company for YEARS says this same thing. PSI doesn\u2019t value you if you stay, they value you when you leave. So many good people have left In just the past 3 months alone.\r\n-\tThe saddest part. I\u2019ve heard from friends at two other NGOs that our staff in the field sometimes refer to PSI as colonizers because of how the expats treat them. How disgraceful!\r\n- If you still decide to work here after reading all these reviews then you have no one to blame but yourself. You're honestly better off unemployed or bartending (you'd make more too)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Working hard for a good cause", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "PSI is an ambitious organisation improving the health of people all over the world.

The current HR culture is toxic and unfriendly with a talented but understaffed and under-resourced recruitment team struggling to backfill the exodus of staff and institutional knowledge while the remainder of HR seems entirely disinterested in retention or organizational goals. Interim HR leadership is unfriendly (at best) and has created a toxic environment that neither inspires trust nor invites even a visit. As a result, employees effectively have no place to go but out the door if they have issues or concerns around their employment. PSI\u2019s HR Business Partnering function has also dwindled in size and competency so employees are left to fend for themselves.

Most managers are merely technical people that have moved up the ladder out of need and are poorly equipped to manage.
