The Georgetown office looks like a war zone.\r\n\r\n- This organization preys on visa-seekers, temp workers, contractors, and recent graduates. If you are a visa-seeker or temp worker expect to be strung along for some time. Ask your recruiter for data about successful sponsorships or temp conversions to AIR employees.\r\n\r\n- On that note, compensation is not competitive if you don't manage people. Comp strategy is to pay an egregious salary to an \"experienced\" people manager and hope their knowledge trickles down to less experienced staff that are actually doing the day-to-day work.\r\n\r\n- Do not expect ANY LEGITIMATE TRAINING or PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. Following the dryest orientation you can imagine,  albeit a perfect reflection of the organization's culture, you can expect to be thrown into the deep end of the pool and swim. At some point your manager will probably point you towards a LinkedIn Learning video to brush up your skills.\r\n\r\n- Organization is siloed to its detriment. Good luck if you need help; it will take days and endless bureaucratic back and forth.\r\n\r\n- Don't expect feedback unless you fail. I've been here for two years and have not once had a performance review or been approached by my manager to discuss anything related to my future plans, areas for improvement, etc.. THE ORGANIZATION (including your boss) does not care. They know you will eventually leave and they'll just replace you with another CHEAP body.\r\n\r\n- Your managers are sheep. They will not stump for you and if you voice concerns about development, compensation, etc. expect them to fall on deaf ears. \r\n\r\n- David Myers will approve your annual 3-4% raise on your less than competitive salary and tell you to be happy with it because you're working for a prestigious research institution.

It is a corporate, not-for-profit organization that basically does consulting work with a large emphasis on research. It is a corporation that doesn't pay its board. Office atmospheres are more laid back than traditional corporations, but the structure, rewards/pay, and culture are all reminiscent of a large corporate consulting firm. Note: the professional services division is more laid back than the assessment division.\r\n\r\nAIR lacks a strategic vision and the leadership necessary to realize that vision. Senior Vice Presidents create their own fiefdoms, which are often in conflict with each other's goals and occasionally with the goals of the organization as a whole. SVPs are generally hard-charging and unwilling to compromise with their direct reports and the management-level staff actually leading the work. There seems to be a complete lack of appreciation for input from the rest of the staff at the top of the organization, as if leadership knows everything about the work, even though they're not actually staffed on projects or working with clients (mainly because they're too expensive). \r\n\r\nAIR is top-heavy, and like many corporate organizations, the top 1-2% seem to make about 50% of the money. The organization recently promoted a group of high-level, high-earning staff to Vice President, without seeing any current VPs or SVPs leave the organization - which means their expenditures on staff went up without also rewarding mid-level and junior staff. It seems like the top people are the only ones who are rewarded with pay.\r\n\r\nMany VPs lack appreciation for work-life balance, which trickles down to even the most junior staff. And while some of the VPs are very entrenched in and knowledgeable about the work of their groups, some are completely clueless but don't feel the need to learn about their staff and what they do. \r\n\r\nThe CEO lacks trust for most employees outside his immediate circle and regularly criticizes AIR's work in large internal meetings, including hardworking employees on both the project and infrastructure/overhead teams. He seems to be against social/technological advancement (unless it applies to quantitative research). \r\n\r\nHardworking and talented employees are only rewarded with more work and not necessarily with promotions or decent raises, which makes them more likely to burn out. The promotion process is not transparent at all. Very few people in the organization seem to understand how an employee can work for a promotion or salary increase, aside from being put up for one by their staff manager multiple times. Most mid-level promotions seem to take about 2-3 years from planning to completion. There are hardworking staff who have been at the same level for 5+ years. Yet there are very few supports for career development. \r\n\r\nAlthough AIR encourages work-life balance, many junior and mid-level staff still feel pressured to work nights and weekends, answering emails when their superiors contact them in off hours. Many times this lack of regard for work-life balance is actually rewarded, especially at the top. \r\n\r\nBecause AIR refuses to invest in infrastructure, administrative staff is stretched way too thin. Most junior and even some mid-level staff are given administrative responsibilities on projects, instead of valuable learning opportunities to grow their careers in research and technical assistance. Almost everyone in the organization is overstaffed, and almost all infrastructure teams are too small. \r\n\r\nAIR really needs a CEO and leadership team who can manage a bunch of strong-willed people with strong personalities, and keep them working together to move in the right direction. They also need to start embracing the 21st century when it comes to communications and business development, including investing in business strategy, sales, and marketing."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Senior Researcher", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "22 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Senior Researcher", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great people and good flexibility in work schedule.

The salary for lower level staff: AIR hired me in at $35,000 and was not willing to negotiate. There is only so much money that one can get for this type of work as an RA but there are definitely companies that will pay in the forty thousands. \r\n2. The out of the way office locations: AIR should consider putting their Washington DC and Silver Spring office locations on the metro. Many of their competitors do this.\r\n3. Corporate is not invested in junior level staff: Corporate is told again and again when junior staff leave that we are not paid appropriately for the Washington D.C. area. I know their attitude is to be less invested in RA's since we leave after a few years but our salaries are not appropriate. While I felt like the senior staff in my department were invested in me and were sad to see me leave I felt that corporate saw me as completely replaceable. During my time at AIR, corporate cut our holiday party and continuously hired in new institute fellows and VPs but the RAs saw very little change in our salaries."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Clique riddled, no work life balance.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Test Development Specialist in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits try to fill in the gaps where pay or commendation lacks.

There is little room for advancement at level 4 and 5.  Pay increases and promotions are not  based on job performance.  Pedigree and relationships with management are what counts.  Though there is an elaborate performance system, it does not function as it should.  Managers tell their staff who is to be promoted, therefore there is no need for a formal performance system.  In some Centers it is rare to see a person of Hispanic or African descent.  They leave quickly.  Certainly there are exceptions but take note of the percentage Black or Hispanic, their tenure and their highest job level to get a better sense of the subtle racism at play.

One of the worst IT organizations I have ever worked for.\r\n \r\n  I have never been the one to look back in life and I pondered whether I should write this review, but I strongly felt anyone who is considering or applying for a job at AIR deserves to read this, so here goes-\r\n \r\n  -The upper management is completely disconnected and unaware of how the work actually gets done at the lowest levels, so puts some of the most unrealistic demands on the teams.\r\n  -This allows the Technical Directors (TDs) to weild more power than they really should and play the dirtiest of games with their staff. There are especially 2 notorious and completely unprofessional TDs in Assessment, you'd never want to be stuck with them.\r\n  -Management is selfish and does not care about its employees. You are simply a cog in a machine. They will undeservingly reap the benefits of your hard work and take home big pay checks and bonuses and won't think twice about kicking you to the curb to save their faces.\r\n  -Very much a old boys club mentality, the entire system is setup to promote and grow only a few and everyone else is simply walking thru a revolving door. Most employees simply do last more than 2 yrs. The turnover rate is staggering yet the management simply doesnt care. The ones who stay longer are usually sucking up coz they are waiting for immigration benefits. The management knows this and takes complete advantage of their situations. The American workforce that sucks up and stays there for several years usually suffers from Stockholm Syndrome.  \r\n  -Honesty, commitment, hard work, technical skills have little meaning here. Expect 0% growth (professionally and financially) unless you kiss the behind of the upper management and lose your soul. You have no creative control. If you say \"No\" or even politely challenge an idea, you are let go without just cause.\r\n  -The client management teams are some of the most unprofessional and incompetant I have ever seen. They have no clue what they are doing. They often load requests from the client at the 11th hour to technical side of the house. So you are working late nights and weekends to meet unrealistic demands while they go socialize over cocktails and have fun in bars.\r\n  -This is a big one - absolutely no reward for hard work. Not even a \"thank you\" for working late or over the weekend to get this done. In fact, the only time I ever heard anything from my manager was when he was creatively thinking about how to blame me for the debacle. \r\n  -This place all around stinks with dirty office politics, back stabbing and blame games. There isnt much of a process there yet you will be blamed for not following a process which they just made up so they blame you. I have seen excellent talent getting thrown under the bus and getting fired for some of the worst reasons. So there isn't much of job security there. But perhaps the biggest impact is how this environment might psychologically affect someone. There are so many people working there who are really on the edge.  \r\n  -HR will absolutely disregard your complaints and side with the management. When management is treating you unfairly or running you to the ground, they will look the other way. HR here has been created ONLY to protect the management, not the average employee. Period.\r\n  -Expect to have NO personal life. Never mind the almost daily harassment from management late during weeknights, I once got called at 11pm when I was on a vacation with family and I was told I need to get online ASAP and finish a task.

How can a company that's supposed to be designed for the purpose of \"improving the lives of the disadvantaged\" truly understand and alleviate the plight of disadvantaged and historically marginalized groups of individuals when it cannot even retain the vast majority of its underrepresented minority employees? \r\n\r\nSecond, the organization is supposed to operate as a nonprofit, but employees are unfairly placed under constant pressure (with failure being the equivalent of being fired) to fight for project work to fully bill their time and keep their jobs. AIR does not operate as a nonprofit; it operates solely as a contracting firm where money and billable hours are the bottom line. This often leads to unnecessary competition, backstabbing, and an often hostile working environment, particularly for employees from underrepresented backgrounds who generally don't have the support needed to have a fair chance to succeed. \r\n\r\nFinally, as several other posts have mentioned, the recent layoffs of over 30 employees at AIR provide a true disservice for an organization whose management chose to operate like a multi-billion dollar, cutthroat corporate organization instead of a nonprofit. For those left behind after the layoffs, it was very difficult for many to pick up the additional workload after so many individuals suddenly disappeared after being laid off without any sort of warning. Overall, the situation and the way so many long-term, hard working employees were treated was a true testament of how the mission of improving the lives of the others is nothing more than a facade."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Values driven company struggling with growth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "21 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You'll work with great, smart colleagues.
