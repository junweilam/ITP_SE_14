I had many opportunities for project management and professional development. If I had an idea, I had to justify it, plan it, and assure it was executed responsibly.

Throughout the years, as the education landscape shifted, and its funding model came under threat, our organization transitioned from serving primary, secondary and post-secondary students to working exclusively with high school graduates helping them get through college and beyond.  \r\n\r\nDuring the transition, we were not always sure that our doors would remain open.  I watched Melissa plan and work tirelessly to maintain not only quality programming for our students, but also ensure that our workforce could move forward so that staff could remain employed.  It was her vision that led to the development of a robust College and Alumni Program that allowed for continuing to serve the Wave-Makers who had already been in the program for years, as well as be able to recruit and assist new students to help them persist through college.  I am sure that were it not for her efforts, the program would not still exist, in any form\u2014which would be a shame considering all the students, families and staff who were helped over the years, and continue to be so.  \r\n\r\nWe were a small start-up in the beginning, which meant everyone performed multiple jobs, including the boss.  Melissa spent much time performing many of the job duties\u2014inclusive of working directly with students\u2014for which she would later hire staff as we grew.  This gave her direct insight and perspective into the challenges and needs of staff that made her an effective advocate for her employees within the larger organization.  She constantly researched and familiarized herself with changing trends in the field that fueled her decision-making and allowed our organization to remain relevant and sustainable in its practices.  \r\n\r\nMy career development and professional growth were encouraged under her direction.  I would describe her leadership style as confident and tough, but fair.  She had high expectations regarding quality of work, which was critical considering the under-resourced students we served.  She was always very open to suggestions to address our evolving needs as we grew, and advocated constantly for not only our students, but the employees\u2019 needs as well.  Staff were encouraged to generate ideas that would allow our work to improve.  If we saw a more efficient way to approach a task or arrive at a needed outcome, we could submit a proposal to demonstrate the viability of the idea, and actually be allowed to implement the procedural change moving forward, for which we received the credit within the organization.  Hard work was always rewarded, and there was room for progression in responsibilities, professional growth, and job and salary advancement.  \r\n\r\nWhen I reflect on my career trajectory since then, I have developed a sincere appreciation for my time working at Making Waves.
