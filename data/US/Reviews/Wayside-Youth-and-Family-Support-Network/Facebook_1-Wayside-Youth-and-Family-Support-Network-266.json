There are several things that happened that made me realize that this place isn't all what it seems to be. First off, almost 95% of the time the morning shift was late which meant you staying for 30-two hours more. And after not sleeping the whole night, it is extremely difficult to stay awake and it was so frustrating. Secondly, management was never helpful and they were extremely unorganized. After being awake for 10 hours, sometimes you would have to drive students to school even though my supervisor just started her shift.  I found this to be extremely dangerous for the employees and for the kids. My supervisor had favorites and it was recognizable within the first weeks. Also my first week there, another coworker was telling me all these horrible stories about working there and it made me second guess my decision right away.  I never felt like I was welcomed there and you are mostly by yourself. I had a horrible experience where I was working the night shift with another coworker, however, she did not have access to the other buildings and could not leave the unit. With my supervisor knowing that a new client was unstable, she assigned me that shift. It was a very scary shift since I was new and had very little training. And the other employer couldn't get help as a regular Wayside employee could. When I called my supervisor to let her know what was happening, she was very rude to me and did not help at all. After that night, I didn't want to come back. Working night shifts is not for everyone. You get very restless and it was clear that it was changing my personality and motivation throughout the day. It always felt like my eyes were bloodshot for staying up. I never really felt like the employees were helping the kids and always seemed annoyed whenever approached by one of them. Lastly, when I gave my two weeks noticed to both of my supervisors they completely ignored me for my last week\u2019s there. They never asked why I was leaving and anything. They didn't even say good morning. I felt very uncomfortable and it made me realized that I needed to leave. I thought for people working with kids to get better they made you feel crappy about yourself. I worked hard in college and have a bachelor\u2019s degree in Psychology so I was shocked how this place handled certain situations. Also, don't eat the food there. I got very sick during one of my shifts but since my supervisor didn't want to come in I had to stay there all night long. I would think twice about working here. And as another review said, they sent an internal email to all the employees to give Wayside high ratings on here."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Wayside Is NOT On Your Side!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Residential Care in Framingham, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Looks nice from the parking lot!

The mental and emotional health of employees is on the bottom of upper managements list of priorities and each program is poorly run by the same management group.

Those employees who don\u2019t adhere to upper managements unwritten rules will be punished with difficult work schedules, excessive micromanagement and unfair/false reviews. These reviews are also meant as a way to repress employees, as there is little to no room for advancement within the agency. Most reviews are purposely falsified, as upper management has told directors in the past to create reviews riddled with negative feedback. Upper management then uses these reviews as a tool to limit growth of employees.\n\nAssaults by clients happen on a frequent basis and employees are encouraged to not seek additional supports around these assaults. If a staff member has been viciously assaulted, they are discouraged from taking legal action and threatened with discipline if they disregard the suggestions of upper management. Wayside management does not want \u201cnegative press\u201d around their agency due to past situations where they were mentioned in the mainstream media. Those stories did not present them in a positive light.\n\nBusiness accounts are also not safe with leaders of the agency. There was a Waltham property that was mismanaged before its sale, which could have offset some losses regularly incurred during the summer. Due to the mismanagement and lack of upkeep, it cost many employees their careers at Wayside, as the agency terminated part of their workforce due to lack of revenue."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Innovative and Caring Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Continuum Youth Support Worker in Framingham, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great employee benefits, wonderful supervisory staff, plenty of opportunity for growth, creative administrative staff the truly care about every single employee.", "cons": "Medical record system can be somewhat of a pain, but manageable.
