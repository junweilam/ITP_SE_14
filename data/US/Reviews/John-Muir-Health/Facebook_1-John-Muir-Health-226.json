These are personal choices that we will continue to honor and support ....\" . This is an obvious political opinion, and for an employer that employs thousands of people from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds, I was shocked that Senior Leadership would be ok putting out such a statement. And many of my colleagues have shared similar sentiments. Being inclusive is a good thing, but like all good things, too much of it becomes bad, and they appear to have lost sight of that. As a simple example, the cafeteria, which has always been fabulous, now insists on having themed food days where ALL of the food served is from a certain culture. And quite frankly, there are certain cultural cuisines that very few employees like! On those days, the cafeteria is deserted! Which not only reduces the amount of money the cafeteria brings in (they have to make money too, like any business), and the employees that count on the convenience of the cafeteria for lunch or dinner end up having to purchase pre-packaged food instead or Door Dash food or bring food from home (which of course is the healthiest choice but not always convenient)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "JMH", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Executive Director in Walnut Creek, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people and core mission to provide great care", "cons": "Corporate partners have too much influence"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not great for promotions", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Ancillary staff", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No checks and balances in place when the entire management team knows each other and hires their friends.
