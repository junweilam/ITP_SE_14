I personally had a very good experience, supported by my peers and supervisors, and given plenty of opportunities to move my career forward. Remote work is hard on every institution and employee, but CSIS did a pretty good job of keeping people engaged, seeking their opinions/needs/feedback, listening seriously, and often coming through with generous solutions. It's a very good jumping-off point coming out of college or graduate school.\r\n\r\nCSIS has a very decentralized structure, which enables programs to really dive into the research they want to do (and can find funding for.) When I was there, leadership was just beginning to work out some oversight mechanisms to smoothen out event schedules, keep an eye on the overall message and timing, etc. but overall it's a light touch.

For example, I am amazed that so few (when I was there, maybe as much as 1% of the total) Fellows and Research Associates were Black American or Hispanic American. One reason for that might be that each program hires independently, so it's difficult to pressure any one program to seek diversity in hiring."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Low pay, poor work-life balance, but do cool stuff", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Associate Director in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "See your work published and recognized across the world", "cons": "Low pay, poor work-life balance"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Research Intern in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good culture and appreciative of interns", "cons": "No real complaints other than remote"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great for internship", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Research Intern", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great connections and learning experience", "cons": "Projects can get overwhelming on extremely rare occasions"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Love it", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the best work culture EVER.

From talking with other interns and new employees, many are promised that if they take low wages (many that are sub-minimum wage), experts will give them lots of career advice and connections so that after your tenure, you will have many opportunities. Plain and simple, this does not happen for 75% of people I met. Most end up having to find opportunities completely on their own. The main reason to take an entry or intern level position here would be for good experience, mentorship, and connections. The only thing you get is experience, but most of that can be attained by just reading reports and going to events. From a transactional point of view, there's little reason to work here; only do if you know for certain that a certain team or expert has a track record of really investing in younger staff development.\r\n\r\n(2) The culture is overly professional and militaristic in its strictness. This probably stems from the CEOs background in the military but is totally unwarranted in a research environment. You will be reprimanded for not wearing a suit AND tie everyday, for being even 5 minutes late, and -- to my worst surprise -- for asking questions to experts. I was specifically told that CSIS is not an environment where I'm allowed to raise questions (privately, too, not publicly) of an expert's research. It's a heads down environment everyday. Considering the wage, industry, and CSIS's own outward facing branding of being innovative, this is totally out of place and ineffective towards its research goals.\r\n\r\n(3) I met many young people who joined the institute out of a hope that research can help improve some aspect of global society. Many left jaded. CSIS may be nonpartisan as a whole, but its teams are small and often individually dependent on funding. This means that the few funders of each team have a disproportionate say in driving research agenda and (in private meetings) not-so-subtly indicating what kinds of conclusions they hope to see from research. There *is* a decent amount of truly nonpartisaned research being done, but a *very* significant portion is a distorted version of corporate propaganda. This is why some elected representatives have called for think tank donations to be made public. I became jaded for working in the think tank space - but I'm still hoping to find other avenues for change.\r\n\r\nIf your goal is to do research or drive positive change in the world, you won't have very much opportunities at CSIS, even if you have a few. For the wages and 1950s corporate culture, it's clear that this institute isn't worth most people's time. You might as well go for a consulting firm, or the research arm of a large bank, where you at least have the pay to match the poor workplace conditions."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to be", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Talented people, get to learn a lot while you work", "cons": "Your experience will come down to your team and supervisors"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "CSIS PC Salary", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- substantial responsibility and strong comrodery", "cons": "- poor HR and lack of upward mobility"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good place to work, senior leadership is very insular", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Deputy Director in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work if you're on the right team and you have a boss who is willing to fight for you to get raises/recognition.", "cons": "Senior corporate leadership is very insular and largely unchanged in last 10-15 years.

There are large disparities in pay and position title between people with similar qualifications and responsibilities across departments.
