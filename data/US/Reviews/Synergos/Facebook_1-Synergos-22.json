The actual activities of the organization are vague and not clear even to those who work there. The majority of revenue goes to staff salaries. The organization has had a lot of executive leadership turnover in the last 6 years. They started a three-person co-CEO team in 2021. Rather than let go of the previous CEO who mismanaged a strategy process and wasted resources they instead brought in two other women to take on 2/3 of his work . The organization is founder-driven, which in turn contributes to a culture of fear and confusion. The founder does not listen to staff feedback. Employees that do speak up, and with whom she disagrees, are often shamed and excluded. The founder also talks negatively about these employees to their peers. There are no professional development pathways for staff. Promotions are given out haphazardly and to those with the loudest internal advocates. At least 8 staff left in 2021 because of these conditions. All of these factors contribute to a very challenging, toxic work environment. It is unfortunate because Synergos presents well to those on the outside, which is not an accurate representation."
