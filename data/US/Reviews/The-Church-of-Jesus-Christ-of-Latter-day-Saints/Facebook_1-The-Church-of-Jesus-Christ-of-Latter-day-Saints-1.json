And I will say without hesitation that the working environment at the Church is the best anywhere I have been as a software engineer. We rarely work more than a 40-hour work week (occasional, but rare emergencies might be the exception). The management stresses it - they truly want us to work an eight-hour day and then go home to be with our families. It's wonderful. \r\n\r\nYes, bureaucracy, politics, etc. exist at the Church like anywhere else. But it is far less than most other places in my opinion. Almost everyone is simply trying to do the right thing most of the time while putting team needs and the purpose of the Church ahead of personal egos, self-centered views, etc. Agile and software development processes, while not perfect (it never is), and it varies from project to project, are for the most part what they should be: team-focused (without ignoring individual needs/wants), light-weight, flexible, and the teams are allowed to be self-organizing - more so than anywhere else I have worked. The net result is a much more productive work environment. I can get double the amount of work done in a 40-hour week at the Church than I could somewhere else in a 60-hour week. Everywhere else I have worked in Corporate America stifles productivity/innovation with their never-ending focus on heavy-weight Agile nonsense (SAFe anyone?) and Agile dogma. This is nothing more than inefficient waterfall processes that are wrapped in an Agile label so that the executives feel good about \"doing Agile\". Not at the Church - these things are done the way they were intended to be (with minimal exceptions here and there.) \r\n\r\nTraining is good, as long as there is budget for it, which there usually is. The technology stack is good - not always \"bleeding edge\", but they try to keep up for the most part. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to work on projects that give me a greater understanding of the Church's purpose and inner, organizational way of doing things. Working on projects that I feel a strong sense of purpose enhances the productivity, and enjoyment of work. \r\n\r\nWorking remotely is the preferred way of working for IT professionals at the Church - although some people work in the office, most work from home. Video chatting/working with other team members is efficient and works well. Most teams have occasional team activities and occasional in-office team meetings to ensure that team members see each other face-to-face on occasion. \r\n\r\nThe benefits are good. Health insurance (DMBA) has many options with low monthly premiums and no deductibles for in-network healthcare. (One negative side effect of this is the lack of health savings accounts - low deductible plans are not available for this. There are the FSA health savings spending accounts available, however.) Low co-pays also. Dental insurance is good also. \r\n\r\nVacation/sick leave are excellent. I never have a problem requesting vacation time. \r\n\r\nRetirement benefits are very good. They have a 4-percent 401K match and an 8-percent additional that you are just gifted. Not much beats that.", "cons": "Salary might be a little below the norm - but with recent salary adjustments, they are trying to address this so that pay is closer to the mean. Obviously, no bonuses, or other cash incentives. \r\n\r\nNone of the many perks that you might get at another tech company. \r\n\r\nComputer equipment is average at best. \r\n\r\nIt can be difficult to get a full-time position. I had to be a contractor for a while before a full-time position opened up. \r\n\r\nReally, there isn't much to add here - I am stretching to find many \"cons\"."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "MY WORK EXPERIENCE", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Social Media Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company does very well in helping people stay connected, and share daily scriptural insights to the benefit of every individual that reads it.

They seem way more interested in their own power and legacy than doing what is best for the business.   They make it pretty obvious they have the power to fire individuals or reorg the group at their whim and even leadership is afraid to challenge them.  As a result the directors often seem uncertain or schizophrenic in their decisions.  It is extraordinarily political and often who you know and are friends with is more important than what you can do.  It is pretty clear to most that employees are viewed as a commodity that can be discarded or at least have their role minimized at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nOutside of that one department, I believe the management to be much more open to different ideas and supportive of individual success.\r\n\r\nGenerally in the whole Church, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a raise or promotion outside of the typical cost of living increase each year.

There is a flavor of the day mentality that long time employees have seen for many, many years. Major process and tool changes happen annually. Major reorganizations happen every few years. Significant layoffs happen about every 5 years. Tons of folks are hired as contracted ESG or Nexeo employees with an implied promise that if they work hard and do well, they'll be hired on full time. We spend tons of time and money training them and incorporating them into critical roles, and then we let them go when their contract expires.\r\n\r\nCommunication in the department was terrible under previous management, and is better now, but still not great. There is still intense fear of losing one's job, even among full time employees. There is still enormous ambiguity around the most recent initiative to reorganize and simplify. And there is still a feeling that the old \"regime\" is mostly still in place.\r\n\r\nPeople see that certain managers bounce around from position to completely unrelated position about every year, and they aren't leaving wild successes in their wake. At best, they seem to be average managers. What are employees supposed to think when there are free spirits who can apparently change their job whenever they feel like it, but they are always involved in high level initiatives and discussions? There is a feeling of favoritism, and if you're not on the list, you'll never make very high.\r\n\r\nThe way finances in the department are handled is messy, time consuming, and difficult. Financial information is almost always out of date, yet finance is always asking employees for more and more work to make their lives easier, rather than the other way around. We waste tons of time tracking and then approving billable hours.\r\n\r\nThe listing here on Glassdoor is terribly misleading. Every department is wildly different in how it is run and its goals and management.

I was gaslighted and sexually harassed within my group, and my coworkers often would joke about being able to get rid of people if they didn't like them. So I was afraid to say anything, I couldn't afford to lose my job.  I have never in any job experienced the level of toxicity I did in that job. My coworkers destroyed others everyday, they made everyone look bad to upper management and shifted the blame to others whenever they could. I tried to tell management what was happening but my team would come back and blame me and say its my problem and to deal with it. It was such an abusive environment. I also feel bad for my friends in other departments who experienced horrible trauma, one even said working for the church was a lot worse than going through divorce.\r\n\r\nAlso, management often doesn't to want to hear input, and it is insanely difficult to get paid even the average/normal wage for your skill sets. Its frustrating to hear you get blessed in other ways for taking a steep pay cut while you're struggling to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nPeople often don't like talking about these events at the church office because it often affects others negatively and impacts their view of the church, but this isn't uncommon.

Second, the corporate culture is something to frown upon. If you don't fit the typical Utah Mormon mold, best of luck to you.  Prepare for some scrutiny. There's no professional development here. Also, they don't offer any onsite perks. You just work, work, work, work, and work. Management also never shows appreciation for their employees. There is NO autonomy and you are not allowed to make your own decisions. Your breaks are timed and if you go over just ONE MINUTE, you'll be reported. If you go on the internet while on your shift, you will be reported. They also keep track of how much time you spend off the phones. If you're not busy enough, they'll give you a \"Subject Matter Expert TASK\" like training other people, doing quality assurance on calls, writing instructions (technical writing) but for no additional pay. BUT, taking calls is your FIRST priority. There is no sort of flexibility in your schedule. You are expected to live and breathe work. \r\n\r\nThere's an overwhelming amount of things to do on a day-to-day basis.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most disappointing thing about this place is, they don't practice what they preach. Employees are expected to treat work like church and are expected to \"lead like the savior,\" but management treats us all like we're disposable. The turnover here is quite high, because if you had other options, why would you stay in a place that makes you feel like you're nothing?

I was forced out by my abusers and the abusers were protected by the legal team and still have their jobs. I had 8 years of \"exceeds\" and \"greatly exceeds\" (BYU + Church Employment) yet after 9 days at a new job at the Temple Department my job was threatened by an abusive manager and he made good on his threats to terminate me. I was a whistle blower and got forced out. I can't provide details here but use a search engine to search for \"Abuse in LDS Employment\" and you will find my blog where you can get full details and then make up your own mind. Employment by the church was the worst employment experience in my life and it should have been the best. I still believe the church is true despite what I went through. I wrote the HR Department, Temple Department, and General Authorities and all ignored me multiple times. They won't even respond to my letters despite the abuse I suffered and the evidence I presented. It was really shocking and incredibly unbelievable that they would ignore such damning facts about their managers. After 10 years I am still in shock. Abuse occurred as an employee of a temple and as an employee in the Temple Department. I learned the hard way that Church Employment does not care about their employees - I was used, abused, and then discarded. I resigned before they could fire me because I was \"not a good fit\". I pressed my manager hard when he came in to inform me that I was being let go because I was not a good fit and he said my work was excellent and there were no problems with me as an employee or my work - and I recorded it. Interestingly, when I appealed they suddenly found reasons for my termination. That shows a severe lack of integrity but it's legal - they can fire you for no reason and get away with it. And, they did. Just be warned church employment is not always blissful.
