This in itself causes budgetary guidelines to be off from what would generally considered acceptable for a department at other companies.\r\n\r\nI have to say that during my tenure at SIFE I have been constantly impressed by how hard working, caring, and capable the people are around me.  I truly believe that the mission of the organization is important and on the right path.  Charismatic and passionate leadership at all levels of management help to drive the organization in a unified direction.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in dealing with unique challenges, especially in creating innovative solutions on a shoestring budget, this could definitely be the place for you.  I've found it educational in my own way to work at SIFE.  Moving from the privately and publicly held enterprise to the non-profit sphere can be shocking and challenging, but it is well worth it to see the impact you make or you facilitate in making happen.\r\n\r\nWhile the pay rate is below local market standards, the benefits package is second to none.  Management has a great respect for work/life balance and they are very easy-going about taking time off and working out making that time up so that an hour here or there doesn't eat into your paid time.  First rate medical and dental coverage, and good opportunities for retirement investing.", "cons": "I don't think this is unique to SIFE, it's definitely a challenge at all non-profits, but the largest downside to being employed at SIFE is that your pay rate is not within the band usually considered appropriate for your job duties, responsibilities, and skill level in the local market.  Expect to make 50-70% of what is generally considered median pay for your job title and skill.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while I feel that senior management is extremely passionate about what they do, and they have a clear and positive vision for the future, there is an inordinate amount of internal politics for an organization of this size.  At times, when trying to make anything from minor to major changes, it would be near impossible to move forward due to internal politics and bureaucracy.  I think much if this has to do with a conscious effort on the part of management to be judicious in their spending, but in many ways it can make the job more stressful and unsatisfying than necessary.\r\n\r\nOverall I think SIFE is a good organization with a good mission, and that they are successful and will continue to be successful, but they definitely have some challenges ahead.  Most of the challenges I feel they've experienced have come down to funding and mismanagement of people resources.  We've got a very high turn-over rate in some job areas compared to other organizations of our size in the local market."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great first job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Apr 2013", "job_title": "Program Manager in Springfield, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Travel all over the US and to international locations, great mission, great people, glad to have a job during tough economic times, good for young singles", "cons": "Non-profit pay lower than private sector, career advancement difficult, constant travel makes it hard if you have a family, headquarters based in Springfield MO is not a great location to fly from, often had to drive to Kansas City to fly out because airfares were so prohibitive from Springfield"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Helped me learn a lot", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Student Leader in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Builds your entrepreneurial skills\r\n- Gives you a platform to create real impact on the society\r\n- Leaves space for experimentation and learning", "cons": "There aren't many downsides, except that it is difficult to manage it with college.
