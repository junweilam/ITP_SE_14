Even though everyone has a full plate, colleagues are happy to collaborate and support with projects outside the scope of their work, within reason of course. \n\n- Flat org structure: Leadership is accessible and good at sharing \"air time\" during meetings. My encounters with leadership have always been positive for the most part.\n\n- Culture and values: GD takes its culture seriously. We have a \"people\" team that provides many opportunities to get staff input on initiatives and solicit feedback on culture. Though it's still a work in progress (see cons), I am heartened by the org's demonstrated commitment to building a strong, positive culture.\n\n- Mission: GD's mission is AMBITIOUS and a real example of effective altruism. Our approach to putting recipients first and respecting their right to choose what they do with their cash is unlike many other similar orgs, and I wholeheartedly think it's the way to go.\n\n- Salary is fairly competitive compared to other similarly-sized nonprofits", "cons": "- DE&I/representation: There is a ton of work going on behind the scenes on moving the needle with respect to DE&I at the org. Staff participate in focus groups, the org has outlined clear goals, etc. That said, even though the majority of staff identify as Black and/or from the communities we serve, leadership unsurprisingly is mostly white. This has been acknowledged and I am eager to see more diversity and representation in leadership as the org grows.\n\n- Burnout: Similarly, work at GD can be hectic and cut into other parts of life. Some managers/colleagues are really good at managing this and setting boundaries, but lots aren't. GD often takes stock of which staff members are feeling burned out, but it's not clear what's being done about it.\n\n- Ambiguity: GD is more start-up-y than other traditional aid orgs, which is good if you like having a lot of ownership over projects and forging your own path. For others that might prefer more structure and preexisting systems, it might be a harder environment to adapt to."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "GD Employee Feedback.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Field Officer in Kaliro, Kamuli", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "\u2022GD has grate values that I have carried and used even in personal life .\n\u2022Feedback culture that gives room for improvement .\n\u2022 I love reaching out to the needy and I feel comfortable giving back with out expectations ,GD has it great .\n\u2022I have learnt alot while at Givedirectly ie working remotely ,in refuggee settlements ,and I love the interaction with new people and purported reciepients.\n\u2022Change in remuneration.", "cons": "\u2022operating on short contracts,I would really love to work longer to impact more lives ."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Deal", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Customer Care Representative in Monrovia", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to broaden your experience in the service space with enriching memories to grow professionally.", "cons": "It's hard with the partiality.
