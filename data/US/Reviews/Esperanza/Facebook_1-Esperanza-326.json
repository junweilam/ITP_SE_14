Another pro is you form some very tight relationships with your students, many of whom did not do well in traditional school, due to bullying, or moving to a new neighborhood, or needing a special schedule to accomodate other goals (e.g., sports training, the need for a job during traditional school hours, etc.)", "cons": "Administration expects huge amounts of work to be produced, which can only really happen if you are working 24/7 at work, at home, on your weekends, and missing hours worth of sleep.
