The health, vacation, and retirement benefits are top-tier for an American organization (if you qualify for them). \r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy working for the Smithsonian.

That said, as an organization, OHR is broken. It is EXTREMELY slow at processing HR actions, it makes a lot of mistakes, and the hiring/promotion process is completely opaque. At this point, it is expected that hiring actions (new hires, converting contractors to employees, promotions) will take MULTIPLE YEARS to go through. This is not an exaggeration - this is my personal experience, and the experience of many of my coworkers. \r\n\r\nBecause OHR is dysfunctional, there is an overreliance on independent contractors - people who are doing the same great work as staff, but with zero benefits and more income tax burden. Independent contractors do often convert to full time employees, but there is absolutely no guarantee of this. \r\n\r\nFinally, because funding is limited and there is such high demand to work for the Smithsonian, they can and do lowball employees on salary. Many employees are hired at the equivalent of a GS-5 or GS-7 grade. Look at GS salary tables for the Washington DC area and really consider whether you can support yourself on the pay they offer. Additionally, make sure you get grade increases (i.e. promotions) written into your position description, because otherwise you are not eligible for grade increases without going through the (dysfunctional) competitive hiring process."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Scientist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Full time research positions with modest research support.", "cons": "Bureaucracy places heavy demands on time."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "ok", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Finance Business Partner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "it is an OK place to work", "cons": "None that I can think of"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "good experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Systems Administrator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "surrounded by interesting people and installations", "cons": "commuting and working some holidays"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Work life balance good, impact not so good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Project Director in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nobody is overworked\r\nreal research and data are part of mission\r\nmuseums are awesome", "cons": "nothing can move agilely or quickly\r\nbureaucracy is frustrating"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "good stuff", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Editor in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic colleagues and mission driven", "cons": "No clear path for advancement"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Research Fellow in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place, work atmosphere for fellows.", "cons": "Very few networking opportunities for Fellows."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Loved it here", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 May 2022", "job_title": "TI Fabricator", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing people.

To advance, most people must leave the organization or move between different internal units.
