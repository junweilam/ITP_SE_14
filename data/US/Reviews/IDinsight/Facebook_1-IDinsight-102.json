To me, the organization offers a unique combination of rigorous, meaningful work and high professional standards. My favorite parts of the job:\r\n\r\n- Genuine commitment to impact. I'm constantly surprised and impressed by the emphasis put on improving the world, over and above things like getting good publicity or a more lucrative contract. \r\n\r\n- Opportunities for skill development. This can be easy to lose sight of during a project crunch when all you're doing is writing a report or cleaning data, but in the time I've been at IDinsight I've learned so much. I've gotten to build on existing skills, like writing and using Stata for data analysis; and add many new ones, like public speaking, client management, people management, large-scale data collection, SurveyCTO, etc. When and if I move on to another job, I know I'm much better prepared than I was when I started.\r\n\r\n- Amazing colleagues. When I catch up with old classmates I often hear about how much they miss the intellectual stimulation of being at university and getting to engage in high-level debates about politics, ethics, and how to make the world a better place. I actually _don't_ miss that, because IDinsighters are an incredible group of people! I think that's partly due to (self) selection, and partly due to opportunities the organization creates to encourage interesting exchanges and build relationships. We often take time out of busy days to hear from a guest speaker or discuss an interesting new paper. Most importantly, people are kind and hardworking. Although people come in with a range of opinions and experiences, there's a common thread of sincerity and dedication that I really value. I know I could message just about anyone in the organization with a question or request and they'd take time out of their day to help out.\r\n\r\n- The range of opportunities available to IDinsighters at all levels and positions. I've personally benefitted from being trusted with a lot of responsibility early on, and also just enjoy being part of an organization that provides those opportunities to others: from an Associate presenting evaluation results to a high-level government official, to Field Managers running trainings on SurveyCTO for incoming Managers & Directors, to Economists spending weeks on location with a project to pitch in. At the rate we're growing, there are also lots of exciting (albeit sometimes unpredictable) opportunities for professional growth. I know a number of people who have carved out fulfilling roles for themselves by matching their own skills and interests to a newly identified organizational need.\r\n\r\n- The clients! I know that might sound trite but I'm completely sincere. By and large, we do a great job of selecting inspiring, impactful organizations to work with. I feel incredibly fortunate knowing that if I do my job well, I can help our clients better serve poor and marginalized communities.", "cons": "From my perspective, the biggest potential downsides of working here are:\r\n\r\n- High levels of independence can sometimes feel like a lack of support. IDinsight has taken positive steps to mitigate that (for example, every employee has an 'advisor' who's senior to them and a 'buddy' who's a peer, in addition to their direct supervisor; there are regular 'team health checks' and other opportunities to give upward feedback), but I know it can be tough at times for people who are in remote offices or have a supervisor who's based elsewhere. That level of independence and responsibility is exciting for some people and stressful for others, and I think it's wise to be thoughtful about which camp you might fall in before taking a job here.\r\n\r\n- A lot depends on your project. Managers and Directors are more likely to work on multiple projects, but Associates generally work on just one project at a time and may be on a single project for their first 1-2 years with IDinsight. On the one hand, this staffing model allows Associates to develop expertise on that project and engage in a deeper way with the sector and client. The pace of most IDinsight projects also means that over the course of two years most Associates will get exposure to all project phases (client development, evaluation design, fieldwork, analysis, report writing, etc, not necessarily in that order). On the other hand, this means there's some luck involved in whether and when you get to work on a particular sector/client type/methodology. If you're at the beginning of your career and already have very specific goals (e.g. you're passionate about health and only want to work on that type of project; or you already know you're applying to econ PhDs and absolutely must work on an RCT in your first six months) then I'd recommend looking for a job with a narrower focus."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Parody of what a non-profit should be", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Smart co-workers, interesting office locations, work from home options (ironically only for expats), moderately interesting projects", "cons": "-Poor senior leadership, passive aggressive, lack of management skills\r\n-Serious diversity problem among management, managers are extremely waspy\r\n-Promises largely unfilled - exceedingly fast promotion tracks that do not reflect skill development - promotions are handed out to employees to persuade them to stay and not based on actual performance\r\n-Lip service is given to \"impact\", but IDinsight's business imperative seems to be the only thing that matters\r\n-Repeated complaints about a partner went unaddressed, creating a toxic atmosphere\r\n-Some partners seem to have one foot out the door - which can be very discouraging for current employees\r\n-Only room for growth if you have the right people going up to bat for you\r\n-Culture and \"IDinsight values\" are forced on employees and those that do not fit those arbitrary values and mentality of senior management (see diversity above) do not find a place in the organization\r\n-Borderline racist hierarchy - creating a low level entry job for those with African university degrees+experience, but those with US degrees automatically get hired into Associate positions"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great colleagues; poorly run organization", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- People are smart, driven, and ambitious\r\n- Most people are down-to-earth and care about each other\r\n- Interesting office locations and good way to get your foot in the development sector as a young professional\r\n- Opportunity to work with prominent clients in the sector", "cons": "- Extremely delayed decision-making processes because several senior leaders are afraid of taking risks and making mistakes; they get involved in the minute details of tasks instead of focusing on the bigger picture and trusting their teams to make sound decisions\r\n- Unnecessarily hierarchical - for ex. if you are a high performing Associate, be prepared to be held back because of an unstated \u201cpolicy\u201d that says that Associates need to complete 2 years at IDinsight before being promoted (this doesn\u2019t apply to other levels of staff for whom promotions are actually merit-based)\r\n- Nonexistent external communication/little brand value even though we are doing cutting-edge work - hopefully this will get better as we grow the Strategic Communications team"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "A team of smart, passionate colleagues with ambitious goals", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Partner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Over four years in the org at different levels, I saw projects being turned down repeatedly that would've been good for prestige, funding, or client relationships, but were lacking in being demand-driven and high-potential for impact. It is exceedingly rare to find an organisation in international development as willing to put its money where its mouth is on its values and concern for social impact.\r\n- Staying focused on impact requires operational flexibility; IDinsight is committed to this. When you work in development you realise how deviously difficult and uncertain it is to create meaningful, lasting change in social programs and institutional structures. Your best shot at this is to remain flexible in service-type, team structure, role etc. This creates organisational uncertainty, but there is no doing away with this if you want to hold onto the nimbleness that creating impact requires.\r\n- IDinsight is truly a learning organisation. They shine the measurement and learning light back on themselves and are committed to measuring org impact.

You won\u2019t find many other organizations trying to do what IDinsight is trying to do. Also, IDinsight is willing to change its tactics to adapt to what they think will be more effective, or to what they think the sector wants.\r\n\u2022\tQuite flexible with office work schedules. No one will be counting your hours unless you\u2019re under-performing. Very generous with work remote options (mostly a \u201ccommon sense\u201d or \u201cbest judgment\u201d policy, as with many other policies at IDinsight). \r\n\u2022\t(Expat only) You\u2019ll gain valuable overseas experience you can market to your next job. There\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t be located in the same country (if Africa) or state (if India) as your project, but it looks better for you in the development sector job market than working from the US or Europe.\r\n\u2022\tYou\u2019ll work with some name-brand clients, and establish a robust professional network.\r\n\u2022\tYou will learn *a lot* (sector knowledge, coding, field work, managing projects, working with people, working with clients, so on).\r\n\u2022\tEveryone receives formal, 360 degree performance evaluations (2 per year).

Fantastic entry-level job in the development sector.", "cons": "\u2022\tMost fundamental \u2018con\u2019: the vast majority of projects do not live up to what IDinsight says it\u2019s doing. They\u2019re not demand driven, they\u2019re only sometimes informing relatively minor decisions, and they do not achieve tangible impact (but IDinsight will often attribute impact to themselves based on weak assumptions, which seems contradictory for an evaluation firm\u2026). For every success story you hear about, there are 10 more fundamentally broken projects with no path to impact (you\u2019ll notice that you\u2019ll hear about the same success stories over and over again because i] there are so few and ii] there\u2019s very little external communication).\r\n\u2022\tIDinsight is willing to adapt its strategy (pro), but that also means they\u2019re constantly experimenting with their services. As a result, they\u2019ll regularly commit to unfamiliar work, work without clear objectives, or work with uncertain paths to impact.\r\n\u2022\tIDinsight regularly selects projects based on factors other than social impact: maintain/creating client relationships, funding, or other \u201cstrategic\u201d reasons.\r\n\u2022\tYour experience as an associate (and your perception of IDinsight in general) is highly dependent on the project you\u2019re assigned to (the amount of field work vs. quantitative/coding vs. client-facing time vs. writing); and there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll get the project you want or like. Some get lucky, others don\u2019t. You\u2019ll do best if you don\u2019t care and you\u2019re just willing to learn as much as possible.\r\n\u2022\tThe pipeline of new projects naturally does not align with the pipeline of new hires. IDinsight tends to hire in cohorts, but takes on projects continuously. You\u2019ll won\u2019t a project waiting for you when you\u2019re hired. *As a new associate, you can easily go your first 3-6 months without a project.* \r\n\u2022\tEveryone is young, which also means inexperienced. This is expected for associates, but it\u2019s an issue with leadership.\r\n\u2022\t(Expats only) Not very diverse in terms of socioeconomic backgrounds.\r\n\u2022\tYoung organization is not without growing pains. IDinsight hasn\u2019t figured out or not yet addressed things you can take as given in organizations that have been around longer. \r\n\u2022\tAlmost nonexistent external communications (they\u2019re working on it. re: young organization)\r\n\u2022\tKnowledge management isn\u2019t great (again, they\u2019re working on it).
