There is a strong culture of favoritism, particularly for males.  There is a lot of talk about accountability, but that is only true of some line staff. Senior management never take responsibility for errors or mismanagement and there is an expectation for all personnel not to question or complain the bad decisions made.  An agency that wants you to pretend you are part of an innovative, forward looking organization while you are working in a bloated dinosaur run by people interested in maintaining their salaries and status.

Each time they have attempted to fix it after I caught their errors (which have been major - most recently, they deleted 1 month of my earned time off from their system. Another time they forgot to give me benefits after I signed up for them. I could go on..). Those poor people who don't check their pay stubs for accuracy!\r\n\r\nThe outpatient and school-based programs are the most well-run, and the Wraparound program is the least well-run. I can't speak for the group home, but it seems pretty poorly run as well.\r\n\r\nI've stayed at Hathaway Sycamores for 7 years because I didn't have viable alternatives (I figured that all DMH jobs would be similar), and I have valued the kids I have served. But, I strongly believe that the billing and paperwork demands on DMH agencies becomes the primary focus of the work, to the detriment of the clients and the morale of the employees.\r\n\r\nI also strongly believe that this agency will not change their ways. Despite significant record-lows on the employee satisfaction surveys this year, the executive leadership team has made no positive changes. \r\n\r\nTo conclude: if you're looking for a DMH-agency mental health position, you're going to find the same challenges wherever you go (mismanagement, excessive and repetitive paperwork, and an emphasis on billing at the expense of any semblance of self-care). At this large agency, you might find a job that will get you hours towards licensure and benefits. You'll also feel inspired to serve kids who are resilient despite incredible adversity. But you will not be supported, and your quality of life will be very poor, particularly if you are not working in one of the few programs with consistent working hours. \r\n\r\nWonderful people are drawn to this kind of work, and I enjoyed most of my coworkers immensely.

The last two years had very poor employee satisfaction surveys which enrages and confuses senior management. Instead of figuring out core issues, or have some self-reflection, the senior staff become defensive and completely ignite the issues.  Retention rate among clinicians is atrocious, most leaving after a couple of years. For those interested in a clinical supervisor position: not only are you responsible for supervising 6-8 staff, but the last two years they have forced productivity expectations for this position of 3-5 hours a week to \u201chelp\u201d the bottom line.   You will also have to clean up charts, cover and open cases and train  more than in comparable agencies because of the turn-over rate.  You will also be on call and will have to train to be an LPS even if your primary programs are non-intensive.  Your role is that of plantation foreman, not trainer or mentor.   There is also different treatment according to what site you work for, divided by which Senior Vice-President oversees your site. Let\u2019s just say one team has more promotions, better compensation and less punitive measures than the other and better retention among middle management.
