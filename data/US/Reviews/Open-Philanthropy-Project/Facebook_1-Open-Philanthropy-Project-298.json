I think it\u2019s rare to find all three of these traits shared by the majority of staff, but Open Phil seems to have attracted/selected for these kinds of people. \r\n\r\nPolicies - Everything from new hire onboarding and the knowledge management system to expense reimbursement policy and quarterly co-working weeks feels efficient and non-bureaucratic.
