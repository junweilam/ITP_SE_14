In recent years, Landesa had a leadership transition from its founder to his protege and the organization grew very large very quickly. In the rush for growth, there was little time to invest in infrastructure or sort out whether job descriptions made sense or were redundant. This led to confusion at best, and employees finding their jobs were not at all what they were promised at worst. Many of Landesa's existing staff were pushed out or demoted into the far corners of the office to make room for new employees with impressive pedigrees. Because of this rapid growth, turnover has been high, and the culture at Landesa has changed dramatically for the worse. The hierarchy and bureaucracy can be maddening. During my last year at Landesa, I regularly had employees in tears in my office threatening to quit on a weekly basis. \r\n\r\nThe most frequent complaint at Landesa is that leadership does not invest in its employees. People come to Landesa with incredibly rich backgrounds and skill sets and are asked to file papers and proofread. If they are given substantial work, they almost never receive the credit.\r\n\r\nLeadership and staff have become increasingly faith-based, which has also shifted the culture. \r\n\r\nJust because the organization has a great mission, do not assume that all employees are there for the mission. Some are ruthless in climbing to the top, and this behavior is rewarded so long as it gets results.\r\n\r\nIt's a challenging environment to work in.

It\u2019s too bad, because a healthy and productive environment seems within reach. Landesa has most of the right ingredients. It\u2019s just a couple persistently rotten ones that hold it back. One is a couple departments or higher-level people that lack either the competence to do essential work at the right level and don\u2019t have the staff\u2019s confidence, or that don\u2019t have the right disposition and outlook for the global development sector. Another thing that\u2019s harder to pinpoint is a general inability to live out the organization\u2019s values and the culture that it wants. Take the example of wanting to have an environment where accomplishments are recognized and staff feel valued, something that has come up in organizational feedback. Instead of just being that way, which requires managers and others to simply be the type to call things out, take the time to say a few authentic words, or clearly tie performance to advancement, Landesa will do something like establish some awkwardly contrived minutes at every staff meeting where staff are put on the spot and have to come up with praise for someone else. Even in this exercise, you rarely see things coming from the top. Day to day in normal interactions, non-senior staff get this stuff. The miss is coming from above where tone setting could happen. It seems to not be in people\u2019s personalities organically (whether it\u2019s for this example or for having open discussion, communicating effectively, creating accountability, whatever), and the repeated inability to get the values stuff right might simply come down to that.\r\n\r\nIt seems difficult for some people to grow at Landesa and it's contributed to some departures. The staffing setup is such that most managers have far too many responsibilities on their plate to mentor or track anyone. And or they are not specifically accountable to the organization for doing it, so it does not happen.\r\n\r\nThere is generally not a climate for robust intellectual discussion and exploration. Busyness seems like a factor, but that can\u2019t be it.
