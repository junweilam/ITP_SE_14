The organization is disorganized and chaotic. The CEO is also very incompetent and makes many decisions driven by his ego, which makes the place really toxic. All decisions are driven by personal nonsense rather than the best interests of the organization, the staff, and the community it says it is about. For example, the organization recently returned to its inferior resource platform. It's poorly designed and much more challenging to use than the competition without even a 1/10 of the functionality."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Volunteer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly employees, positive environment and meaningful work", "cons": "None that I can think of"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Summer Intern", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Intern", "job_date": "6 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Intern", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great group of people that are dedicated to making an impact in local communities through the use of technology.", "cons": "It is a small group, meaning things can be hectic at times when deadlines and expansions are near."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "This is a great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is mission-aligned and ready to do the work.", "cons": "I can't think of any cons."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Warm and Lovely Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working hours\r\nNice working environment \r\nGood communication between employees and employer", "cons": "For the time being, no comments yet."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Mission Driven", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team and everyone aligned on mission to help underserved individuals find community resources", "cons": "can't think of any now"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "I worked at Onedegree full-time", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Oct 2019", "job_title": "UI/User Experience Designer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you want to learn, this is the place.", "cons": "There is no work flow in team."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Nice people", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Resource Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice team members and making a difference", "cons": "None at all.
