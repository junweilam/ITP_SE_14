Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable. It\u2019s a great place to learn from some of the best about ocean conservation and policy advocacy. \n\u2022\tDepending on your team, there is quite a bit of flexibility for staff to learn new skills. There are also amazing opportunities to attend interesting conferences, meet and work with staff from different international offices, or take professional development classes.\n\u2022\tIts fun! The work is interesting and so are your coworkers.", "cons": "\u2022\tThe opportunities listed above are not necessarily distributed evenly. An individual's opportunity to take advantage of these things often depends on their own awareness/initiative and their supervisor. \n\u2022\tThere is a severe lack of transparency around decision making in the organization. It\u2019s unclear to staff why people at the same level across the organization are paid different salaries. If you want a promotion or raise, you must go through an exhausting process \u2013 lasting up to six months \u2013 where you are given inconsistent reasons as to why the organizations cannot pay you what you are asking. There have been many examples where some staff were told that what they were asking for was outside of their respective pay bands, while other staff pushing for the same position were told that there were no pay bands. Executive-level staff have even admitted that they do not understand how resources are allocated when it comes to these budgetary decisions.\n\u2022\tThere is no tangible commitment to values that executive leadership claim to care about. The first value is sustainability. Over my time there I watched passionate staff advocate for more sustainable office practices only to be consistently denied even an ear on the topic. The second and most notable are issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Staff formed an interdisciplinary grassroots group in 2019 to discuss DEI issues within the organization, and generated positive momentum. However, once specific recommendations were shared with leadership, this momentum stalled. Executive leadership have chalked this up to HR not having the time to follow through on these recommendations, but they also haven\u2019t prioritized building the team\u2019s capacity to increase their bandwidth. Another example is ethics. Oceana has an ethics statement that staff are required to agree to when they are hired. One of the sections, which is typical in many organizations, is related to nepotism. During my time, there were at least four instances of children of donors, executive leadership, or board members given temporary or permanent positions. Multiple staff sent in anonymous complaints regarding some of these positions, only to receive copy and pasted responses that didn\u2019t always align with the complaint they even sent in. \n\u2022\t The structure of the organization doesn\u2019t seem to match its growth and operations. The CEO and President are too involved in day-to-day tasks and, as far as staff can tell, have not developed any long-term strategic plan or vision for the organization. There is no clear structure or project management system in place to coordinate multinational or cross-cutting initiatives, which is becoming an increasing proportion of Oceana\u2019s work. The current organizational structure likely served well when Oceana was a smaller organization roughly 10 years ago, but now it seems to hinder rather than support the existing growth. \n\n\nIndividually, these challenges are not dealbreakers. Collectively, though, they compound. For example, the lack of transparency in decision making (especially around pay) makes it difficult for staff with less financial means to take or keep a job with Oceana, since there is no clear understanding of your future pay prospects. Retention in the organization is poor within certain teams, and especially in the mid to early career individuals. Things are certainly better now than when I started, but the pace is glacial and there was no sign that leadership was planning to actually invest (as in with budget, full time staff, and the humility it takes to relinquish some control) in fixing some of these problems. Perhaps most concerning is that HR has been made aware of all these issues, whether through anonymous complaints via the EthicsPoint platform, in exit interviews, or through specific, direct feedback from both current and former employees. It\u2019s unclear if HR takes these complaints to senior leadership or not, but either way the improvement is happening too slowly. Even with the improvements, it all felt reactionary rather than proactive which is particularly frustrating for an organization that advocates against that exact behavior from national governments that refuse to sustainably manage their natural resources."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Digital Writer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good people at lower levels", "cons": "management is awful, very cliquey, and also not smart"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Campaigner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strategic, goal-oriented, organization that makes a real impact on the issues it focuses on.

Secrecy between departments is encouraged vs diplomacy. This leads to poor project management, metrics management, and individual needs of staff to be taken care of. The CEO and C-Suite does not update staff on the strategic plan of the organization \u2013 instead they spend their time telling staff how wonderful the board members are. Not only does this harm strategic planning and individual roles it also harms the work life of staff who are left in the dark and pitted against each other.\r\n\r\n-Lack of vision\r\nOn the surface Oceana has a good mission. Implementation and pathways to achieve that mission are horrible.  The organization is stagnant. From the director level and up there are individuals who have been promoted beyond their capabilities or have stayed too long without updating their playbook to achieve results. The organization is so risk adverse that any new idea, particularly from someone young, is immediately looked upon as a risk not worth taking. Oceana\u2019s campaigns are similar to others in the conservation space, yet others are outstripping Oceana in results on the local and national/international levels they work because they bring in a diverse workforce and ask diverse stakeholders to participate in saving the oceans and the natural world.  Oceana hasn\u2019t fully won any of its campaigns in years without the help on the ground of their competitors. To win a victory by themselves would mean they took a risk and going it alone and making waves would be too risky. \r\n\r\n-High turnover\r\nOceana is not so small of an organization that upward mobility shouldn\u2019t be a possibility for junior staff.   Staff leave for one of two reasons: no promotional opportunity or frustration with management (comms, strategy, not staying true to the mission). \r\n\r\n-Dated Professional knowledge, lack of investment in professional development\r\nIt\u2019s possible to stay in a role for 5+ years and still be good at your job. Not true at Oceana. Most of Oceana\u2019s upper management have been at the organization since it was in its infancy and have failed to remain knowledgeable about the competitive landscape. Others were promoted quickly and beyond their capacity have the privilege of staying in the roles, not meeting goals and having no consequences taken. The only real thing I learned here was that I had more knowledge than my supervisor and to put out dumpster fires caused by the supervisor between they spread to the team or harmed already weak inter departmental relationships.\r\n\r\n-Board\r\nCatering to the board is one thing but allow them to abuse the organization as a showcase in philanthropy to their friends and making it some feel good club where they can go out and eat shark fin soup and climb Machu Pichu isn\u2019t worth the hassle. The board has failed to truly analyze the status of the organization. If they were then they would realize facts and figures are manipulated for their eyes for example the high turnover rate\r\n\r\n-Favoritism\r\nIf a VP loves you, you can hide behind them and have your failures go unnoticed and blame your junior staff for wrongdoings.

Additionally, there is a sense that no one can do anything well, and that everything has to go through an exhaustive review.n. This cumbersome approach to management necessarily means that this once bold and original organization is now bloated and cumbersome. No one can show initiative; no one can move quickly. The layers of approval are endless and it leaves employees deflated. \r\n\r\nThe executive team is secretive. Weekly meetings are held between all members of the executive team but staff members do not receive any kind of updates and the lack of communication within the organization will ultimately be a fatal flaw. There is no employee newsletter, nor any way of learning what one's colleagues are working on, making it impossible to be abreast of the strategies and priorities. This is really a problem as the priorities change as the money flows, and the focus that once was the strength or Oceana has been diluted by the opportunity to get money.\r\n\r\nFinally, this place is a man's world. There is an undercurrent of sexism that I have never experienced anywhere else in the workplace. The CEO is pedantic and sexist as is the president.

The general vibe is that you'e always not working hard enough. \r\n\r\nOffice moral in headquarters is very low. HR is helpful, but problems are never actually solved, especially pervasive problems with poor upper-level management. That being said, lower-level staff are incredibly supportive of one another, and they make the job tolerable day to day. \r\n\r\nLeadership often changes priorities of staff, either because of requests from wealthy donors or board members (mostly wealthy donors). I agree with other reviewers that the organization needs to hire more people to deal with these random requests or start standing up for their staff and protecting staff's ability to do heir jobs. \r\n\r\nThe CEO is a smart man, but has blind spots when it come to extremely ineffective and universally disliked upper level management. Dysfunctional VPs drag their whole departments down, making it actively difficult for employees to do their jobs well. Upper level management does not trust the expertise of their employees. Employees often feel that when they do their job well, they are either punished by threatened management or are rewarded by more work that does not contribute to their goals. Additionally, very little consideration is given to career advancement, goals, or professional development, especially for younger workers. \r\n\r\nNot surprising, turnover is extremely high in many departments, even for nonprofits."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sustainability In Our Oceans, But Not In This Company", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Oceana is seemingly a great place to work.
