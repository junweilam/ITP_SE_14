Lack of downward communication from senior management on organizational goals and priorities unless your part of the senior leadership club.  Lack of clear vision on new business development and bizarre allocation of financial resources by the incoming CEO directed toward hiring more executives, most of whom are friends and former colleagues from the past.  Weak project management system led by even weaker managers which is resulting large scale failures within existing programs and creating challenges on the financial management side as well.  You will likely be reading about them in the news like the former AED at some point in the near future.  There has been little if any interest in developing leadership within the organization and as a result the brightest young minds are leaving while the few good managers are also on their way out.  This used to be an amazing place for young people that were hungry and wanting to learn the business while working in a truly mission driven environment but for them it's little more than a sweatshop now with it's only real value is the brand they can use to market themselves to other organizations.  Sadly that brand is also dissolving.  They are still reeling from a 20% reduction in staff a  year ago and it sounds like another, though smaller may be in the works now."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "True professionals", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Oct 2014", "job_title": "M&E Specialist in Bishkek", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Compared to most local organizations, the company pays higher", "cons": "in the head-office, perhaps, the staff is employed for a long-term, but as for staff in the field, the project that i am working with is a 3-year project, and staff are hired for a short-term."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "medicore", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Travel for junior staff; nice, friendly, staff", "cons": "New project support management structure has some kinks to work out.
