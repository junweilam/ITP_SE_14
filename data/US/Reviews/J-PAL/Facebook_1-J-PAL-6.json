The general structure of the organization is extremely exploitative and PIs get much more from the experience than RAs. Despite the fact that the RAs are literally indispensable for the research they are literally relegated to a footnote in the paper. In truth RAs bring more value to the research than the PIs. The worst part is that that RAs take this exploitation with the hope that their PIs will give them rla recommendation letter for grad school in the US. Sadly these letters are not as forthcoming as RAs initially expect. To think that students in the US can get the same letters simply for doing well in the professors class, a class that meets two times a week for an hour and a half is a level of unfairness that is truly disgusting. I am the only person I am aware of from my time at JPAL that ever ended up in a top notch PhD program in the USA, out of almost 10 to 15 close friends who were RAs at the time.
