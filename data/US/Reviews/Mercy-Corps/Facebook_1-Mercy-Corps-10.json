At the top, there seem to be some serious egos fighting for legacy points instead of helping the org run better. \r\n\r\nI worked at Mercy Corps for more than 5 years, and a few years ago I would have given it a solid 4 stars. Now, the place is a disaster and causing many people to have unhealthy levels of workplace-related stress, which is ultimately why I left.\r\n\r\nMy experience was that expertise is not valued unless you are in the top rung boy\u2019s club or have ingratiated yourself with someone in that club. \r\n\r\nCurrent leadership of the marketing/fundraising department seemed to be hand-picked by the CEO and yet has no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t seem to like or respect fundraising, which they oversee. They also do not listen to the people they manage who DO have experience and expertise. \r\n\r\nPeople now have to work on a strategy that they know will not work for fundraising. Countless people have tried to educate leadership about what works and what the potential risks/consequences are of trying something completely different with no data or evidence to back it up. Instead of adjusting the strategy OR adjusting fundraising goals to account for the risk of trying something new, people are being held to even higher standards than before, with no realistic way of meeting those goals. This means that people can\u2019t do their best work because of leadership mandates and are doomed to fail. This is hugely demoralizing. \r\n\r\nLeadership has created a toxic no feedback culture. They say they want feedback, but data and best practices are constantly ignored in preference of \u201cgut feelings,\u201d and people who challenge or question leadership in any way are branded as negative people who don\u2019t see the vision. I\u2019ve seen those people, who I believe are asking those questions to make the org better, be dismissed and then excluded from key conversations because they spoke up. \r\n\r\nThe wrong people succeed. I\u2019ve seen critical and high performing employees be laid off for reasons that seem suspicious at best, and others be demoted despite being universally beloved and hitting their goals. All the while, people who are friends with leadership keep climbing the ladder and those same people then hire their friends, whether they are qualified or not, or agencies they prefer without going through any RFP process. People who\u2019ve made it into what I think of as \u2018the club\u2019 have VP level roles created for them out of thin air, whether they are necessary or not. \r\n\r\nThere are no checks and balances. Valid and detailed complaints about these issues (and more) have been filed with HR with absolutely no recourse or consequences that I can tell. The upper rungs of the org can seemingly do no wrong. I personally lost faith in HR and leadership because of this, and I know I\u2019m not the only one.\r\n\r\nMany of these issues have been going on for a year or longer with no consequences. I and many others stuck it out for quite a while in the hopes that something would get better, that people would start listening, etc. But leadership doesn\u2019t seem bothered by the extremely low morale and loss of many longtime employees. \r\n\r\nI am genuinely concerned about the future of the org. There seems to be reckless spending happening, all while a few people tell large groups of talented fundraisers to do things that go against best practice and internal historical knowledge and expertise. I would not be surprised to see many more people leave and possibly more layoffs due to low fundraising numbers caused by these new mandates strategies. \r\n\r\nI did not want to leave Mercy Corps. I truly loved my role there and I wanted to stay for 5+ more years. I loved my team like a family. But the stress, low morale and unreachable goals created by poor leadership was just too much after a year of dealing with the worst of it. I know my departure was a loss to the organization in terms of experience and historical knowledge - a loss that will sadly mostly be felt by colleagues I adored.
