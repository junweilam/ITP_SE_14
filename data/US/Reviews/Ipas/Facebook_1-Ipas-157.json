I'm yet to meet a black person who feels/felt welcome and aporeciated. To call it as it is, this organization suffers from a good measure of white supremacy - in terms of race, ideals, and ideas. A lot of incrimination that is simply ignored. And what the hell is HR's work? Just hire and fire and dish out unnecessary PIPs as directed by the chosen few? How bizarre?  What's even more unfortunate is that the chosen few are so stuck in their privilage that they actually don't realize how hateful and hurtful they are to others. The culture here is - the more big/technical words you get out of your mouth, the more you are celebrated by the powers that be. This has led to people being placed in managerial positions with zero leadership skills, distressing those who report to them. Come on now, we all know that big words really mean nothing to the woman and girl in a deep rural village where we work. Favoritism is also rampant! As long as you are in the chosen few club, management will do anything they can to accommodate you. Poor performance....no problem! You will get a second, third, fourth chance. You will actually be moved to another position. Not in the club? ....you are automatically placed on the so called performance improvement plan - just as a way of signaling your way out. So, one must chose between staying until they're shown the door or leaving on their own before it comes.
