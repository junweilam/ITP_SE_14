During your first few months of hiring, you will notice that either you or one of your team members will be asked to step in to support work within your field in another country office or region, without receiving any compensation or allowance, and cutting time to 50% on your current workload. This is due to the lack of funding, they do not have money to employ enough people so they dump all work on very few people, an extremely common practice within all departments at the organization. You will agree to the arrangement so you can look good in front of your supervisor and other team members and hope for a huge raise when the time comes but trust me, you're not getting anything neither will it aid you in any way during your time at search, this will only be an irritating disturbance that gets in your way of handling your already full plate of designated tasks. You will also start to realize with time that you're working on behalf of your team members, since they were hired based on connections and don't know how to complete their tasks. You will notice that some managers are tight knit with some employees, due to them knowing each other previously and have employed each other unethically. It will be difficult for you to bring up any issues since these employees will defend each other and will only point their fingers back at you. If you do, your name will be shared with some \"concerns\" about you and how you're suddenly not needed/wanted anymore within the team. To add to the inconvenience, you will also find it difficult to track when you would actually be paid if you work at any of the field offices, since pay is usually late, and varies from month to month, so you need to make sure you prepare for a late paycheck. Now, when the time comes for the annual job performance evaluation, you might be surprised that your team members who do nothing and are on performance improvement plans have scored the same as you, a person who at the least performs their daily objectives and has career plans. This is due to an unfair grading system shared among all employees which only allows for a certain percentage range increases on your current salary, in which most people score poorly due to their supervisors not liking them. To give you a little insight as to who gets the highest percentage, I would have to get into how some junior unskilled, untutored, pretty faces are getting senior positions on very little years of experience, and I will leave it to your imagination as to how they do.\r\nThese raises leave these functionally illiterate employees at the top of the scale in terms of pay, higher than some of the major managers within the teams. I should also point out that I have never witnessed more sexual misconduct talks within one place of work in my entire life, and honestly along with the rest of what was shared within this review( you can look at the rest of the reviews as well, we're all telling you this is just not it) , do you really want to work here?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A",

The organization\u2019s institutional memory and expertise in peacebuilding is nearly 40 years rich, and its willingness to innovate in some of the world\u2019s seemingly intractable conflicts, even before peacebuilding was even a field, is impressive.", "cons": "Search suffers from chronic dysfunction at multiple levels, ranging from financial non-compliance (and even corruption in some cases), to crippling debt, a constantly shifting senior management structure, decrepit office spaces, and a lack of good systems and processes across the board. The organization has been teetering on the edge of financial insolvency for years and is only being kept on life support thanks to millions of dollars in donations by Board members. Only recently has a bank been confident enough to offer the organization a line of credit.\r\n\r\nSearch relies heavily on entry- and mid-level staff, yet barely pays its headquarters employees enough to survive DC's high cost of living, which is 60% higher than the rest of the country. When adjusted for cost of living, an associate-level employee at Search makes the equivalent of $19,000/year, with managers making only a little more. HR has promised that salaries have been benchmarked to industry rates, and yet those rates are kept behind closed doors. Some deeper research, however, reveals that the majority of lower- and mid-level positions are being paid $10,000-30,000 less/year than at comparable peer organizations, which means the benchmarks are being low-balled or perhaps disregarded altogether. At the same time, staff at the Director level and above earn in the solid six figures, which depletes lean budgets and leaves little left to compensate lower-level staff fairly. Senior staff regularly charge their time to non-compliant budget lines because their salary level cannot be absorbed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSearch has laid out a bold strategic plan that includes targeting some of the most fragile and insecure conflict geographies. While this strategy is laudable, decisions to work in certain dangerous and volatile areas have been made over-confidently and ad hoc without a full assessment of risks or a clear security plan. Doing so severely jeopardizes staff safety on the ground.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has been at Search long enough will tell you that there is a clear and consistent pattern in the organization\u2019s dysfunction. At least once per year, the organization hits a crisis point that will send leadership scrambling for solutions and assurances. A plan will be developed\u2014whether firing new executives, acquiring new software, re-envisioning departments and roles, implementing new protocols, or setting organization-wide strategic objectives\u2014and yet time and again these new measures fall flat on their face and roll straight into the next crisis point. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, but turnover within the organization and on the Board of Directors, along with \u201ctalking a big talk\u201d to peers and donors, keeps true accountability from being achieved. It\u2019s a constant carrot on a stick that makes the organization feel incredibly fragile and on the edge of collapse."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Very bad management at the top level", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Program Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work done by the field teams who are the core of the organisation.

Their mission is fantastic and vital to changing the world. The opportunity to contribute to that mission is very special. The majority of the people who work at Search are the most wonderful people I've ever met. The majority of middle-management are wonderful and qualified leaders who deeply care about their colleagues. The opportunities to meet amazing people from all around the world and learn from them is both inspiring and a wonderful perk to the job. \r\n\r\nOverall, Search is a great place to work if you have enough money already to live. However, if you are just starting your career, do not expect a livable wage. You must also plan your life around Search so if you do not have many non-work obligations, Search is the place for you. If you are looking to join as an entry level employee or desire some form of rational work-life balance, I would not recommend Search.\r\n\r\nOne last thing: While there have is little positive to say about most of the upper-leadership at Search, there are also many leaders who really do care about and fight for their employees. They deserve an incredible amount of praise. And there are other leaders who are are so busy, so overwhelmed by their enormous mandate that they do not see what really goes on. Forgive them for they know not what they've done. In the case of Search, a few bad apples do really spoil the whole bunch.", "cons": "There are many cons to working at Search, especially at the lower levels of the latter. The first is that nobody, especially leadership, is held accountable for mistakes or misconduct. Most of upper-management has been at Search for many years. For that very reason, and because they are viewed as indispensable,  they are permitted to say and act in any way they wish with little consequence. I personally received emails from colleagues that went beyond professional criticism and ventured into personal attacks. I have experienced and witnessed upper-level managers say things that are totally out of line to employees. Leadership, additionally, has no sense of boundaries. There is a lack of respect for peoples time. While most matters are not urgent, the higher-ups feel compelled to call, email, text, or Slack at any point, with the expectation that one should drop their lives to tend to their needs. There is a tacit expectation that you are on-call at all times. Finally, overall, leadership fails to celebrate achievements but instead always finds ways of criticizing. Nothing is ever enough. And when you do something well, they are more than happy to take the credit for it!\r\n\r\nMoving back to accountability, most egregious is the fact that I personal experienced personal, not professional, criticism from upper-level managers but when reported, there were no consequences. One executive called me into his office to tell me how I would never amount to anything and that it was a mistake to hire me. This seemly came out of the blue and was right before Christmas. The meeting was also called under the guise that he wanted to know MY aspirations. While this leader is no longer with Search, most in power were not phased when I shared this with them. By the way, that was my THIRD WEEK. Another longtime executive once patted my stomach in the elevator and suggested that I should take the stairs. When I raised this to HR several times, the best they could do was nod their head with an un-surprised look. This is what I mean by a lack of accountability. Longtime leaders are viewed as so indispensable that they can get away with anything. The majority of employees are left to suffer under this bad leadership. Believe though, there is hell to pay for much less egregious professional or personal transgressions if you sit lower on the totem pole (not from HR but likely from these very leaders); if you are one of the have-nots. \r\n\r\nThis too seeps into another example of Search's hypocrisy.   While some leaders are viewed as indispensable, many longtime and dedicated employees just under that level are suddenly fired. One day all is well, the next thing they know, this is there last week. These are employees who have dedicated their lives to this organization and are sent away in the most undignified fashion. But Search's biggest hypocrisy is that as a whole, the leadership does not live the mission and values that they preach. They preach empathy and yet many senior leaders are wildly not empathetic. They preach the importance of having everyone's voice heard yet they exclude many employees from important decisions that affect their lives and work. They preach accountability and yet there is only accountability for those who are not the chosen ones. Employees are constantly implored to live the values and mission, to be so dedicated that life should become work. Some senior leaders even describe it positively as cultish. Yet there is no reward to the many employees that do try to live the organization's values and in fact, are sometimes chastised for doing so.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the culture is just awful. While many lower and mid-level employees are very supportive of each other, the necessity to comes from working in a terrible environment. Comradely is often bred from common misery. Nobody takes a minute to breathe, most eat lunch every day in front of their computers. Most come in before 9 and stay way after 5, in addition to working weekends. And while leadership is \"committed\" to not making this the norm, it is and leadership has done more to reinforce this than change it. Though one might say, \"you do not have to answer emails after hours or on vacation,\" because everyone else is, it becomes the tacit expectation. As one leader once summed it up, to paraphrase, \"work-life balance is not real.\"\r\n\r\nAll of this would be fine if I had been paid a livable wage. All this would be fine if MOST employees were paid a livable wage. I gave this job all I had and still couldn't pay my rent. That is not right. And when I asked for a reasonable salary, nothing over the top, I received very discouraging answers. I made my needs very clear but it seemed that the higher-ups were more than happy to let me walk than be open to getting me to a point where I could simply live. This would be fine if there was some standardization among how people are paid. Instead, wages vary for employees on the same level, seemly at random. The criteria for salary changes depending on who you ask. Some say a Masters degree matters and others say it does not. Some say that the time you've worked there matters or your previous experience matters until someone with much less experience gets hired at your level for much higher pay. None of this would matter if I or many of my former colleagues saw a clear way forward, a way to grow, move up the latter, and become a better professional. But there is no clear path. Everything is stagnate. While there is always a promise of professional development, leadership fails to come through. At Search for Common Ground, there are the haves and the have-nots. If you are a have, you still have to fight for every promotion, raise, etc. but you do eventually get it. If you have a have-not, its either deal or leave. And if you leave, they are more than happy to replace you with someone even cheaper.\r\n\r\nWorking at Search is emotionally taxing. Slowly one's raison d'etre slowly deteriorates. One wakes up in the middle of the night asking if anything they do matters, if anyone cares, if they are just wasting their time in the pursuit of a better world? As many beams of light try to penetrate, one becomes eaten by the darkness and negativity that is the work environment at Search. While many wonderful colleagues take the time to get to know you, to help you grow, to take the time and hear your concerns, to comfort you in times of need, it is so often drowned out by the darkness cast by the people with the power. For all the inspiring people and stories one comes across, they can only serve as fuel for so long when one is constantly drained by everything else around them."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Intern", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Positive work environment!
