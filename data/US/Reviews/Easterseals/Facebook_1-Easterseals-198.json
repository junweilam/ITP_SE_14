I was asked to come in early, give up shifts, take overtime, etc. CONSTANTLY. This was not a full-time job where I could expect a stable income. I had management call me and cancel my shifts less than 12 hours before I was supposed to be there multiple times. I budgeted on working that shift and getting that pay but I got nothing. I also have multiple times shown up to shifts to work with clients and nobody is home and I call the \"on-call\" and they tell me to go home because they forgot to tell me the client didn't need services today. Even though I spent 30 mins driving to the site and drove 20 miles, Easterseals refused to reimburse me for any of that. Not only did I waste my time and my gas, but I also was expecting to be paid for that shift and there was never an opportunity to make up that money.\r\n\r\nEasterseals will nickel-and-dime you for EVERYTHING. Easterseals management will make a mistake and expect you to pocket the expense. Easterseals will forgo your bonuses and forgo your raises because of a new project they are working on. Meanwhile, Easterseals is sending you an email almost weekly bragging about another tens of thousands of dollar donation they received. To make matters worse, Easterseals will hound you about donating to their mission (20 dollars or more is recommended). As an employee in an industry where people make 12-15 an hour, I am not volunteering my time or donating more than my hourly pay.\r\n\r\nWhile working at Easterseals, I received the bare minimum in training. Once I subbed at a site that needed a staff and Easterseals gave me two hours of training before they left me on the cite alone. It was HELL. The clients had to teach me how to do their care routines and I was so stressed but was told to suck it up because it was an \"emergency.\" This was so unsafe. It makes me wonder why Easterseals is always bragging about opening new cites when they consistently have to pull staff who are not trained to work at other houses. Similarly, I always worked the morning shift at a house and was asked to stay and work the evening shift as well. I told management I didn't feel comfortable because I had never been taught or shown how to put the clients to bed. Management told me to ask the client and the clients would teach me how to do it. How can Easterseals claim to be client focused when they are failing to train staff on how to take care of the clients.\r\n\r\nThroughout my time at Easterseals, there was only one time the management ever came to the 24 hour houses I worked at. Many of the clients at the 24-hour houses would complain about the management failing to actually implement the care plans made by the case managers. Managers would rather 24-hour staff leave the houses and put the clients on alone time so the staff can go pick up cleaning supplies, masks, technology, etc. from the office then the managers step foot outside the office and bring those necessary items to the sites. Multiple times I had to leave clients who could not use the bathroom independently alone for 30+ mins because the managers didn't want to visit the 24-hour houses to drop off needed supplies. It is obvious the managers put their comfort above the quality of life for many of these clients.\r\n\r\nOverall, based on my experience, I do not recommend that anyone place there loved-one in an Easterseals home. There are multiple other companies that are more competent and actually train their employees. Many other companies take their responsibilities as a company to provide care seriously, but from my experience, Easterseals does not."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good experience but wouldn\u2019t stay long due to burnout", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Paid pretty well, met some cool people, cared about employees to ask what incentives they wanted", "cons": "Burn out city.

However, it can be very rewarding depending on your level of patience and love for the job. The upside to this job is that there is always opportunities to move up, but it will require a Master's degree for certain positions like a Program Manager or Clinical Supervisor. During the pandemic, Easterseals in my opinion really took care of their employees in terms of compensation, safety, and updates. In addition, being assigned to a clinical team makes the job of a BI easier and more efficient; it also makes it a little bit more intimate (so it's not intimidating to seek for help & support when/if needed). Overall, it's a good job, especially if you are curious about the ABA field. It's challenging, but extremely rewarding.", "cons": "The downside of working as a Behavioral Interventionist (BI) (at least in Easterseals) is that it can be extremely overwhelming. The families you would be assigned to can sometimes be draining. The cases can be emotionally tiring. The drive especially can be dreadful. Saying all this also if you are not really into the job to begin with (yes you will feel those things regardless if you love the job or not \u2014 but you would definitely feel it more if you don't). As a BI, this job is actually rewarding in a way that your hard work many times can be seen in the progress of the client you're working with and the smiles and excitement of the families when progress is seen. Something to consider also is that this job requires major flexibility with your time; this is something that took me a while to get used to because when your prime case is cancelled for the day, it will be expected that you will make up that time either that same day or another day with another case (sometimes new). Sometimes it may feel like your time isn't yours due to scheduling flexibility to move you around whenever and wherever. Again, this is something I had to get used to coming from a working environment that was a little bit more consistent on a day-to-day basis. In addition, it takes a while for a schedule change to process, which is a big deal if you're a student and or if life just happens.

You are enticed to the position with a good per hour salary and hopes of becoming full-time but it never happens and if it does it is never for long. \r\n\r\nAt any moment your case load can drop for any reason and you will just be out of luck and expected to be on-call all day waiting to fill in for other Interventionists as a substitute which most people hate to do. You literally get a call and have to go to someone's home that you have never been to and see a child who is most likely triggered by changes to a daily routine and wing-it. These children do not like substitutes most of the time which makes it more likely for you to get hit or look like a fool for 2, 3, or even 4 hours as they cower in the corner trying to get away from you. Parents usually dislike this too and are quick to let you know. You are expected to do this at the drop of a dime to earn money or you don't get paid. Not to mention sometimes these kids are over an hour away. Even when it is not in the best interest of the child to see a substitute you are expected to do it because it brings in money and they can bill for it. Excuses are made such as it is great for generalizing when in reality half the time you are entertainment, a babysitter or the kid's worst nightmare when you substitute.\r\n\r\nBehavior Interventionists get the short end of every stick and do the most work. They do the most driving per day (sometimes over 100 miles), they see the clients and parents the most, enter all the data, take all the data, make the materials and are expected to live up to insane standards under crazy situations. Sad to say it but a lot of the times the children hit, curse, want you to leave and parents talk to you like absolute trash all day. When you report it back nothing is done. Parents can continue the next day as you sit in their house being hit by their child. \r\n\r\nIt seems to come down to BI's being the breadwinners for the company. BI's are expected to earn all the money by seeing the clients and everyone else gets the pay from it. There are so many unnecessary jobs in administration or higher that get paid way too much money and never even see a kid in person. The top gets paid the most and it dwindles down to the BI's who basically get the scraps but are made to believe that they only deserve 18 bucks an hour for seeing the client when the actual sessions are being billed for hundreds. \r\n\r\nIf you want a job where you will drive tirelessly all day (wasting lots of gas), have no guaranteed hours (regardless of what they promise you), get physically and verbally abused all day (while being absolutely selfless), lots of work and little reward, be emotionally and financially drained and get little to no benefits this is the job for you. \r\nDoes that sound like a job you would like?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "direct support associate  for Easter Seals of New Hampshire", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Direct Support Associate in Stratham, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get the freedom to go out and have fun and educational within the bounds of yours and your client's interests.
