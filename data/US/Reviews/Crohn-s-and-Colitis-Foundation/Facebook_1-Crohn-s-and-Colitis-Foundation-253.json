HR and senior leadership know of the issues that have been officially reported, and nothing is done about it. Ask about the turnover, and don't listen to their excuses as to why (blaming it on other companies being able to pay more etc,). The bottom line is happy people don't quit. Period. Just focus on the numbers. If it is higher than the national average, there is a good reason for that. Numbers don't lie. DO NOT WORK HERE. You will be miserable. It is a horribly toxic work culture. Your health will suffer from the level of stress you will experience. You will be expected to do the work of 3 people because they can't keep staff due to the horrible senior leadership, and then you will be negatively reviewed for not doing more. Forget taking time off because coming back from PTO is so nasty that it's not worth doing. Your voice will not be heard if you try and complain to HR or anyone in the C-Suite. I wish I had listened to the bad reviews on here before accepting a position. Worst decision I've ever made in my professional career.

Promotions happen even if the staff member is not yet qualified for the position. This kind of decision-making perpetuates the cycle of bad management. Once promoted, new management does not receive training, nor do they have resources to turn to when a problem does arise. HR does not seem experienced enough, nor do they have the resources to be fully effective because they have a very small staff and are only located in the HQ office.\r\n\r\nPeople are worked hard, goals are almost always just above what is reasonable, and upper management thinks pushing harder is the way to motivate staff. Upper management is often out-of-state and because they are spread so thin rarely has time to strategize or get to know employees or their territory. Worse than out-of-state upper management is bad management at the chapter level. The review process for managers includes revenue benchmarks, but no standards for staff contentment.
