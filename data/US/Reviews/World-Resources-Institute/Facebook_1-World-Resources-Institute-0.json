I had multiple managers overseeing my work who were at different levels within the organization. The manager who had the highest role was in charge of all decisions. Everyone was too scared to stand up against this person because they were very rude and childish (cutting people off during meetings almost daily, telling people their ideas were bad without listening, ignoring things). When I was having serious issues with my managers due to behavior that is absolutely unacceptable at any workplace, I went to HR and they ended up ruining my life, going so far as to sabotage my chances with other jobs. To show you how bad it ended up being, I spoke with a lawyer and had legal grounds to sue WRI due to HR's incompetence, but the cost and energy involved in doing so made me not go through with it. In regular instances, I am weary of HR as they are in place to protect the organization. At WRI, going to HR is career suicide. You could have video evidence of harassment and they will do everything in their power to not only bury it, but to throw you under the bus so they do not have to take accountability for their wrongdoing. The entire HR department (especially those higher up) are a disgrace to the organization. \r\n\r\nI also watched another junior employee at WRI I worked with who was smart and hard-working be treated very badly and have HR screw them over with no way to stand up for themselves. If HR continues to be like this (glad that many other reviews on Glassdoor have similarly raised awareness on how bad HR was to them) then employees NEED a way to stand up for themselves. There are no checks and balances for power in this organization. After everything, I'm resigning in a few weeks and looking forward to it! Felt hesitant to say anything bad because I like to be cordial and maintain good relationships with all workplaces I leave.

WRI has had huge staff growth during the pandemic, but the systems and processes haven't been improved at the same rate, so everything takes much longer than it should. Operations, HR, and finance staff turnover has been very high as a result making every request and hiring process take 2-4X longer than it would normally leading to huge bandwidth constraint issues. This leads to teams regularly working overtime. Burnout isnt' as high as it would be in some corporate environments, but for a non-profit where you'd expect work-life balance, it occurs more frequently than it should. \r\n\r\nWRI also doesn't have clearly delineated decision-making processes and programs operate by consensus. This leads to highly inefficient systems where program leads spend way too much time discussing issues internally and not enough time trying to affect change externally. \r\n\r\nWRI's meeting culture is out of control - staff spend way too much time talking to each other and need to figure out a more sustainable and efficient way to navigate the pandemic that doesn't involve so many meetings.\r\n\r\nFinally, the business model needs significant improvements. WRI needs to diversify its revenue streams and do more to support program directors with fundraising, starting with how its rates are structured (see advice below)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Impact driven organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team, focus on impact", "cons": "Always fundraising, need more stability"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sad state of affairs", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 May 2022", "job_title": "Associate in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Only above average teammates looking to bring a difference", "cons": "This organization is gradually turning into hub of racism.
