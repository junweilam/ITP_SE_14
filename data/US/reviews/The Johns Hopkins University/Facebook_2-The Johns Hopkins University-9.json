Long -term staff employees seem over-medicated or in a daze and sadly, they begin counting years to retirement when they are barely 40 and have many years to go. Pay is not competitive, and JHU fully expects a 2yr revolving door for many employees; little or no effort to retain. In fact, they rather you leave so they can get fresh faces and pay them a pittance until they, in turn, leave. This is why JHU has such an entrenched reputation as a place to get on your resume and leave; it is very difficult to stay with rising living costs and virtually no raises, or a tiny token raise. JHU pretends to be broke when dealing with rank and file employees, though the money flows like a river to managers and pet projects.

Management pretends to care but they don't. I stuck it out as long as I could under this new guy but threw in the towel and quit. Looking back, I wish that I had taken the time to look elsewhere within the organization for a new position/role. But at the time, I was certain that it would be the same no matter what location/department I worked for, within the organization. Recently (2 years later) I applied and interviewed for another Financial Analyst role within Johns Hopkins University (completely different location/department) and was pleasantly surprised at what a positive impression I have. Hoping that the negative experience 2 years ago was just within that team/department/location, I guess we'll see.
