Flexibility regarding time and mobility in online education \u2013 and that's about it", "cons": "Very incompetent directors steal the show (aka 'riding the legacy train') and then abruptly leave JHU right in the middle of semesters - Faculty used to be open and more transparent to the student but now it feels very distant, even in their teaching practices, and this is already a remote program - Extremely flimsy MS degrees granted from a large named university (its definitely not a positive in industry and it can cause irreversible damage to your resume), the coursework is much lighter than it should be - No pressure applied by faculty but there is definitely dysfunction on JHU's end applied to an online graduate student - Some of the courses are downright subpar, even below community college level, and should be replaced - These same courses are taught by either very weak or very strong researchers who don't seem to like teaching but only enjoy taking the glory of adding JHU Faculty to their CV  \r\n\r\nMost AAP programs have little entrance standards so your classmates are a very wide, unpredictable mixture from the super incompetent and clueless student to the exceptionally talented student, which hurts the talented folks because the mess is dragged into the program - The programs demonstrate a let anyone in the door attitude and it reflects in the student body, the poor performance and laziness of several students, it tampers with the seriousness of better quality, motivated students, and this large overlap will eventually tarnish AAP's reputation if left in place - Students range from the MDs at a private medical practice, to the gasoline attendant at your local block, to active Assistant & Associate Professors, to the international students living in other countries who find AAP programs too easy and leave, to highly experienced Project Managers in major US corporations, and to the guy who cuts the lawns of those same US corporations each week (it really doesn't matter folks, AAP will take them all) - To me, the admission standards at AAP seems like: 'if you have money to burn, come join us because we will easily ignite it for you, with very miniscule benefit to you in return' - horrible, damaging, and completely unacceptable to students/professionals at all levels\r\n\r\nIncredibly high turnover in faculty members that are not announced (anymore) \u2013 this leads to a \"cheap educational\" feeling from students who are spending hard earned money on education that is driven by most faculty whom do not take AAP serious enough and then run off with a JHU Faculty Member line item on their resume - I noticed several students transferring from one AAP program to the next AAP program, just in search for a better education - Thanks to JHU AAP, the final transcript has almost half-dozen different names under 'Advisor' because the previous people left the university over a short period of time - Now the graduates are viewed as indecisive, unstable, and unpredictable in regards to working under approved faculty, which is entirely not the case but it sure looks like it to outside companies, trust me\r\n\r\nDo not interact with the IT department here \u2013 very poor quality people and even higher turnover, they pretend to help you and then report back bloated responses - Managers are immature, unprofessional and dirty - Engineers will just point out obvious problems, bicker and complain but they won't actually solve them - You are better off going to a close friend who works in the IT industry for legitimate, honest technical assistance because AAP's IT is a disgrace to the system\r\n\r\nThe coursework is entirely variable \u2013 its almost as if the faculty never talk to each other when building up courses in the programs - There is no cohesion between courses and no pattern to follow, as you are left with taking random courses per term - Its a large drawback for this method of education so be smart, stay away, and do not waste your money in online education here"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Johns Hopkins good overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Associate Director in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are excellent opportunities for research and great colleagues to work with.

Often times the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing. This became a troubling sign early on, as mid level managers who did not have the skills to work well with other employees were given tasks to train new employees. \nThere is a very high turnover rate that not a lot of people are willing to discuss.\nThe 120 day probationary period can be a bit excessive and not employee friendly. This is considering the fact that Hopkins benefits are not as competitive with other industries that have great vacation and PTO. \nBaltimore is a rough place to work and not welcoming to people who make life changes to be in the area. Between the crime that is constantly near campus, lack of emotional support, and little understanding from those who are employed from the outside, Hopkins is notorious for being in a declining city that has multiple problems. Employees get at least one email a day of an armed robbery near campus, students who get mugged on a walk back to their dorm, and bomb threats.\nIt is not uncommon to walk outside and find all the windows of the cars next to you busted and/or dented up. If you want parking that won\u2019t be in dangerous areas of the city, it will cost around $110 a month.\nTuition benefits are standard for employees. I personally have heard of universities that do more in the way of help for their staff though. My honest opinion, if you want to work in education and are pursuing a masters at the same time, Hopkins makes it extremely tough to go to school and work. I have interviewed multiple employees in their mid 20\u2019s who have tried to do both work and school through Hopkins and it led to them having to make a choice between the two. Lack of support between schooling and work is quite concerning for an institution that preached higher education. \n\nOverall: My suggestion is that if your younger, do not look at Johns Hopkins. Your much better being in a city like Washington DC, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, Austin where the pay is competitive and the benefits are very competitive. Baltimore is a rough city that has very little to offer. It just so happens that Hopkins is a super power in a city that really does not have much more to offer. \nThe high turnover rates and lack of diversity in staff comes at no surprise. 90% of the employees you will be working with are born and raised in the Baltimore region. Though the school preaches diversity in its student body, it could do more to follow with its back end staff. What I find interesting is the amount of Professors who are unwilling to live in the Baltimore area. Many times they are commenting from either DC or Philadelphia areas, where the job market and research can provide more opportunities for them."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent research institution.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 May 2014", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of great minds here.
