The campus had to make large layoffs in 2011 due to mismanagement of building projects and preventable water damage to facilities.  As a government agency with roughly 80% of expenses as salaries -- when there are budget over-runs, building damage, or project mismanagement - the results are layoffs (not of those mismanaging, but of faculty and staff).  Perhaps more concerning though is the open door policy of trying to recruit as many students as possible regardless of the potential for success.  Each term hundreds of new students are accepted and enrolled in remedial classes being coaxed with \"easy free money\" of student loans.  Unfortunately most drop out with major debt load before even completing a single course which might count toward a degree. A simple way to determine \"student success\" should be measured by how many students are admitted each term and how many students graduate each term; unfortunately there are few who make it all the way to graduation."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Place to Learn", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Saint Cloud, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to learn new skills you may not currently posses.
