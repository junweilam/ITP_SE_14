So that was a challenge to work through with both the athletic department and student-athletes 4) There were some challenges working collaboratively with the other coaches primarily the strength and conditioning coaches stemming from the culture of low performance and low expectations, the lead to the strength coaches not believing the athletic abilities of the student - athletes. Second, the strength and conditioning coaches were resistant to plan the strength training programs for the student - athletes and rarely communicated progress in strength training.
