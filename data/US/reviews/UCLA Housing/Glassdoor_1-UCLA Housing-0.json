Everyone is just trying to help each other get work done. - Great job if looking for stability.... so stable and stagnate that even your pay barely budges -Pension (if you are willing to devote your life to UC-system but note the severe opportunity cost of this as you can make so much more in the private sector.)", "cons": "- You will have two types of colleagues. Comrade-in-arms in suffering, the very definition of \"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK\". Or lazy coworkers who make your life more miserable and add to your workload. - Extremely low pay compared to market rates. Management will never give you for more than \"meets expectations\" in employee evaluations because if they do so, means you deserve a raise which requires approval from the top-echelons if the raise is 5% or more. Expect the only \"raises\" to receive your cost-of-living-adjustments. Management will try to convince you this is a raise. DO NOT BE FOOLED. When my job got unionized, it translated to the new \"career-paths\" pay scale which forced me up to the minimum scalling from 35% below market rate to 25%. I knew I was severely being underpaid but didn't realize how bad they were lowballing and only accepted this job in the first place a few years back due to health issues with immediate family members. All pay-data is public information so EVERYONE knows how much EVERYONE is making. - Commute is horrible. Expect to spend 2.5-3 hours a day in traffic. 10% of my pay goes to gas. Lucky if you are hybrid or remote but from the looks of it management is slowly phasing this out. Admin's answer to this? Save money by taking public transit or vanpool, you don't have to drive but now lose 4-5 hours of your day, flexibility, and not to mention if your car gets broken into at the pickup location parking spots. You've just negated whatever monetary savings. -COVID was a death sentence in the workplace. So much brain talent and experienced staff were lost from either early retirement or simply made significantly more money elsewhere. Every department is scrambling to hire... but can't fill positions because no one is going to accept the low pay, with long and expensive commute, while still paying for meals"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Benefits & Work Life Balance/Poor Leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Manager in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, great team members, being Part of a Bigger Mission, work/life balance, family-friendly", "cons": "non-existent leadership, career growth is difficult, no accountability for poor supervisor behavior, years of annual employee surveys that rate below 50% satisfaction, and no desire to truly fix the issues"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Dispatch Sup Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Dispatch Supervisor in Westwood, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible schedule, accommodation for student commitments", "cons": "change of management, hours may be long/overnight"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Front Desk Worker", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Front-Desker in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "On the campus of UCLA.", "cons": "Can be a bit unorganized."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Receptionist in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great atmosphere, good managers, benefits", "cons": "no room for growth, pay."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Profits over employees", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Easy interview process \r\n-Discounts on UCLA Dining", "cons": "-Hours are horrible -
