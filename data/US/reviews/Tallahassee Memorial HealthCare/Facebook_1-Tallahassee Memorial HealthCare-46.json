I recalled being told by one 30 year employee out of her unkind and bitter heart \"your not an administrator anymore\".

I am blown away that a nurse practitioner didn't even catch it and showed attitude at being called to fix the danger the pt. was being placed in by not having the medication addressed and corrected for safe dosage the moment the pt. arrived at the start of there care.\r\nThere is hardly a visible spiritual center that is traditional and more visible at other hospitals.

Demand it of all staff!\r\nThe maintenance of electrical lights above beds and in the ceilings are way behind and lacking.  The place may be a  beautiful lady of talented care; however  the problem it that her dress is UGLY. The place needs an internal face lift down to the rooms and the pt. supplies areas are not organized that gives each floor a consistent lay out.  As a new person I was frustrated that it took minutes of staring at the wall of supplies to figure out where an emergent item was at. \r\nI know the floors have been improved but, there is still too much time/money spent on managing them.  There are far more advanced decor systems that other hospitals are using that could redirect monies to direct care givers allowing TMH to be BSN staffed and attract the best.\r\nThe utilizing of buses to transport staff on a ongoing and continuous load of expense.  Stop renting to that slum lord leaking room building next door to the hospital to the sad place to call a  private school.  Build a tower of parking for staff only and charge us a fair fee a month to not have to park our butts on the filthy bus system where we have to sit next to smokers and those coughing all over others.  \r\nStop getting rid of staff after 6 sick call ins.  I have had to take two off sick because a co-worker was sick and maxed out on sick days...came in coughing and spreading the germs on us in the air. \r\nI recall how a patient shared with me that she was a former nurse and others fired because became sick from a building of mold at TMH.  Yes, she sued.  Yes, she won...but her illness has taken her to a true low.\r\nStop your surveys that ask questions about your, age, race, how long you have been an employee and other questions that lead the anonymous survey right to your fingerprints.  If you complain and tell the truth of all the questions you are busted. \r\nStop passing staff who are dedicated for training and specialization opportunities because you want to keep them in the hard to fill time slot.  Stop hiring a new person to the area and providing them with the benefit of specialized training.  Practice fair and promotion.\r\nManagers in certain under performing departments. Stop planting snitches among the nursing staff that have all left on you already.
