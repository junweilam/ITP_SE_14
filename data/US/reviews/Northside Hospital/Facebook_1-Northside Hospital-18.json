The patients aren\u2019t always as appreciative as those who are underserved. Their Nurse\u2019s Week is horrible because the fiscal responsibility sometimes turns into just being down right cheap. They tend to promote from within first. You could possibly be passed over for a position b/c they\u2019d rather have nurse that Northside trained even if he/she has less experience. So an experienced nurse that comes into Northside with experience may very well be overlooked for promotion and growth because the less experienced nurse interned and started with Northside & only has Northside experience.
