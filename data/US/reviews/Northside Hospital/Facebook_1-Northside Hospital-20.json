My original review, posted February 6th, was archived and removed from the site after management of the department posted a fraudulent review using my personal Glassdoor account. On March 21st, I received a notification to my personal email that another review was posted and ready for preview. Thinking that was odd, I signed on to see what was going on and there it was... a glowing five-star review of the Molecular department written using my personal and private account. Shortly before receiving the email notification, managment was seen using a public computer in the laboratory with the screen turned. When I checked the browser history, what I saw confirmed my suspicions. I was shocked (to say the least), disgusted and felt extremely violated that my personal account was being used to defraud the public, any future employees thinking of accepting an offer from Northside and the NH administration that apparently stays current on these reviews. A formal complaint was filed with Employee Relations and they said a letter will be sent to my home regarding the outcome, but I have little faith anything will be done about this situation. I am rewriting this review not out of spite or ill will towards Northside, but simply because I think it is important for new hires in Molecualr to know exactly what they are signing up for. This is what management is capable of. This is how they choose to resolve their problems; posting a fraudulent review using an employee's personal and private account. I have seen and been a victim to verbal assaults; statements diminishing my mental and physical capabilities, ageism, sexism, continued unwarranted retaliation and managing employees through fear. Employees that have chosen to stay for a longer period of time show signs of diminished self-worth and self-esteem regarding their laboratory skills and are isolated to completing the same task day-in and day-out, some for years at a time. Outside of following all standard operating procedures and Northside policies, technologists are left crippled, unable to think for themselves, and as scientists, that is what we thrive on. I'm sure there are many bad bosses out there, and being bad and your job is one thing, but this is intentional mental abuse, and it's deplorable. Despite numerous resignations and complaints nothing thus far has been done about management's behavior.

None of them are a valuable resource for any nurse who has more than one year ICU experience at a substandard ICU. Management is uninterested her job and closed off to feedback.

There has been no progress to result from that meeting to this date. This ICU is reactive instead of proactive. The quality of pt care has significantly declined due to lack of qualified educators and the consistent hiring of brand new nurses who are highly under qualified despite completing an internship. Management and clinicians only care about what is documented as opposed to actual events and quality of care. The clinician educators and management attempted to promote false charting (which is illegal and unethical) in order to pass JHACO. The experienced nurses however, stood their ground, held to their morals and oath and gave pushback despite being threatened with write-ups. I have seen medical mistakes swept under the rug due to the fact that the nurse at fault was a personal friend to one of the clinicians. I have seen them attempt to put fault on nurses where fault did not belong in order to protect them or their personal friends who work on the unit.

This review does not reflect any other department except the adjoining Flow Cytometry Lab only because their management overlapped with ours.\r\n\r\nI will start by saying that so far no one has stayed in this lab for more than 3 years and there have been at least two mass exoduses in less than 4 years. Great track record, right? All of the other labs in our building are comprised of staff that have worked there many, MANY years. In the last 2-4 months FIVE people have quit. That\u2019s over half of the molecular lab. \r\n\r\nHave you seen The Handmaid\u2019s Tale? Working there was like being a prisoner in Gilead where you couldn\u2019t speak up or even walk around freely without being watched or reprimanded. This lab was absolutely run by fear, especially fear of retaliation. We were not able to voice our opinions on laboratory matters/operations without some kind of negative action against us whether by being assigned unfair lab opening/closing duties to the likes of verbal assaults. It was frowned upon if you were seen taking a water break in the break room instead of being chained in the lab slaving away and it was kept note of. The management would accuse employees of taking 2 hour lunch breaks in the break room when you were sitting right there with them knowing it was a blatant lie. When they tried to blame innocent people for something that went wrong in the lab and you tried to speak up to tell the truth then they would tell you that the conversation was over so that you were no longer allowed to further implement the truth of whatever situation it was.\r\n\r\nSexism is also an issue. It was more than clear that the management favored the men over the women. Men were always given more and/or first opportunities at the more complex or newest tests. Even if you were a woman who had clear experience on your resume with a brand new test/diagnostics that had not yet been validated by the molecular lab then you would not be included when it was implemented. Instead they would assign a male who had a single week of experience. Absolutely insulting. And if you were a woman who had a PhD (the same as the management has) then you would not be fully trusted and they would worry that you might be a threat.\r\n\r\nEven though the lab was staffed by many former Emory and CDC employees (who had many years of experience) basic laboratory techniques such as pipetting would be questioned due to lack of the management\u2019s understanding of troubleshooting for the given test/assay. We would not even be allowed to simply aliquot reagents without permission. We were treated as children and not allowed to think for ourselves. Another insult to our intelligence. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as far as discrimination/ageism goes there was plenty of it. We all witnessed the management demean and try to fire an older, hardworking middle eastern person on 9/11 last year when they came back from a religious trip. You can\u2019t even make this stuff up. Management approved their 2 week vacation time and also approved the extra day or two that they had to take due to a mishap on their travel coordinator\u2019s part. Apparently this approval of the extra 1-2 days was a big no-no and the management held our next monthly lab meeting (while the employee was still on their trip) in the actual lab instead of the regular office area and called the employee a cheater, over-exaggerating that they took 3 weeks off without permission, blamed them for other\u2019s mistakes that happened while said employee was gone and berated their character. We all knew if any of the other labs that we share a common office space with had heard that they would have been appalled, hence the secret meeting in the lab. Very unethical and unprofessional. And when this coworker went for help to HR and Employee Relations they did nothing except take the management\u2019s side and nothing changed.\r\n\r\nThe management is also very well versed in setting up people to fail usually in order to cover their own faulty errors and reputation. If you speak up or disagree (or even do nothing at all in order to be on their you-know-what list) the management will look for ways to find fault with your performance. It\u2019s sickening how ready they are to point the finger at someone else no matter how minor & frivolous the mistake might be. As stated before in other reviews there are a ridiculous amount of controls in place for a lot of the tests. I agree with the other reviewers that it seems to be a waste of money, resources and time.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the review that claims the management wrote a fraudulent review under their Glassdoor account, it\u2019s 100% true. The management rarely ever came into the lab, much less to \u201ccheck if the internet was working\u201d. They were seen on that lab computer and they strategically & blatantly turned the computer monitor away to hide what they were doing. They were speaking so low you couldn\u2019t tell if they were speaking English or their native language even inches away from them. Minutes later my coworker\u2019s email notification showed a new review posted under her name and we all went and took phone pics of their browser history and everything matched up time-wise. From the browser history it also looked very much like they may have been hacking into the same coworker\u2019s gmail account, but we cannot be sure. It was all very suspicious and obvious.
