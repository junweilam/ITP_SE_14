I just graduated high school and wanted to learn about skin care. My first reaction to Evergreen as a student was, WOW! If I wasn't pursuing esthetics, this is the dream team to work for. I ended up LOVING the family and the overall work environment that I applied to start working as their Guest Coordinator. It was a good stepping stone for me because I learned how to answer phones and book appointments, which would help me later in the spa industry. \r\n\r\nAs I continued my duties, I also learned a lot of great team building exercises which helped me with my fear of breaking the ice and having those \"hard\" conversations with students and staff. The owners must have really liked me enough that they created a one of a kind position to help them out as an Administrative Assistant! I was completely honored!\r\n\r\nHere are some more of the Pros I have learned overtime:\r\n\r\n1) The owners are considered my second family. I never had to feel like I couldn't talk to them about things that were stressing me out professionally or couldn't figure out how to handle a situation. Examples include communicating with the team or dealing with other companies working with us on projects. \r\n\r\n2. One of many great talents they have is teaching you to open your mind a bit and ask certain questions to yourself. There was plenty of times where I would be stressed about a situation and they would ask me 1-3 questions to think about and that allowed me to answer them myself! The students are not the only ones learning there ;)\r\n\r\n3. The staff meetings were a great start to my day! They keep you in the know about what is going on for the week, as well as sharing personal events that really builds the friendship within the team. Everyone has the same amount of duties within that staff meeting so you feel like everyone is working together and no position is more important than the other.\r\n\r\n4. I really faced a lot of my fears including the Big One. Presenting an hour-long award ceremony in front of the WHOLE school. I was very scared because speaking in front of a good amount of people was not my specialty. The entire staff was fully on board with helping me conquer the day, I used all the communication skills I learned there and I succeeded! It was such a relief knowing how much support I had.\r\n\r\n5.  They strive to give back! As a student and a staff member, I was amazed how much care and work was put into the Back to School and Christmas events for the community. They were so much fun as well as very uplifting.", "cons": "I cannot think of any Cons whatsoever about this company, but I know knowing them, they would want to know any feedback so they can improve.\r\n\r\nThis isn't much of a disadvantage but more of a piece of advice for the job seeker. If there is one thing I can say about the Administrative Assistant position, is be on top of your duties and know that the position isn't one to slack on. You are there to support the Owners and represent them.  I felt some pressure in this position since it was so new to me, but planning out your week and month is very helpful. There is always something to be doing at all times. You will ALWAYS be learning something great and something different everyday."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Purpose, Great People Makes a Great Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in Yakima, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I've been working here for almost 6 years now and can't believe how much I have grown professionally and personally. My family tells me that they have never seen me grow so much in my life until I joined the Evergreen family. The culture I can't really describe, but once you walk into the doors, you immedetialy feel the family that owns the company and the community they have built. It is great to get a hug in the morning as well as when you leave.  The company Christmas Parties each year are always memorable and the leadership makes you feel very special and appreciated for our hard work.\r\n\r\nIt is really special that as an employee, we don't get lost in the mix of things. I still remember when I started working at EBC, their onboarding program focused so much on the culture from the way we talk to one another, the types of questions we ask all the way to how we introduce one another. The company is very intentional and has a strong opinion about how we interact with one another and much more relaxed with less structure of how we do our jobs. This is very opposite of what I am used it. I love my 1:1s I get each month with my director as we talk about personal and professional items. It is a requirement for this company and why I love my job.  Thanks for letting me help you start some of your new campuses.\r\n\r\nEvergreen Beauty College is truly a company that focuses on their employees, and in return it attracts some great people and that is what makes our culture.

When you come and join the EBC system, it is so different than other work places where you feel that there is structure about some things and not about other areas as I described above. IN the end, if you stick around long enough to see it, you realize that is what feeds the culture of entrepreneurship and testing of our own ideas. Because of this, the first year is really difficult, I cried many times, but if you got some thick skin and get comfortable being uncomfortable, you will see what I mean. I wish there was a better way to get integrated in the system here so it isn't as painful, but I think that might be part of why the people that are still here are able to do what they do."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Evergreen is a Family", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Educator in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Family atmosphere, employers who genuinely care about you and your own journey.\r\nEvergreen really is a family.
