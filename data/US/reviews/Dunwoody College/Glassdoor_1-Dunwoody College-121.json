You have to take initiative to find your own solutions to problems.  Received very little in terms of course-support.  All courses needed full development of materials, quizzes and tests- which was much more time consuming then I had anticipated.  Some students come to the program with little or no motivation and can be disruptive and unruly.  It helps if you are a confident leader and can be very adaptive and motivated for your students.  This position isn't really for those seeking work-life balance.  Both the students and the instructors are often enduring the late hours for a period of time to better themselves with education or experience."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "A great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jan 2013", "job_title": "Student Worker in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff here is very flexible and accomodating on a personal level.
