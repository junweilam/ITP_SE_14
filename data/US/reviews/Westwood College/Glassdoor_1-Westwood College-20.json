If they don't have enough kids-they cancel the program for that term. Oh and expect to be selling over 80k/year programs When these kids/adults will MAYBE make...12 bucks an hour? At a high? Good luck convincing because a lot of these people cant even pay for a 2.50 blue line ride let alone make payments for school (which by the way-WILL happen. Rare they get most/all covered) And the Career Services? Only will help your student get a job IF it helps them. There is a certain time span they have. If the student doesn't fall in it-oh well. They will just avoid them and not return their calls. Then they will cancel/drop because well...cant get a job. \r\n\r\nThe hours aren't great. 8pm at night? Really? \r\n\r\nRegardless-for profit is going to Hell.

I have a degree in education and when the economy tanked, this was a good option. Sometimes I wonder if that's the only reason they hired me--so they could tell their critics that their staff has education experience.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of every semester, there are these intense meetings for 14 days straight, at least an hour or more each day. All of the department heads would have to attend. The purpose of that meeting? To figure out why student A, B or C hasn't processed their paperwork for their loans/grants/military benefits yet. Why 14 days? Because that's the magic number of days that the federal government requires a student to be attending class before they will send the loan and grant money to a college. The saying was \"We need asses in classes.\"\r\n\r\nAfter 14-days, I was told to stop caring about those students I had just recruited and start recruiting new ones for the next session. The only reason I should be talking to old students is to get names and phone numbers of new people to recruit. \r\n\r\nWe received incentive pay for meeting and exceeding recruiting goals. It\u2019s technically against the law for any school receiving federal funds to have quotas for their admissions recruiters. Westwood will tell you that the goals are \u201cincentives.\u201d If it\u2019s just that, then why are there trophies and plaques and exotic trips for reps who have the highest recruiting numbers? \r\n\r\nWestwood has been trying to get Regional Accreditation (the highest standard available) for years. Whenever the accreditation people would visit, we'd have to take down our plaques and trophies.\r\n\r\nEverything that we did was for the ultimate goal of getting that big fat loan check from the government or a bank. I felt like I was brainwashed. Every time I questioned a recruiting tactic, they would tell me that I was being to \"cerebral\". \r\n\r\nMy director told me to say things like, \"Oh, you said your 7th grade English teacher really supports you going to college. Do you think she would co-sign a loan for you?\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, they fired me for not meeting my sales goals. That was the best thing that could have happened to me.
