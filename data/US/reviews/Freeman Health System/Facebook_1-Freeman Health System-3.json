When you are interviewed they will tell you that they will try to keep you in one place for as long as possible, several weeks if they can. They won't. They will also tell you that if the job doesn't suit you, you can ask to be switched to a more permanent position. This is also untrue. This means that you will end up going to a different clinic every day, sometimes two clinics in one day, or have an impromptu hour long drive to a far away clinic without notice. It gets very exhausting and stressful. While you may be a completely competent medical assistant, every clinic and every doctor wants you to do it a very specific and different way. You are expected to know this when you walk in. If you calmly question anything, or say that you have a preference you get accused of having an attitude and get in trouble. If you're a naturally quiet person they accuse you of not being welcoming enough, and then you once again get in trouble. The whole time you will be walking on egg shells. They will lie to you in the interview and say that you can keep your piercings and tattoos. Then when they float you they will say you have to take everything out and cover it despite every other \"more established\" coworker having them. If your kids get sick, and then you get sick from your kids, be prepared to have an intense guilt trip. You will also be docked multiple points via their disciplinary point system. Do not work here if you do not have a healthy support system to take over for your kids when they are sick. Overall, the turnover rate is enormous for good reason.
