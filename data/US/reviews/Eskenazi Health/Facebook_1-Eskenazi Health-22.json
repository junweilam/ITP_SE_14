One of my current managers got their job without any prior job experience.

Indiana is an at will work state but I still have never experienced management lying to fire someone for no good reason until working here. There are constantly rumors going around. The techs are a tight knit group that aren't welcoming or respectful. They rarely communicate with anyone outside their group, which is usually people with other experience. The head of the group treats everyone else like they are stupid especially if you happen to be forgetful. My training was pretty half assed at best and despite knowing that and being part of that problem, I was still treated like I was an idiot and a waste of breath. There was a time in which I had some words with that person and the way on which they treated me and they ran out of the lab and screamed to everyone that \"she doesn't know what she's (fing) doing, she never knows what she's doing\". Only when I got in trouble for something and then turned around and let management know I knew a lot of the things said about me and other people's completely unacceptable behavior did they care to try and change things. I would come into work, immediately start working while the rest of the techs are breakfast, socialized, completely ignored me. I stopped stocking for a while and noticed what a big difference that made. I was taken advantage of by people who constantly degraded me behind my back and made me seem unworthy of respect in others eyes. It really feels like there is little to no self reflection from certain people here, but those same people love to say the worst things about others. It seems like management here is completely ok with people who are selfish brats with little to no experience running the place. The more people I have talked to about who has worked here and left the more I know- that's exactly why everyone has left. You are treated like garbage and your job isn't even secure.
