This is an organization that is all about management protecting and putting themselves first. There is a zombie like feeling as staff seems to have to call management \"Leadership\" -- a very \"Big Brother\" feel and very hierarchal. Having worked in the field for many years, I can truly say that other non-profits are not this way, and it's very sad that Sweetser, such a large non-profit agency representing Maine social services, should be setting such a poor example. Indeed, employees can get another job, but it is the many hard-working communities throughout Maine that end up losing significantly. Due to overworked, overstressed, underpaid and under-appreciated employees, it is not surprising that the same positions are being filled several times a year because workers are continually leaving.  Sweetser methodologies truly feel  stunted and with an unexpressive and unemotional management , it misrepresents what community services are and are supposed to be. Separate from that, you should know almost everyone complains about the paperwork overload and you will be on a computer easily 6 hours a day, in addition to being in the field 6-8 hours (yes, that means a 12+ hour day). Unfortunately, for no overtime, extremely low pay, and compensation that really doesn't count (I had health insurance but I couldn't afford to use it due to the exorbitant deductible and co-insurance costs), it becomes exhausting and frustrating to work as morale amongst most workers is diminished. Ok, the last but most significant thing to say about working at Sweetser, is that you WILL BE WORKING WITH EXTREMELY VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS CLIENTS ---  so truly beware for your own safety!! After having spoken to many co-workers, it is clear to me that employees are put on the \"front lines\", not given enough support from management, and not protected with enough training. So, from one professional to another, please, if you work for this agency, go into it with your eyes wide open, refuse to be put in danger's way and demand training, so that you don't become one of many casualties. Everything said, my advice is to run as fast as you can away from Sweetser."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Neutral", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Saco, ME", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The vacation time offered is above the norm.
