One Dean was smart enough to draw the line and resign.  \r\n\r\nWhen cuts are made in faculty, it's the Dean's friends who are allowed to stay around.  The New Hires, his less experienced friends, are allowed to keep their job over much more senior and much more experienced faculty members.  The protected brotherhood is a live and well.  Seniority means nothing, experience and dedication among faculty mean nothing.  Retired Military Officers with rank are allowed to stay.  \r\n\r\nBusiness Faculty are providing 3rd party documentation to each other for course clearances.  \"You write me a letter, and I write you a letter\".   There is a clan of about 8 who are doing this.  Letters don't show real work experience, only that they have taught courses at other universities such as Capella.   Experience teaching a class is not a guarantee of a course clearance at Riddle.  But it sure seems to be.  This is all over the College of Business course clearance forms.  Real world experience documented through a 3rd party is REQUIRED.
