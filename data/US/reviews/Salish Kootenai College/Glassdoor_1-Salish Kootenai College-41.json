Discrimination is also rampant, with tribal members being tribalist and disliking the \"white\" employees. FERPA and employee privacy laws are frequently broken and infractions are covered up. Poor communication between different areas resulting in more disorganization; don't take care of injured employees (know of several who have been thrown out like trash - one was a disabled woman who was attacked by a dog on campus). Have also heard about poor financial keeping with frequent false accounting being pushed through. The college no longer meets the vision and mission statement of the founding members. The computer platforms are annotated and obsolete and need updating. Storing all the company records on Google Cloud is not safe either. Worked there for several years and I am very relieved to have a position in another company away from the toxic atmosphere."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "High workload, very low pay", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Administration in Pablo, MT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Uses \"Tribal Preference\" hiring, located on reservation", "cons": "High workload, very low pay"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great to work for!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Sept 2014", "job_title": "IT Support in Pablo, MT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Understanding of expectations, job duties clear, supervisors stellar", "cons": "Micromanagement...to the extreme and can be VERY distracting"}], [], [], []]
