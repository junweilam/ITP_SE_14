You will have to take your work with you on vacations. I was told \"you can buy the internet package\" when going on a cruise during our scheduled week off. The same was said we we tried to vacation out of country.\nYou are met with very passive aggressive management when you want to take personal time. You cant just take days off because you are always scheduled with students and there arent \"extra\" instructors floating around to teach for you when you are gone. \nThis job is great for the following people: workaholics, single individuals who want their life to be their work, people who absolutely dont want to work at the bedside and will tolerate a school with no value on education. Their statements say they care about the quality of student's education but their actions really never show the same.\nAs an instructor there is no room for growth. The next step up is associate dean which means you will work minimum 70 hours a week. You end up making less per hour than you did before. Our deans have no time for us. For the last 3 years most meetings I've had with my dean have been rescheduled because shes too late or they have her in another meeting that is \"more important\". I once had a meeting rescheduled 4 times and each time I was actually there waiting for her to show up and she popped in several minutes after the meeting time and said we had to reschedule. That kind of stuff makes you feel incredibly important as a faculty member.\nAcross all 25+ nursing campuses their NCLEX pass rates have been in decline for a few years and the outlook is grim.
