They want the best for their co-workers, staff members, and administrators who work long hours to keep everything going. The sprinkling of incredibly kind and thoughtful people at ISU is the best it has to offer.\r\n\r\nThe grounds workers and building service workers do great work to keep everything beautiful and clean. One of the reasons I felt at home when I first started at ISU was that I felt my direct supervisors were working just as hard as me, and cared just as much as me. That is rare, as is the ability to find people who can speak honestly about the good and the bad, and there are people at ISU who are able to do that. There are caring students who write thank-you notes for the time you spend with them and students who work and go to school full time, they are tremendous. \r\n\r\nThere are pockets of goodness, however the longer you work at ISU the more evident it becomes that there are many choices being made that are not for the greater good of anyone but people who knew how to kiss the right ring and get paid obscenely for it.\r\n\r\nIf you can find the time and energy, you can get more degrees/education as an incentive. I was able to use my tuition waiver benefit at a reciprocal state university with a stronger name recognition and that has been helpful. You are taxed on any tuition overage if you incur more than $5,250 in courses per year, though.", "cons": "The prevailing culture in higher education is to make decisions entirely surrounding profit, even at a state-funded university. ISU is no different, though they and other universities love to say they are different. They claim to be a great working climate. They claim to care about diversity, equity, and inclusion for students, faculty, and staff. They claim to care about a lot of things. The words and actions simply do not match: there are profit-gobbling Republicans holding the strings at ISU and it's evident. They don't truly care about any of the things I mentioned.\r\n\r\n Human Resources is run by poisonous scabs who somehow fail upwards into huge salaries while there are staff members and graduate students working full time who still qualify for food stamps. ISU's handling of COVID response has been weak and not at all inclusive of safety. They crafted a WFH policy but deny every medical and non-medical accommodation request. The new president is more of the same purse-clenching Republicanism as the last guy, and what's worse is her background is in biomedical science and the COVID management is two steps above abysmal. We haven't had a progressive president in 8 years. There are people on the board of trustees who think that online instruction is useless and that POC are best seen as tokens of diversity. It feels like a nightmare. \r\n\r\nThe only reward for doing a good job is to get more work, and faculty who claim to care about social justice treat staff like servants.\r\n\r\nFailing upwards is a shocking phenomenon that happens in work cultures all over the world, there is no escaping it. But it happens so regularly at ISU that it colors the daily experience of working there and creates a bitter working environment. People who fail upwards even after proving time and time again that they were not even capable of doing the job they came from just make more work for everyone else who DOES care and DOES want to do good work.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ISU has been consolidating staff jobs over the last 5 years so that each job posting is an amalgamation of what used to be 3-5 individual jobs. The workload is impossible and that is why people who don't care get nothing done and people who DO care are worked and stressed to the bone with no incentives for doing so. HR has consistently denied the union attempts to push to $15/hour minimum wage when food service and retail are making their way more quickly to that end. ISU also requires bachelor's and master's degrees for office support and specialized staff jobs, which means that with no consideration of wages, the degrees become valueless. They have minimized the child-tuition benefit to the point where you have to be working there for five years to utilize it.\r\n\r\nI understand there are no perfect companies or universities, there are always going to be gaps in equity, support, and appreciation. I admit that it is time to leave ISU and that is likely coloring much of my review, however it makes me more angry because higher education is an environment that knows better and refuses to DO better. They are the ideological centers of education, that ideology is capable of being implemented in so many ways, even with state funding considerations. Knowing better and doing worse is a greater condemnation than not knowing and making terrible decisions."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Student Manager in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work atmosphere and flexible schedule", "cons": "The establishment can become disorganized"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Valued", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Help Desk Support Technician in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work was challenging\nDidn't always have to work if there was nothing to do", "cons": "Pay not very large\nDifficult problems to solve that give you a headache"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Teaching Assistant in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Grad chemist salary is better than other department salary", "cons": "Good but not enough for your daily upkeep"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Can be a good place...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good teaching load to balance with research - 3/3", "cons": "Collegiality was poor overall, but that dependents on which college you work"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "ISU has a great culture and work-life balance", "cons": "The con for working for ISU is the lack of salary increases"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 May 2021", "job_title": "Instructional Assistant Professor in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive and collaborative colleagues; positive environment that fosters equity, inclusion, and growth mindset; get to work hundred of amazing college students and build meaningful (and hopefully life-long) relationships; further your own knowledge of latest trends and best practices in post-secondary education", "cons": "The pay does not seem equivalent to the workload"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good Benefits", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Academic Advisor in Normal, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "At ISU it all depends on which department you work in.

I'm sure there are a few pockets where the occasional department doesn't discriminate against its support staff, but I haven't found one yet. Most academic departments do not see office staff as even being a part of the department. Faculty here like to stand around talking about microaggressions day in and day out, yet somehow they never seem to notice when they commit classist microaggressions against staff. Also, Normal is such an expensive place to live, many support staff can't afford to live here but instead commute from smaller towns in the surrounding area. Personally, I always have to have at least one part-time job to supplement my full-time income at ISU, and it is not uncommon for me to have to rely on local food pantries to feed myself and one child.
