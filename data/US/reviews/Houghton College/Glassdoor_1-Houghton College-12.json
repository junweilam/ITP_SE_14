You may think you can quietly hold a different belief, whether about faith, political issue, etc, but if you are found out there will be a manufactured reason for you to be fired. Post secondary institutions are generally expected to value rigorous debate and dialogue with different perspectives. That is not welcome here. The administration makes press releases and sweeping generalities in the strategic plan and press, but their actions and investments tell a different story. After a huge press buzz about commitment to carbon neutrality and environmental stewardship, the major, center for environmental sustainability and related programming (which paid for itself) was shut down. A deeply beloved 16 year staff member fired. Another example is the college supposedly values DEI - but closed the urban Buffalo campus serving primarily people of color as well as the Mosaic multicultural center, and fired a woman of color in res life for using pronouns in her email signature. In addition to all that hypocrisy, you will be overworked and underpaid. The last raise for faculty and staff was 3%. As the university is in the middle of nowhere, you will be extremely limited in quality of housing and access to amenities. And due to the size of the community, it is impossible to truly disconnect from work and have a vibrant personal life where you can bring your whole self, because you never know who you can truly trust or what word will make it\u2019s way through the grapevine to the president\u2019s office. Even if you are a right wing GOP conservatism, the atmosphere is a bait and switch- you will feel stifled here. There is no true advancement opportunities unless you accept title changes without additional compensation. There is a lot of lip service language, but not integrity.

There have been continual layoffs and forced retirements for a number of years now (at least 6 years in a row). This has prompted what can sometimes be a dismal environment or at least a perpetual source of anxiety. The school relies heavily on enrollment to make their budgetary goals which makes their ever-shrinking student population that much more distressing and depressing. We were told in my department that if we weren't comfortable with how the latest round of eliminations of programs and staff would come across to prospective students, then we should seriously reconsider why we were working there in the first place. On the one hand I understand the need to put our best foot forward and hope for the best. But there was no outlet for all the frustration and it was incredibly arrogant to effectively tell us to just \u2018deal with it\u2019 as more of our friends and colleagues were being forced out.\r\n2. The school's money woes have led to a loss of staff and/or the ability to retain top talent. This means that everyone is doing the jobs of multiple others and it\u2019s just... expected that you should be ok with this.\r\n3. Pay and benefits were below mediocre. No dental, little professional development, and work life balance was frequently poor. I was told in my interview that overtime would be optional depending on my schedule, but it quickly became apparent that I would be asked to spend lots of evenings working only when I didn't volunteer to do this myself in the first place.\r\n4. Nearly everyone on staff who works there has graduated from the school. On the one hand, this contributes to a sense of community and ownership. On the other, it's no wonder that only those who have a strong sense of nostalgia are willing to endure working here for long periods of time.\r\n5. We worked head over heels to try and convince prospective students that this remote location in western, NY was worth their while because of the natural beauty of the area and how vibrant campus life would be. But in the end... especially from a staff member's point of view, there is very little going on in this area and in the surrounding towns. Most anything of interest is an hour and a half away in any direction. It makes working at Houghton feel incredibly remote. Not great for single people especially!\r\n6. I felt very uncomfortable with how the school set up intentionally low boundaries regarding job responsibilities and my personal life. I don\u2019t want the ability nor to be routinely encouraged to donate to the school through payroll deductions."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "After years of work, decided to cut my loses and leave", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Houghton, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent students\r\nAcademic calendar (winter/summer breaks)", "cons": "Poor management\r\nSevere budget cuts\r\nMultiple faculty and staff cuts\r\nOutrageous insurance costs\r\nRetirement is non-existant"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "A college unlike any other", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Lab Administrator in Houghton, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff here support each other and the students.
