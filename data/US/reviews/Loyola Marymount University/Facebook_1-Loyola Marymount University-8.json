Because of this, there ends up being a lot of turnover of good people that can't afford to stay, even if they would like to.  Tuition remission is part of the benefits package, but there are taxes charged on the cost of tuition, often putting classes out of reach for many employees.  There is a wonderful Children's Center on campus, but again the cost and limited slots put this service out of reach for much of the part time faculty and the staff that are not a part of the upper administration.

You work here, in my experience at least, because you connect to some or all of the mission- the education of the whole person, the encouragement of learning, the service of faith and the promotion of justice. When you have chances to connect with that mission- LMU is a magical place that almost makes you forget you're getting paid pennies on the dollar. The student body is big and diverse, but the connections I did form with a number of students is what inspired me for so much of my career at LMU.\r\n\r\nThe campus is beyond beautiful and in my experience, most of my colleagues are a joy to work with.

For starters, that whole mission of the place shrinks further and further into the background as \"MarCom\" takes its place as the single biggest priority of LMU.

Years ago it was striving to be \"The Georgetown of the West Coast\" and now the language is making fun at being a hidden jewel. At the end of the day, when those who care little about the mission get the money and power, they work on making the place more corporate and focus on Princeton Review rankings (yippee for being #64- if you meet any higher ups just pretend to care). And so the cons of the place are really just the slow destruction of all the pros (minus that whole beautiful campus thing) that used to make LMU such an amazing place to work.
