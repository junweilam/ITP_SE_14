Staff constantly inform leadership/management that they are overworked, underpaid, and has voiced the same concerns for years--if lucky, concerns will take months to be officially recognized yet nothing is ever done to alleviate them. \n\nThere is currently a mass exodus of very qualified, dedicated, and eager staff leaving the University after years of no or very minimal (1-3% every other year) cost of living adjustments that do not keep pace with increased costs in the area. The problem is compounded further by having remaining staff perform additional duties to maintain institutional stability with little or no increase in compensation--causing those staff to burn out even faster and seek employment elsewhere themselves."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Health Educator in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work environment with team", "cons": "Higher ups outside the department don't understand day-to-day because they are disconnected from students"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "HR  integration", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Sept 2022", "job_title": "ERP Specialist in Jersey City, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent culture in the comoany", "cons": "Career development is not there"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Out of touch admin and top-down decision making", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Instructor in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The environment, student body, and faculty are fantastic to work among/ with.", "cons": "The admin at the college and university levels are increasingly interfering with faculty work in ways that feel disrespectful, burdensome, and out of touch with what students need from us.

Really the only annoying aspect of working this post was having to resolve issues that could have easily been avoided if not for errors of the residents who expected mail/special packages. Like, who shows up late to receive a package (which we forwarded early on) that they knew they did not put the right name in the receiver field? Then there's always the pesky residents who don't respect mailroom hours, and those who fail to accept that USPS does not deliver mail on federal holidays."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good transition job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Research Fellow in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good schedule (9-5), nice working environment", "cons": "Sometimes not too much work to do"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent School for research", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Research, equipment, and professors are top quality", "cons": "There have been some decisions made by the president that were wrong against the student body"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Office Assistant in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "not very demanding, flexible hours", "cons": "not many opportunities for growth"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Decent Salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Teaching Assistant in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Professors and environment ttyt", "cons": "Stipend could be higher and less workload"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good Job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible scheduling good pay good workers", "cons": "It gets boring really fast"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "low salaries", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "low teaching load... enough diversity...", "cons": "much low salaries than comparable schools"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Fine  - Could be so much better", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Assistant Director in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and state job security", "cons": "The culture is one of \"in crowd\" \"out crowd\".
