In the 2 years I worked at the Boston Adoption Center, 9 people in the Community/Animal Welfare Specialist position quit, and 2 more quit in the few months after I left. \"Fully staffed\" there are 8 people in this position, which isn't enough people anyways, and we operated with only 7 people for over 8 months before I left. We were constantly scrambling to play catch up, rather than existing in a place where we can be proactive and grow. Eventually, we all burnt out to the point that \"good enough\" was an incredibly low bar in terms of the quality of care or compassion we could offer to animals or clients, which makes you feel terrible but you're in such a bad place you can't even help yourself. \r\n- This is a predatory organization that falsely advertises in the interview process and preys upon the passion and dedication of talented young staff, but provides them little compensation in the form of positive reinforcement, support, a voice or choice, pay, a break room, respect for work-life balance boundaries, opportunities for growth or learning, or even enough staff to feel like we could accomplish everything that needed to get done in a quality manner. Although the Boston Adoption Center seems to operate in a high turnover, \"burn em out and replace em\" method for staffing, there is no formal training program so new staff are inevitably useless for a long time and feel confused and unconfident.\r\n- All of my coworkers and I talked about feeling invaluable and replaceable constantly, and we were all extremely burnt out and suffering mental health consequences such as compassion fatigue, apathy, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and more at the time I quit. Everything is blamed on the individual staff members not being able to handle such a tough job, rather than looking at this as systemic issues that the organization has the power to change.\r\n- Additionally, the pay is not a livable wage for the Boston area, nor is it proportional to the amount of experience and education they require, there is little room for growth, bias and racism are rampant regarding both clients and staff, and nothing concrete is done to promote diversity. Beware that many of the higher ups were snakes who you think you can trust but will turn and use your words against you. \r\n- Of course, the work itself can be tough too, you help animals and people who are suffering or in really hard situations, there are lots of emotions and little time/space to cope with them, clients and the public can become combative or judgemental easily, and you are involved in a lot of complicated, difficult decisions which don't always involve consistency or agreement.

I remember it as a stressful place where employees were quick to point fingers when something went wrong.  In particular the overworked interns, and some of the older doctors, were not very nice to the staff.  Turnover was high for client service positions and emotional confrontations were common.\r\n\r\nI was there during the comm center debacle. The president at the time insisted on replacing all the specialized customer service people in the various departments with a call center full of generalists.  It was a complete disaster but we tried extremely hard to make it work.  Lots of people quit or were fired over it.  MSPCA now has a new president, and from what I hear they have been gradually going back to the old client service by department model.\r\n\r\nSome of the stress comes from the fact that owners are concerned about their pets, and they are paying out-of-pocket, so they have to deal with financial situations that they wouldn't at a human hospital (if they have insurance).  This is exacerbated by MSPCA-Angell's awkward identity crisis.  On the one hand, it is a charity that gets a lot of attention for helping animals, so MANY clients come there assuming it is a low-cost clinic.  It's not!  Angell's goal is to be the best animal hospital in the country, and they charge for it.  They do give out a lot of financial assistance, but there are so many pet-owners asking for help, each person's chance of getting it is tiny.  As a result, working there you will hear tons of horror stories about people who shelled out tons of money and didn't get the results they expected, or felt pressured by the vet to put their animal to sleep because they couldn't afford high-end care.\r\n\r\nWhenever I had to deal with HR they acted as if the staff were their enemies.

Everyone from the Veterinarians to the Client care specialist was friendly and supportive. The West team was so close-knit, and I liked that as a new employee. To see team members banter, joke, and get along with each other, was beautiful and it was a nice work family. \r\n\r\nThe benefits are great! I loved getting 50% off for services/procedures/ medication/food for my pet's and working there I definitely utilized this benefit a lot. Insurance and retirement benefits are also great as long as you are a full-time employee (40 hours per week). \r\n\r\nThat brings me to my next pro; the work schedule is great. As a Full-timer, you work 40 hours a week (4 - 10 hour days), which gives you three days to relax and recuperate. Just be aware that you will probably work alternating weekends.
