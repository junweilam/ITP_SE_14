Instead, they see every work day as a competition just to look better than the rest of us by lying, cheating, mud slinging and taking undeserved credit. They resort to daily micro-aggressions to wear out anyone trying to do good work. When they eventually connive their way into group leader and manager roles there was a mass exit of the good team members. For crying out loud, a hospital is no place for dirty politics, where all that energy can be better directed at saving patients' lives, not enhancing one's own career.\r\n\r\nAnd there are the arrogant MD/PhD types who are so full of themselves that they can't tolerate being contradicted by subordinates and are very vindictive. They squash  open, honest discussions by yelling  and ridiculing the opposing points of view. Just because they are high up in the academic pecking order doesn't mean they are mature, intelligent, sensitive adults. They are not qualified to manage anything more intelligent than a potted plant let alone a lab.\r\n\r\nIt is an understatement to remark how Partners Healthcare lacks transparency. In the past, employees are suddenly \"disappeared\" with no explanation. Wide reaching decision-making even at a laboratory or sub-department level is done behind closed doors. Inexplicably, obviously unfit candidates are nevertheless hired by the managers disregarding the honest feedback from the interview panel. It raises suspicions that something nefarious is always going on.\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by the claim that Partners Healthcare provides a generous vacation package. You may work tirelessly and without a break all year long but managers will not permit you to take more than 10 days off at the end of the year even though you will lose your unspent vacation days.\r\n\r\nAlso don't be mislead to think you can find ways to compensate for the low salary offered to work at Partners. The maximum raise you will get is 2% annually, if at all. The benefits are much less generous than what you can get elsewhere in this economy of 2017. Your coworkers will turn out to have been hired with sub-standard technical, communication, and social skills because they were rejected by more selective employers. Taking the whole compensation package together plus the quality of life, you will carry on a miserable, meager existence compared to your counterparts outside of Partners.\r\n\r\nTo put it into proper perspective, the big name surgeons and scientific researchers are the superstars of the Hospital because they bring in the revenues and the prestige.  Everyone else are considered merely auxiliary and dispensable. Compensation and benefits are doled out accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs sure sign of management's disregard for employees, we were a team of 6 programmers who were crammed into a two-person office. Being elbow to elbow like that made it extremely difficult to concentrate and be productive . It felt like being on an 18th century slave ship every day, year after year."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Treasury Analyst for Partners HealthCare Investment Funds", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Mar 2010", "job_title": "Treasury Analyst in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of exposure to multiple asset classes and investment strategies and face-time with some of the most respected portfolio managers in the business.", "cons": "Very little autonomy in your work with all decisions ultimately being made by external investment committee and very limited hard/software resources."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Professional and Relaxed", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Applications Analyst II in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Perfect balance between personal life and work.\r\nProfessional and relaxed.
