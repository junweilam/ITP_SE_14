Very Senior management at Brookings stated publicly to all staff that research staff should truly come for a couple of years and then move on; take advantage of having Brookings on your CV and bank it. This was a mis-step; not to mention that fellows and Brookings benefit enormously from having a good research assistant they can count on, and tons of time and money is wasted if those people are forced to leave (see below) and then new staff have to be onboarded and learn the ropes. Also, many positions require a MA, so Brookings is not necessarily the first job people have on their CV; there is a definite hubris and condescension in implying that we ever depended on having Brookings on the CV to open doors, if that is what they meant.  However, research assistants would stay a few years or longer in some cases, with no issues. Eventually, I was seeing them push out the dedicated research staff--not renewing contracts beyond a certain point by and large, but giving them a heads up in advance that that would happen as that was the new way of how things were being done. My sense is that some fellows had the sway or political clout to hold on to their assistants, though. Brookings has generous benefits that of course meant it would be more costly to keep full time staff beyond a certain point (2 years; 401k!). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever I note here, though, should be judged against current practice, particularly as there is a new President."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "excellent place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Intern in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "i loved working here - it was a thoughtful and intellectual hub and extremely collaborative. i am sad that i was only there for a short period of time", "cons": "i really don't have any cons. i really loved my time and learned so much. i attended as many events as i could. i guess u can say that a con is that it is too quiet sometimes - but other's like that - it is like working in a library!"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to work for academic research", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Consultant in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great place for an early career professional to begin their career\r\n- Good mix of professionals from different backgrounds\r\n- The energy team has a good working environment with very little micro-management from the vertical head.
