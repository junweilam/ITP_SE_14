A good number of the positive reviews I\u2019ve read are not from medical staff. Some are from IT, and I  know that IT is just as much of a mess as the rest of the place.  More positive reviews are coming from management themselves.  In other cases I would not at all be surprised if management  threatened people if they did not submit positive reviews. Yes, some of management is that underhanded and dishonest. Just like on any site where you are trying to decide to buy something, look for detail, look for the department, which job, for how long, etc..  No doubt there have to be some employees who have had a good experience (if you can find them) so see if there are openings where they worked.  Likely those get filled in-house fast. The best bet is to talk to actual employees. Really make the effort, really take the time. Listen between the lines. Go there from 3 to 4 PM and talk to people going into work and those leaving. (Across from the ER entrance is a good spot.) This will be your life so invest the time. And for goodness sake, don\u2019t even consider moving to the area for a job at DHMC !  Living close by is expensive, a lot of people commute 45 min to 2+ hours EACH WAY !!! But mostly, the place has a lot of toxicity, and not just from pathogens and cleaning products.\r\n\r\n\tI\u2019m not one for bad-mouthing places, restaurants, hotels, certainly not a place where I spent a lot of time making things work and helping a lot of patients (most of the last 20 years), but an aspect of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center that I was aware of but had not affected me personally jumped out of management\u2019s abattoir and sunk it\u2019s meat hooks in me.\r\n\r\n\tIt\u2019s too bad, the place could be a good place to work, some really great people. But that is WAYYYYYYY off in the future.\r\n\r\nThe salient points:\r\n\r\nDO NOT WORK IN GOOD FAITH AT DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK !!!  GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING !\r\n\r\nThe employee model at DHMC is based on the indentured servitude model, a fear and subservience approach. Gotta shop at the company store. They want you to need your job, and they want you to live in fear of your job. Most people who work there NEED the money, the insurance and benefits, DHMC likes it that way and they use it against you.\r\n\r\nWorking from home ? . . . FAGETABOUTIT !!! Even though the CEO herself endorses it there is a crackdown by management to keep people from working from home.  Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve been doing it for 2 years, 6 years, 18 years and have never had a complaint, getting a lot of work done when it comes in, not now !  You will have to sign a \u201cWork at Home\u201d contract, submit to a \u201cworkplace compatibility\u201d inspection, unannounced pop-in inspections AND be required to have childcare while you are there working at home !      What\u2019s the point ! A lot of people working from home do it to save on childcare which they could not afford if they worked in-house 5 days a week. Childcare is expensive !!!  Other people, particularly researchers often have sponsors that are in Europe, different time zones, different holidays. Samples are shipped to those places and sometimes they go missing. More often, changes in protocol or official documentation come in other than standard work hours. \r\n\r\nAn early rising nurse I talked to is prevented from answering early bird communications from patients from home to triage and clear the cue a couple hours before getting to work for some dumb reason.  \u201cI know the patients are up because the just \u201cemailed\u201d me !\u201d she explained.\r\n\r\nFirst rate institutions listen to their people, get feedback and institute changes.  DHMC doesn\u2019t. They tell you what to do.  Even if they\u2019ve never done it.  Especially if they\u2019ve never done it ? . . .\r\n\r\nDHMC makes the mistake of believing its own PR.\r\n\r\nThe current situation in research is a disaster. \r\n\r\nThe new research paradigm from another institution is being hammered into place without the input of those who have been doing research there for decades.\r\n\r\nPeople who don\u2019t have the capacity to do your job, and don\u2019t even understand your job will be telling you how to do your job, and when to do your job, and where to do your job, NOT at home.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t expect to get support from your docs, they are either too afraid to stand up to 30-somethings with BA\u2019s, or don\u2019t have the authority somehow. (Really, I don\u2019t know how some of these managers got hired, what they did to get hired, or what they had claimed to have done to get hired. They are really horrible, not just as managers but as people. Ask around.)\r\n\r\n11 months and counting for two separate research professionals who are being harassed and targeted for removal.  Both do unimpeachable work and bring in lots of $$$$$. What\u2019s the problem ?  Somehow their respective docs with all of their experience and degrees have no say.\r\n\r\nWhen you are removed or forced out or \u201cresigned\u201d your former colleagues including doctors will be told by management not to have any contact with you (Yes. That is true !), and they will obey, most of them. (See: Fear and subservience above.)\r\n\r\nDHMC cares about money, their money not yours. \r\n\r\nDHMC is vastly understaffed which means that if you are a worker you will get other jobs piled on you.\r\n\r\nOvertime is being scrutinized at this point since the place is underwater. That means some of the staff who are doing multiple jobs will being working and not putting in for it for fear of their jobs.  \r\n\r\nDHMC will loudly proclaim that their employees should be compensated for all the work they do and the time they accrue but you could likely be doing the work of at least another half person if not two. You may also have to hire a lawyer to make sure you get all the compensation you are due. I know people who have had to hire lawyers to get their due despite their decades at DHMC, superlative workers and performers, not troublemakers as DHMC will claim.\r\n\r\nDHMC being vastly understaffed hires managers who get rid of people, good people. That doesn\u2019t make any sense, business or otherwise. They find the least resourceful people who are marginally qualified, put them through some sort of narrow, gulag training and let them loose. Clear examples of people rising to the level of their incompetence. The worst part is that higher management backs these people without even listening to the concerns of those who are torpedoed.\r\n\r\nDHMC is not even close to being a second rate institution. The way it is going now it is quickly sliding into a fourth rate institution.  Talk to people who have worked in the Boston hospitals.\r\n\r\nMost of the docs are dedicated and good (though there are some departments I will not use) but the lack of staff is making things increasingly harder to provide good patient care.  Patient care is suffering, patients are leaving, seeking other facilities. Management knows this yet continues to get rid of highly productive professionals and staffs based on \u201cassessments\u201d and \u201cevaluations\u201d (lies ? . . .) of some managers. Know any super pro nurse who was fired for \u201cgoing above and beyond\u201d ?  I do !\r\n\r\nGames are being played by these managers.  Imagine asking to see your latest quarterly evaluation,  your evaluation which an employee is entitled to see and being told, \u201cThese aren\u2019t for you, they\u2019re for me.\u201d  WRONG ! How is an employee supposed to improve ? Power-tripping, that\u2019s all it is.\r\n\r\nNot all departments are horrible to work for, but a lot are. Providers purse their lips and make no comment. Providers know that patient care is suffering due to management.\r\n\r\nCo-workers who don\u2019t play nice and make others in the unit hate to be around them, and as a result, dislike a job they would otherwise enjoy, don\u2019t get fired. People who go above and beyond get fired or forced out. It\u2019s like some weird opposite world over there.\r\n\r\nDo not go above and beyond !  That will count against you. Do get everything in writing. You cannot trust DHMC management. They are NOT looking out for your benefit. Lawsuits are the only thing that management understands.\r\n\r\nThere will be growing pains when a new system is being implemented, understood. But why force changes on research that is already being done by super-pro researchers with superlative results ? Does not make sense.  Why destroy existing research ?  Why not get the system going with new research projects ? Ease it in, work out the kinks instead of ruining patients samples.  This speaks to the level of competency of management.\r\n\r\nIf you plan on getting into research at DHMC, reconsider. If you plan on doing research in the department of Medicine then you are masochistic or otherwise mentally ill. (You will likely not be the only one.)  Talk to the people there.\r\n\r\nThe way a lot of people are treated at DHMC is so bad, so beyond the normal, rational, human mind that if this were a book you would put it down because it is too unbelievable.\r\n\r\nNursing is the most respected profession in the country, except at DHMC.\r\n\r\nResearch is not the only area with this metastasizing cancer . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019ve have heard recently:\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you are willing to fire people you will move ahead in management.\u201d  From a retired health care professional (HCP) with 30+ years at DHMC.\r\n\r\n\u201cWho does she think she is !?!\u201d An HCP with 30+ years of varied experience (from whose mouth I\u2019ve never heard a cross word let alone a bad one) about a new manager who seems perversely bent on destroying the work professionals have been doing for decades. Work which brings in significant money and increases DHMC\u2019s reputation.  Upper management definitely doesn\u2019t care.  Is this how they are training management ?\r\n\r\n\u201cThat department is a cesspool.\u201d  HCP with 40 years of varied experience hoping to last a few more years to retirement without getting fired like other HCP\u2019s this person has worked with.\r\n\r\n\u201cDHMC is a disaster. It is getting impossible to do good research here.\u201d Research professional who has worked in top research facilities in major cities and other parts of the country and could be making triple the money if she wanted to move back.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe way DHMC treats its people it deserves whatever it gets.\u201d An HCP with decades of patient care and treatment, and decades in research.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the Boston hospitals where I worked the nurses were listened to. Our opinions and suggestions were valued. In fact, we were regarded just the same as the docs, no separation. That doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d  HCP with 3+ decades of varied experience in Boston who is not being utilized or listened to at DHMC.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe devices used to be downloaded and the readout given to me prior to my appointments.  Now I have to go to the secretary to to get it downloaded. This takes a big chunk out of my time with my patients.\u201d  HCP specialist who is being hamstrung by lack of staff. Oh, the person who used to do the downloads as well as a whole bunch of other highly necessary things is gone despite warning management that things are not going well for her is gone. She used to be able to do a device training when asked by a doc THAT DAY.  The wait for getting a training is now 3-4 months.\r\n\r\nThis is what dedicated HCP\u2019s at DHMC talk about. I have never, ever once heard any person I know who works or worked at DHMC come close to saying (and with 20 years of association, I know people . . .), \u2018What a day I just had at work ! I love my job at DHMC .\u2019  Come to think of it, I may have been the closest to saying that . . . Then the new management showed up . . .\r\n\r\n17 years combined, lean, light, part time and cheap, bringing in lots of money for DHMC, the job we did could not have been done better, you think we would be lauded, at least a \u201cthank you\u201d. That team is gone ! I have not heard one word from any of the former team members - Principle Investigator, Sub-investigators. That\u2019s how much you will be valued and appreciated by DHMC. The study I had ready to go last summer has started . . . technically . . . But no patients. DHMC is out hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not multiples more) with a significant hit to their research reputation. Upper management supported the decision to get rid of us. You have been warned.", "cons": "Management: \r\n\r\nAt any institution management should be there to work out the kinks, the \u201cpaper jams\u201d, the \u201c800 pound, rabid gorilla\u201d problems to keep things running as smoothly as possible.  Not at DHMC. Too many managers act like their unit is their little fiefdom and their word is law, even if they were in junior high school when you were doing outstanding work there.  Why make things harder for people ? . . . Oh, that\u2019s right, ego . . . \r\n\r\nConsider yourself lucky if you simply get a competent manager, let alone a good one.\r\n\r\nYour actual performance does NOT matter, only what you \u201csupervisor\u201d says your performance is matters, even if he or she has never even seen you work, OR even understands your work. The assessments of you colleagues, docs, and co-workers doesn\u2019t matter.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter if you have done decades of superlative work, qualitatively and quantitatively, bringing in a lot of money, no complaints or disciplinary issues, get along with everyone, if some 30-something with a BA wants you out, you are out ! They will be backed up by other management (all the way up . . .) most of whom do not understand what you do They don\u2019t care about the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the institution. They don\u2019t care about the deep hit to DHMC\u2019s research reputation.  All that matters to these people is, \u201cWHAT I SAY GOES ! PERIOD !!! \u201c  And they will be backed up.\r\n\r\nSome of the managers in charge of research have no business even talking to actual human beings let alone lording it over professionals. A good number of these people are making nurse practitioner money ($90K+) and do not understand what research entails, and some are gone by 3:30 every afternoon. A former unit manager I knew used to be there till 7 PM to keep things running as smoothly as possible.  She\u2019s gone now.\r\n\r\nHR is simply a tentacle of management used to gather information against you. HR is NOT on your side.  This comes from people with decades of service to DHMC before my own experience with HR.\r\n\r\nImagine having your manager tell a health care professional (HCP) that the long distance trip put in for at least 6 months prior, already bought and paid for, could not be taken because the manager had not found a replacement yet. That was a week before the trip. How\u2019s that for building morale ?\r\n\r\nImagine a manager telling an HCP the week before the person\u2019s wedding 1000 miles away that that person could not go to their own wedding because that person had not found their own replacement yet. That\u2019s management\u2019s job.  Again, morale ? . . .\r\n\r\nThat manager is still there. Management has the time to harass and torpedo staff but does not seem to have the time to do some of the really important actual managerial tasks. Pitching in when it is busy ?? Not these people.\r\n\r\nDo not go above and beyond !  That will count against you. Do get everything in writing. You cannot trust DHMC management. They are NOT looking out for your benefit.

I have had patients who have gone through 5 PCPs in the last 3-4 years but this doesn't seem to phase Dartmouth. During the hiring process they promise docs wonderful things to maximize efficiency such as having patients scheduled 15 min earlier than their appointments, daily huddles to look for bugs in schedule, autonomy over one's practice, late and no show policies; then once hired, docs discover none of these actually happen.  They don't seem to get it that the doctors are the money makers for them and if they would concentrate on the issues that made the docs lives easier, not only would the doctors be happier but we could also see more patients.  Middle management is completely oblivious to the issues that need fixing in the clinic setting,and when employees attempt to address issues, they are labeled as \" complainers\" and essentially told to suck it up. There is absolutely no support for doctors.  The scheduling of patients is an absolute nightmare with the philosophy being- stick patients in anywhere regardless of their issues-they have a protocol for visits based on their complaint but they never follow it and any complaints about this fall on deaf ears so docs are forced to address more issues in inadequate time which leads to poor patient care."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Trouble in Oz.....", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Can't Say They Like to Retaliate in Lebanon, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A beautiful building on a beautiful campus (on the outside).

It's no wonder they are not getting Magnet designation again....one look at the nursing and patient satisfaction rates and the surveyors were alarmed. They are sadly not alone. as most staff is miserable and feel trapped into working there as there are not many other options in the area.  Employees are expected to drink the Dartmouth Kool-Aid, and when they don't, they are \"counseled\" about not being a team player and made to feel small and ind=significant and replaceable.  You are not allowed to advocate for staff or patients, and there are many MANY medical errors made in the facility daily, all covered up and never mentioned except in whispers in offices and meeting rooms. As a nursing leader, I was chastised for standing up for staff and patients. Many leaders with tenure take advantage of their position by coming in late, leaving early, going to workout for an hour during the day, leaving to run personal errands, or just taking hour long walks outside on nice days...all while hell is breaking loose inside the facility. Staff work in fear of losing their jobs instead of being encouraged to share ideas to make work better. The majority of computer platforms do not work well with each other, leaving employees frustrated and patients open for errors to occur.  This severe lack of communication starts at the top....I NEVER saw or met the CEO or CNO...those people you see in the newsletter touting themselves to be on the front lines with us. Forget it! They are locked up in their office or on \"business trips\" promoting themselves. In short...the employees make THEM look good.And forget taking your concerns to HR, they are as nonchalant about the corruption as Senior Leadership.  How hard is it to know that your employees want to be recognized and appreciated and in turn will give you 110%? It's not rocket science....be visible, be appreciative, and know when to step up and help. Don't act like you are doing them a favor by letting them work there. Some staff are choosing less money at smaller facilities just to get away from the insanity. And patients are choosing smaller community hospitals where they are treated like people, not experiments or numbers.  I would never seek care here for myself or my family. Check their sepsis rates prior to 2014, look at their HCAPS scores....Dartmouth Hitchcock just doesn't deliver the stellar care they say they do.  They have their share of cleanliness issues: bedbugs, lice, ants...they don't even isolate MRSA patients, so a perfectly non-infected person could be sharing a room and bathroom with someone with active MRSA.  I must have heard 100 times, \"We don't have to worry about patients coming here, where else are they going to go?\" Well guess what, DHMC, they are going in DROVES to Boston and other places that are better managed, with better patient outcomes and happier staff.
