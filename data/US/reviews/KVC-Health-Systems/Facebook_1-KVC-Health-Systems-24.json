Now I am grateful knowing that all of my fellow staff members went through the same process. I have never worked in an environment where I felt so supported and valued by my fellow staff members, managers and supervisors. The added bonus here is the kids. Nothing makes coming to work easier than feeling like you matter. The longer I am here the more I can see the big picture which includes how our system actually is a small part of a super comprehensive plan to provide the help and healing that our these kids and their families need! Once in a while I might get a little overwhelmed at the sheer gravity of it all, but my teammates are always ready to jump in just as I am for them. \nThe tangible benefits are great too. Robust coverage packages through Delta dental, BCBS health and EyeMed vision along with prepaid legal, FSA/HSA, and more I don't even remember and I pay less than I did through my old employer. I do wish we had AFLAC coverage available but that was definitely not a deal killer for me. I also look forward to the day when we have enough committed staff members that we can actually call our units \"over-staffed\"\nBottom line is if you are looking for a fast-paced exciting team environment were you can make a real difference everyday; I say you could certainly do worse than giving KVC Health Systems a shot", "cons": "Being \"In the thick of it\" (where child and staff interract) is a small and seemingly enclosed system.

We don't get to see all the moving parts so it can be very easy to discount what we do as unimportant or ineffective and there is a high possibility of morale falling; but then you see little signs of a kids improvement. Less defiance, fewer episodes, more effective coping with stressor: and you have hope for that kid.. Then when they discharge and you know they will be successful... \nBeing right at the edge of staffing requirements can make a fast-paced environment go from exciting to more than just exciting in like a quick fast hurry. Also working for a not-for-profit often means things staff would like to have are put on the waiting list so we get the things we need. (Although we did get free massages this last week). Finally such an environment requires all staff to be united but sometimes in a communication breakdown some information will get lost in the shuffle which can leave some members of the team feeling out of the loop or like their opinion doesn't count."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "This really is a great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "25 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "KVC Nebraska is the best place I have worked in the helping field.

I cannot work that many hours. \n-Workers who improve outcomes with measurable quantitative success are not rewarded for such work and instead are expected to continually carry a heavier load. I also believe KVC could do a better job with DCF to improve and streamline reporting requirements. There are too many types of documentation that duplicate the same work, leading to confusion, wasting time, and failing to document things already documented in favor of doing required visits (which is more important, seeing a child in person to ensure safety and care, or writing the second report that says the same thing as the one you already wrote?)\n-Benefits are fair but not appropriate for maintaining people who are real professionals. If you want good staff, pay for it and hold then accountable. Turns out competing agencies offer twice the vacation pay, tuition reimbursement, 5% retirement match, full payment of health insurance, etc. Flexible work schedule is not a benefit. It's more like you set your own hours because you have to be flexible to what your clients need. So if you don't want to work nights, too bad. You're working nights. They also try to tell you they won't pay overtime (illegal) or that they won't pay mileage over a certain amount. This leads to people not doing visits because there are not enough company cars.\n-so much work it's expected you respond to texts, emails and phone calls while driving as long as you don't talk about it. \n-so much money is wasted on people who falsify documents or are horrible to children.
