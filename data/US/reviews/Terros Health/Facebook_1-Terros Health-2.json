Other employees weren't trained as well and they are all in the same boat. I was closing the other therapists files and making numerous mistakes because I had -0- training at that point with claimtrak.  I still continue to get blamed for his mistakes. We haven't billed Magellan for our work because our client files are so badly messed up.  Management is blaming the 11 employees in our colo program when they had no formal training PERIOD.  Why not take 2 days and train everyone at once?  Even the supervisors are constantly changing their minds about what information to enter into client files!\r\n-If you work at a CO LOCATION as a BHT, you do the same work as CLINICIANS who are paid more.  15.25 is my wage for a masters level counselor.  After a year you're lucky to get a 30% raise.  \r\n-We have to do ALL of the paperwork, client intake information which takes FOREVER, on top of soliciting our own clients from the case managers and addressing their numerous concerns, and trying to convince them why they should give you referrals, you have to attend their morning meetings as well.  Tracking down our clients when they don't show, attending seminars, supervisions, case management activities ourselves, and it leave very little time to do client care.   Why am I being paid so little to do 4 jobs?\r\n    -Other agencies and other programs at Terros have their own intake people, they don't have to solicit their clients from frustrated case managers, they don't have to worry about clients CONSTANTLY missing their sessions because of unreliable cab service, their mental illness, and their case loads are nowhere near as heavy.  Terros overworks its colo employees. My job is 20:80  20 percent client care, 80 percent paperwork and case management and cleaning up messes. \r\n-Health insurance is awful.  For blood work two times and 2 doctors appointments I have to come up with 700 out of pocket!  There are no copays.  you have to either hit a 2k or 1.5k deductible.  \r\n-Pay has been frozen for years\r\n-No opportunity for advancement whatsoever\r\n-I am all alone at my clinic, and if I have a question, it takes forever for people to respond because they're so busy.\r\n\r\nIf you're a masters level counselor, APPLY SOMEWHERE ELSE.
