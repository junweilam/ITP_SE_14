CM2 client load varies from 45-65 individuals with a needed productivity of 85%. \r\nLong story short. GLMHC used to have that small non-profit feel. There are no bonuses or incentives to excel at GLMHC. As a residential counselor, CM2 or CM3 expect to get left-overs in the cafeteria from parties that senior level managers have. Expect a starting pay of 14 dollars an hour with your Masters degree. Expect your computer not to function. Expect to have regular meetings with your supervisor for not meeting productivity (100% of employees goes through it, not just the bottom 30%).
