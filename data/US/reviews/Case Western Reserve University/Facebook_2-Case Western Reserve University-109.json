Raises are a laughable two percent at there highest level for most employees, which means with inflation you are actually losing money each year. College promotes not on accomplishment, ability or performance, but on how many years one has been with the institution. The first thing a Case employee tells you when meeting them is how many years they have been with the institution. There are many people at Case who haven't had a new idea in 30 years and they're proud of it. Decisions are not made based upon what is best for the institution, but rather what is best for the decision maker and their personal career. Chances to save real money and advance the University are often overlooked or stalled because of one persons desire to protect their turf. Much of the campus infrastructure is aged, everything from  network cabling in research buildings to placement of electrical outlets is from the 1960's.  The college has fallen behind the IT curve in general and embraces no modern concepts of having things like a project management office for campus, regular training for employees or feedback sessions where employees can let upper management know what issues are plaguing the college.  The college operates as though it has no money and is some sort of inner city school district but has money for absurd expenses like full color magazine like documents to communicate what the IT strategy is for the year or some obscure HR program that few attend."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Overall, A Great Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jul 2010", "job_title": " in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can provide a flexible work environment, ability to work with young, talented students and accomplished faculty, large community, well known.", "cons": "Higher education does not pay well for those that are staff (non-faculty) and staff are considered second class citizens to faculty."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Case Western is a decent place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Feb 2011", "job_title": " in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "New president with solid ideas on rebounding from economic downturn.
