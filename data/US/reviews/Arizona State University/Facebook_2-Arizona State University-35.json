Never mind that many arrive unable to write a sentence and needing much more help to get used to college, we are expected to take care of them. We're paid for 40 hours a week, but typically have to work 80 hours a week to keep up. We're expected to be grading machines. A typical semester requires that we grade (line edit, explain problems, mark errors) over a 1000 assignments. The recommended maximum number of first year writing students per instructor (per the NCTE) is 65. We're being forced to teach 125. When I got here 10 years ago, I had 76 students each semester. Now, I have 125. Our load has increased by 46% and there's been little or no compensation for that increase. We're asked to give more than is humanly possible. And we care about our students.

Since Michael Crow came on as President, the environment at ASU has become increasingly corporate-like (for both faculty and staff) without any corresponding pay increase. In fact, we went 5 years without raises (plus with furloughs one year) except there was still money in the salary budget to recruit very expensive senior faculty (i.e., they became famous at another school from which the retired to come to ASU so Crow could claim that some famous person works here), create an extremely top heavy (and very well paid) upper administration, and artificially promote management in order to bypass the pay freeze. ASU also created a policy to limit the amount of pay increase a non-managerial staff person could receive when moving to a new department (historically one of the only ways to get a real pay raise at ASU). Some high level administrators make as much as 3 times the amount many of the senior faculty make yet contribute very little to the quality of the education or research at ASU. Typically, those who generate the revenue get little or no benefit from their work while the upper administration (which often makes the revenue generators jobs harder rather than easier) make the big bucks. The direction of the university seems to be determined by Crow's ego rather than what is good for students, the university, or the broader Phoenix metro and State of Arizona community (the disastrously expensive ASU Medical School failure being a case in point).\r\n\r\nDepartments vary tremendously in size and structure and, unless your job is in the university-wide administration, career advancement almost always requires changing departments. Depending on the position, there isn't always a good reporting structure if you are having problems with your job. If you work directly for a faculty member, they are almost like a mini CEO and you can't really go over their head if they behave badly - so there is nothing you can do about a bad boss. This is also true if you work in a small department or center. HR is pretty much ineffective and some of the nastiest and most abusive faculty members are so bad that even HR won't reprimand them.\r\n\r\nAll employees are basically contract employees so your supervisor can decide to get rid of you for any reason at the end of the fiscal year (although they do have to give you 90 days notice of non-renewal of your contract). This was a recent change which was, like so many corporate 1984ish double speak, touted as something \"beneficial\" to employees.\r\n\r\nThe better paying and better career opportunity jobs are at the university-wide administrative level. However, they only seem to want to hire \"yes men\" in those positions. People who raised legitimate concerns about significant policy changes (some of which were disastrous and continue to create problems even after many years) have slowly disappeared from the university. Unless you are an outside hire at a top level, challenging the status quo is an absolute no-no - regardless of your level of experience or expertise. The upper administration wants the exact opposite of Lincoln's \"team of rivals\".

Meanwhile President Crow greedily accepted a 20% raise for himself in the midst of the budget crisis. \r\n\r\nThe administration has no regard for the people under them. Employees are just a number and they will use you until they wear you out and then they will shove you aside  to make way for a new person who will take a lower salary. Our department chair refused to meet with our rank in the midst of a crisis in which we were being told we would have to increase our work load by 25%. He wouldn't discuss the situation with us or allow us to be part of the solution. Instead, he unilaterally decided to cut our merit raises, which were earned over years of highly meritorious service, and increased our work load 25%. At the same time, he gave new, unproved Instructors a 20% raise. \r\n\r\nPresident Crow has gone before the Arizona State Legislature and stated that he promises raises and then doesn't follow through in giving them in order to get us to work harder. Yes, our rank has experienced that phenomenon, no raise in 10 years, then a promised raise that never showed. He seemed proud of this way of getting more work out of university employees. He also begged the legislature to allow him to cut the two good benefits to teaching at ASU: the state health benefits and state retirement. President Crow, you can't have it both ways. You can't pay us bottom of the barrel salaries and also give us bottom of the barrel benefits.

They have worked to improve faculty salaries but, overall, they still lag behind market.

So, don't count on this unless you're older or plan to spend 25 years here. \r\n\r\nIf you do use the waiver, all of YOUR graduate waived amounts over a certain amount per year will be added as income and you will be outrageously taxed on it.

But I enjoyed my students and my department and I felt as if I was making a difference in the world.  Last year, after close to a decade of working at ASU, and receiving high marks on both my teaching evaluations and on my annual instructor evaluations, I finally received a merit pay increase. This merit pay increase was .5% of my annual salary.  However, THIS year, we are being asked to teach two more classes per year and, while the salaries are being \"bumped up\" to $36K (for a 5/5 teaching load of 25 students per class), the merit pay has \"vanished\" from the equation and some of us are actually being paid LESS for this teaching load than we were previously. \r\n\r\nI've always been more than willing and able to find time to help students in my off hours, to counsel them about how to navigate the increasingly-large university, to urge them to continue on with their dream of completing their education.  Given this new teaching load and the fact that, in order to make up for that missing salary, I will be forced to teach somewhere else in addition to teaching at ASU, I won't be able to hold as many hands.  And no matter what people think, beginning college students are practically children.  They need extra help and encouragement to find their path. First-generation college students are even-more so, and, increasingly, this is ASU's college population.  They need MORE help, not LESS. In addition, tuition keeps increasing.  This raises the question. Where is the money going?\r\n\r\nIt's clear now that ASU does not truly value students, or student retention, simply the number of students rolling in the doors and their tuition dollars.  Even if those students don't manage to complete their degrees, in part because classes have become so big that they cannot get any personal attention, ASU still gets the student-loan funds.  \r\n\r\nASU is the Walmart of education.  If you can avoid teaching here, do so at all costs. You won't make enough to pay your bills, or your own student loans, and you won't be able to help students as effectively as you would elsewhere."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Learning Opportunity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Was able to learn hands-on research practices at the Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention and Research that was applicable to my degree while also earning money.", "cons": "Technology in the office module was sometimes unreliable, making it hard to work on certain projects in a timely manner"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Program Assistant", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Program Assistant in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "ASU is one of the leading universities in the world and it really builds connections to new networking groups and helps with your development with hands-on experience.", "cons": "In Arizona it gets really hot.
