Fast forward to post-pandemic, and despite having successfully done our jobs remotely for a year and a half, staff is not allowed to work from home at all (unlike other public universities that are developing hybrid work models for all employees, like University of Utah). Upper administrators have even said to their staff, \"we don't trust you.\"\n\nThroughout the pandemic, advising staff was required to be in the office \"to meet with students,\" despite all classes being online and in-person meetings with students being very few and far between. In one unit, the entire advising team only met in-person with students a total of six times for the whole year, yet they had to jeopardize their health by being on campus. Everyone who worked remotely also had to continue paying for their parking ($260-$780 per year) or risk losing their spot. \n\nMeanwhile, class sizes keep increasing and the units aren't given nearly enough support to hire faculty to meet this demand. Class sizes for service-level courses have doubled in ten years, yet the lowest-paid faculty continue to have to teach an increasing number of students. Bottom line: students are not getting the same attention and mentoring they did ten years ago, despite rising tuition costs. It just isn't possible without smaller class sizes and more teachers.\n\nTo recognize all employees for the very difficult work of 2020-21, ASU is giving all ASU staff and faculty a \"significant\" merit increase on fall 2021: a whopping 1-5%. And this is without any COLA or other increases in 2020 at all... I wonder how much the deans, provosts, and president are getting...\n\nASU sees students as numbers, as revenue, while claiming to care about individuals. Individual units/schools/departments certainly care and do the best they can, but the highest levels of administration don't understand what the units actually need to do the work and don't provide the resources."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Director of Online Strategy in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are good for a family", "cons": "Decision-making is not transparent.
