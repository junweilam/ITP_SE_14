Narcissistic behavior; speeches about caring for their employees and promoted an open door policy, yet they were inaccessible and would gaslight you if you went to them with any concerns. Experienced Gender & Class Discrimination. Although I was hired to promote DEIA, I still experienced, directly and indirectly, discrimination by senior management. I reported the incidents in my resignation letter and expressed concerns about promoting an institution that would allow such toxic behavior. They decided to fire me ahead of my end date, citing my inability to conduct my job due to my concerns. However, before my firing, I was taking on additional recruitment days, and they were going into a period when the interns were taking on the recruitment roles in preparation for the reading season. I was scheduled to leave during that time. They offered me a confidentiality agreement at my firing, which I did not sign. Inappropriate Behavior. The Director divulged sensitive information about why another employee (my direct supervisor) was let go without prompt. Work-Life Balance Unmanageable. The job itself asks for a lot for an entry-level position. Having had a 15-year career in a different field, I came to the position looking for a change and new challenges. As an Admissions Officer, you are exempt and don't receive any comp pay or days for the additional time you put in for working holidays, weekends, and nights outside your normal responsibilities. It seems management actively seeks inexperienced individuals to exploit their naivety in how a good workplace should be managed and how they should be treated. During the reading season, you could work up to 16 hours daily. During travel season, you are expected to travel on your personal time. It is highly discouraged to travel during work hours. God forbid you have any past experience and skills. They will take advantage of that and give you a larger workload than those at your same pay scale and title. Yet refuse to provide you with proper compensation. When I brought these concerns to management, the response I received was, \"You gotta do what you gotta do.\" When I brought up not having the proper compensation or job title for the amount of work that I was involved in, the Director made a statement suggesting neither was he, making a comparison between the both of us. However, he was my supervisor with a higher title and better pay than myself, making it an unfair comparison. The Director would expect you to hop on calls after 5 pm and had no sense of boundaries between work and your personal time. I only have had this single experience in undergrad Admissions, but through networking, it seems this is commonplace in the field. I highly suggest normalizing unionizing in the industry for anyone looking to go into the undergrad Admissions field but would like to be treated respectfully. The student tour guides at Hamilton College have gone to these lengths to be treated fairly and have won."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Vassar College", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Poughkeepsie, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent work environment Supportive coworkers and professors", "cons": "No cons here.
