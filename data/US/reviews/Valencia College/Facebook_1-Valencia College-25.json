"job_title": "Professor in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I am finding fewer and fewer pros to work at Valencia as time passes. Colleagues are, for the most part, good people, but the further up the totem pole you go, these \"good people\" start turning into \"bad seeds.\" Whether it is the toxic culture and initiation rites that produce these insufferable, out-of-touch characteristics over time or the Stepford Wife cult-like mentality the administration seeks in would-be employees to hire upward, the longer one stays at Valencia College and the higher their role, the more tone-deaf, unrealistic, and fake these people become. Valencia College, however, is exceptionally diverse and inclusive, and it does bend over backward to meet the needs of their students. Whatever good things you hear in the national news about the care and feeding of students is absolutely true. This is where we shine. People genuinely do care about our student body. However, the saying that one must \"put on their oxygen mask before putting on their children's\" rings true here... the worse employees feel about their employer, the less emotional labor they have to give inside the classroom, the advising office, the tutoring center, etc.", "cons": "Benefits used to offset the low wages, but as of 2023, the school has decreased the standard packages available to employers and upped the cost. Compensation is laughable, particularly in an area (Central Florida) that has been noted repeatedly as having one of the highest housing increases nationally and the most dramatic cost-of-living increases since the beginning of the pandemic with an influx of transplants to our warm-weathered state. With the new legislation being rumored to pass by 2024-2025 academic year, K12 teachers will be making more money ($60k) than a majority of employees who have been at Valencia for decades. Bottom line: if compensation matters to you, this is not the employer for you. Growth opportunity exists only if you're a favorite, and there's little, if any, as a professor. They are, for all intents and purposes, doing away with tenure like most schools in the nation; here, they're simply not renewing tenure lines, limiting continuous annual contracts, and increasing the amount of adjunct lines. Tenured and tenure-track employees are on a 5/5/0, while annual contracts are on a 6/6/0 and become adjunct status over the semester and may not receive any classes. Adjuncts are capped at 4 classes a semester and have not had a wage increase in years. Adjuncts are newly represented by a union that has been fighting hard for a raise, but the school has fought them hard in bad-faith negotiations. Over the pandemic, we've had \"huge\" wage increases lauded by the administration: a whopping 2.5% in 2020 followed by a 4.5% in 2021, the \"highest ever.\" While it does sound like a lot for a public institution, keep in mind that wages have been extremely low for decades. These wage increases did not keep up with the cost of living or the housing market, though Valencia administration will tell you otherwise. Valencia College has rested on the laurels of its Aspen Prize since it was the first winner of this award, but it has done nothing to benefit employees and reward them for their time, effort, and expertise except promote the tired idea that educators should be doing this work because we are called to serve. When administration stops getting absurd paychecks or takes cuts to proportionately be in line with its lower-level employees, only then can they say they also serve out of the goodness of their hearts, as they ask employees to do. To top everything off, burnout has been an issue since day one, but since the pandemic all educators have faced terrible burnout... and Valencia leaned hard into the call to volunteer even more time than usual and implicitly shame workers who could not find the bandwidth to contribute because they had already been operating under chronic burnout conditions for years. To ask employees to step up to volunteer and serve even more than they already have during a time of crisis and then underpay them reeks of disloyalty and signals that they truly do not care they undervalue their employees. Sandy Shugart is no longer president; Kathleen Plinske is president. Aside from the increased salary, she also took a \"moving bonus\" the size of 3 adjuncts' annual salaries to stay put in town. This is not an egregious pocketing of money compared to other administrators and corporate jobs elsewhere, but if this does not demonstrate the corporatization of Valencia College beyond the pale, I'm not sure what does."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career

I have a lot of positive and fond memories of my time at Valencia and will list them below.\r\n\r\n- The people and students: In my multiple roles I served primarily in student facing jobs, most of which were with student employees. My interactions with the students were what kept me going and seeing their development and growth was always an extremely fulfilling feeling. In addition I worked with a fantastic, diverse team who made coming to work enjoyable and created lasting friendships.\r\n\r\n- Benefits: Valencia's Total Rewards program is among the best I have seen. If you are a single individual, you can get the best health insurance plan they provide and Valencia pays the premium in full. Al you will have to worry about are small add-ons like dental, vision, and life insurance.\r\n\r\n- Initial growth opportunities. My personal and professional development grew immensely during my time at Valencia. I can credit this to my leadership who was more than willing to provide me opportunities and know that I had their trust and support. \r\n\r\n- Flexibility: My leadership were incredibly flexible with things like time off, adjusting hours, working with schedules etc. I was very much treated as a person and colleague and my supervision always genuinely cared for my well being and health. I may have just gotten lucky with who my supervision was but I do know other colleagues in other departments who had similar.", "cons": "As said, I worked at this institution for almost 8 years. Towards the end I really began to see the cracks and issues that make Valencia a frustrating place to work if you are in a similar career path/development point as me.\r\n\r\n-Upper Management and Senior Administration are completely out of touch with what the needs and wants of the main workforce. There has been a lot of changes and restructure which can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic but far too often it seemed like these individuals assumed we were operating as normal and not realizing the difficulties and challenges we were facing.\r\n\r\n- The good worker Catch 22 problem: Over the past 2 years, Valencia (like many other places) has seen massive waves of attrition. In addition to this attrition, there were multiple occurrences of hiring freezes where positions were not refilled and as such, others had to step in as interim, or take on additional duties in order to keep things moving forward. I myself was a product of this where I served as an interim for a full time position for almost a year, but on part time hours. I did the job and did it well, but there was always an assumption from upper management and administration that myself and others like me could just chug along as normal and in some cases, didn't need to hire replacements. Trust me when I say, we were burnt out. \r\n\r\n- Loyalty from you is expected, but you get nothing in return. Myself and many others experienced this where we sacrificed ourselves to help operations only to receive nothing in return. For instance, I was primarily a part time employee and then took over an interm role of a full time job, and once finally cleared to transition to full time, was offered the minimum pay for the position. My education, experience, time, and energy to the college meant nothing in the eyes of HR. In fact the response when I brought this up was something along the lines of \"well in order to remain competitive, we start everyone off at the minimum, even if you have been here\".\r\n\r\n- Pay: In a similar vein, the pay for the institution is beyond subpar. I laughed when the HR rep said the rates are good because they are competitive. They are not even close. I just started a new position at another community college that pays over $20k more than the comparable position at Valencia. People do not get paid enough to deal with the things that occur at this institution and is a primary reason why so much good talent has left.\r\n\r\n- Growth: Valencia is a great place to start and get your foot in the door, or to finish off your career. When it comes to next steps it is extremely hard. Nepotism is a real thing and many of the positions you might be applying for already have someone in mind internally and you eventually reach a point where you have grown as much as you can, but cant move forward."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great for experience, below average pay", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Technical Support Specialist in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team, with quality fulfilling work.", "cons": "Hard to survive off of low pay.

Valencia does have some good facilities compared with other community and state colleges. The infrastructure of the college is also well run for the most part and the staff works well with the profs. If you need it, the professional development is pretty good with a wide array of courses and training. The deans are mouthpieces for the Administration and, you will find each department on each campus run differently. The bureaucratic tasks of running the day-to-day academic support of a department is farmed out to the local campuses and each department therein. Which makes the experience of each prof unique to their office and dean. Which is great if you have a competent dean, and rough if you do not.", "cons": "First, the administration is committed to keeping adjuncts saddled with low pay, little respect, and little opportunity for advancement. Expect 4-7 years of adjunct work before any real promotion opportunities. Worse for other departments.\r\nSecond, the administration is corrupt. While office politics are normal, and there is plenty within any department in any college, the scale of corruption at the Administrative level in Valencia is quite staggering. Executives and their minions are grossly over-compensated and typically are an insular and exclusive cabal within the college. There model of management is corporate and the college would love nothing more than to become a University of Phoenix for-profit run college. It is the \"model\" for growth espoused by the leadership of this college.\r\nLastly, the out of classroom facilities for adjuncts are a joke. Expect to have to meet with students in an empty classroom, the library, or a park bench. The \"faculty resource office\" in bldg 8 room 111 on the east campus is a former storage closet. It is roughly 12x14 feet and contains 5 computer stations with a printer that you have to hope has paper in it already. This is very disturbing because a plurality of contracted courses at Valencia are taught by adjuncts. \r\nI suppose I should close with this: being a prof is a great job. It is a shame that our society invests so little and forces public institutions to rely on adjuncts for their workforce. This does not excuse the gusto which Valencia has appeased the penny pinchers. With meager pay it forces adjuncts that want to be full time professional educators to find as many courses to teach. This ultimately affects our students. You cannot say that teaching five courses (normal load for tenured faculty) and teaching 9 courses at three colleges (my adjunct load last fall) amounts to the same level of commitment to our students.\r\nNext, even if you teach a higher demand discipline the prospects are not that great. If you have not secured, or even gotten to the final round of interviews for a full time position by your 4th year (your department might not even have a full-time faculty open), you should leave Valencia. One note, Valencia is set to open a downtown campus this Fall, 2019. Not only are they forcing other campuses to reduce the courses offered, but have refused to higher full-time faculty to fill these positions at this new campus. There are no signs that this will change at any point in the future as incoming Pres Plinski is cut from the same cloth as that asinine poet Shugart."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Weird policies make this not as great a place as it could be", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Lab Assistant in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great coworkers and students.

Great if you happen to be tenured faculty, not so great if you're staff or (heaven forbid) part-time staff.  Part-time staff isn't even allowed resources needed to do the job, such as an assigned work space or keys to open or lock up the area they are working in.  Teaching adjuncts aren't supposed to even get a desk/computer of their own to use, although I think most departments find ways to work around that rule. \r\n\r\nHave heard some changes that happened with the new president of the college coming in, doesn't sound promising.
