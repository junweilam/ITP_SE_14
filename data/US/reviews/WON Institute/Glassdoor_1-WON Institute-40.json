The place tries real hard to be personable.", "cons": "The President and most members of the Board of Directors are unprofessional people who have no business serving ANY role in an educational environment. The majority are Won Buddhist ministers who can't even speak English. The President is a very devout Won Buddhist who seems to make decisions with mainly Won Buddhism's interests in mind. This hurts the standing of the institute and makes for a tense and uncomfortable work experience. The President also has a talent for hiring good people but paying them poorly and treating them shabily.  She seems to believe that everyone is easily replaceable."}], [], [], []]
