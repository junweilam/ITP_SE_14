Just about everyone is fantastic.\n- Morning devotions were a great way to start the day, ensuring our minds were focused on Christ before we dove into that day's work.\n- Prayer is encouraged, either individually or in a more team setting.\n- Healthcare provided on site which was really surprising and appreciated.\n- Cafeteria food was surprisingly really great and a good price.\n- Boone is a beautiful location. The mountain summers were pleasant and the fall was gorgeous. If you like small town living, Boone and the surrounding area is a nice place to live. I grew up in the city but learned to appreciate small town living.", "cons": "- Inconsistent resistance to working remotely, which I didn't understand, especially in an age of COVID quarantines and such. \n-Not a lot of ability to promote up. Career planning felt like mostly waiting for someone above you to leave, which could take years if they're well established. Or months if they decide to leave since turnover seemed kind of high.\n- Location leaves something to be desired. Boone is a beautiful mountain town but the real estate is ridiculously expensive. You'll end up paying a lot to live close by or end up commuting 30-40 min. to pay a more reasonable rent/mortgage. \n- If you're more of a city person, there's not a lot going on in Boone. The next \"big\" town is Hickory which is about an hour away and has some decent amenities. Charlotte is 2 hours away which is where the closest international airport is. \n- Samaritan's Purse is one of the main employers in town so you'll frequently run into coworkers at church, coffee shops, etc. Could be bad or good, depending on your preference.\n- Seems like the kind of place that is best for fresh college grads, single adults, and those who've already had a full career. Not the best for families with young kids where one parent is working.\n- For such a large organization, it felt like it was still run with the mentality of a family owned business. That's fine in some respects, as you do feel close knit but I don't think it's the right management style for an organization this large."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Needs Changes", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Dec 2022", "job_title": "WASH Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They have alot of internal funds which can be used to make impact around the world.", "cons": "1) SP pays very little compared to other organization.

Amazingly, the volunteers and hourly hearts are in the right place, the SP ministry did not demonstrate  good work behavior and biblical leadership.  \r\nEveryday, the  SP staff go through all the outward Christian duties, they pray before work shift, the Champlain gives a  pep rally quick sermon.  \r\nSadly, I saw SP managers that were well paid and top heavy without a servants heart.\r\n\r\nThe facility conditions were not suitable and safe for the elderly and children.\r\nThe restrooms were located outside.  Sometimes, you could not wash your hands, because the portable potty restrooms were being service.   \r\nThey had  hourly employees working outside in 31 degree temperature in pouring rain without adequate clothing to help keep them warm.  \r\nThe SP managers assigned employees for their work shifts when they arrive to work, the parking lot employees are not given an heads up to wear warm clothing and rain gear equipment the day before. So, the parking employees working for SP were placed in unhealthy working conditions.\r\n\r\nIf you nicely question anything, and I did, the HR and managers responded with angry and rudeness.\r\n\r\nFranklin Graham should send in a undercover minister to secretly inspect the lazy warehouse managers.  \r\n\r\nPeople of God, not all ministries are bad.  \r\nSadly,  in the body of Christ, there are dysfunctional ministries.\r\nI  believe you should keep on serving and volunteering.
