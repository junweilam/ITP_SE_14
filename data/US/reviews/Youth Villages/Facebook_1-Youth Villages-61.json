When work got out that workers were trying to unionize, instead of trying to determine why, the company doubled down on an anti union campaign, spreading blatant anti-union information (some of which was downright untrue). They spread an environment of fear, which was confusing since the company touts wanting to support its employees. And what's worse, our two biggest \"customers\" (DCF and DMH) are both unionized and workers from both organizations have highlighted how much the working conditions have improved since they unionized. \n- There is literally no work life balance. Your supervisors will encourage you to maintain it but we are still expected to get everything in on time, see all of our kids, drive to and from and attend all of our meetings. It's entirely unsustainable. The turnover is absolutely absurd. I've been here less than 6 months and I've already seen 5 people from just my office leave for other opportunities because of the aforementioned issue.\n- Case loads can be absurd. We can carry up to 10 young adults in Life Set and, if you're lucky, you may only need to see them once a week but more likely than not, you'll be seeing at least half of them twice a week, meaning you somehow need to have 15 sessions a week, get your documentation and treatment plans done, attend all necessary meetings and trainings and avoid working over 40 hours a week. \n- There is not a lot of clinical skills training. They will train you how to use our intervention resource to find an intervention to use with your client but there is not training on how to implement the intervention with fidelity. The resource offers step by step instructions but for those who come from a non-clinical background, that often is not enough.\n- Our clinical judgement is often ignored. We are told to put things into our treatment plans or do things with clients that we often know are going to be triggering or unsuccessful but we are required to do so. It makes building rapport and maintaining engagement that much more difficult. \n- When it comes to diversity and inclusion, Youth Villages may talk the talk but they do not walk the walk. Upper management is overwhelming white folks, there has been an ongoing struggle to get paperwork updated to reflect the plethora of pronouns and gender identities that exist and the gate keeping that occurs around what can and cannot be discussed during \"culture crews\" is astonishing. \n- Management encourages you to bring your concerns to them but nothing gets done about them. Some managers even go as far as to say that they used to bring the same feedback to their supervisors when they were on the ground staff. And yet, nothing has been done to change any of these concerns despite their repeated occurrence."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good Company Values", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Family Intervention Specialist in Woburn, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good job first starting out", "cons": "Inconsistent management style, lots of hours, low pay."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Supervisor in Memphis, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Promotes from within, sense of pride", "cons": "I don\u2019t have any current cons"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Experience with Many Opportunities", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Residential Therapist in Bartlett, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Clinical and licensure supervision: I acquired many hours toward licensure (under contract to continue working for them until hours were paid off) and gained a lot of experience as a clinician due to the high fidelity to EBPs.\n- Great health insurance for single individuals\n- Investment into employees: licensure, tuition reimbursement, movement within agency, annual conference, COVID bonuses and raises", "cons": "Mid management can be difficult to deal with at times; the high fidelity and high expectations can create an atmosphere of micromanagement."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Room for growth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Therapist in Durham, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is a great place to start a mental health career.

Company focuses on quantity over quality of work. If you work here you will be taken advantage of. I\u2019ve spent almost the past two years here and have seen almost everyone leave. There are so many things that make this place a place you don\u2019t want to work; no work life balance, always increasing caseload (when I was hired I was told 4 cases was maximum and now the normal is 5-6 cases), youth villages prides itself on providing in home services to youth and families however the current expectation is that of the required 3 sessions a week per client only one session needs to be in person thus making it possible to carry extra cases\u2026, however if a family is at high risk or requests in person you are expected to do all sessions in person (intercept program is level D = so all cases are technically high risk), so basically you end up working at least 50 hours a week and not to mention the paperwork, some cases are super heavy with case management which is difficult to constantly stay on top of when you\u2019re having to drive all the way from Hillsboro, Gresham, lake Oswego, Milwaukee, north Portland, St. Helens, rhodendrun, sandy, se Portland, Ne Portland, sw Portland, nw Portland, forest grove, Estacada, etc, basically they tell you that that your cases will be around where you live so your driving isn\u2019t terrible and sadly that\u2019s never the case. Taking vacation is also difficult because your team is expected to carry your caseload and that\u2019s tough because you know they are also working overtime and are exhausted. The mileage pay is trash. You are also expected to have full coverage car insurance even though we don\u2019t ever drive clients. You will be expected to work when asked and cover on call weekends if people bail or leave because they are over working there. If you\u2019re trying to get experience in the social work field, go work somewhere else, this place is headed in a very bad direction and it\u2019s so hard to support your families if your company doesn\u2019t support you as an employee as well as sincerely care about each and every family that they work with. I would say that the hardest past about the job is standing up for the families, advocating for their needs and then being shut down by youth villages and not receiving any support. Don\u2019t waste your time, take your skills elsewhere and do the same job but be supported by your employer and respected by your employer because from my experience you won\u2019t get that at youth villages (maybe in the beginning but it doesn\u2019t last).

The company is not ideal for anyone that's married or in a serious relationship because the company judges their success with families by how little they use the law enforcement or have disruptions, so they do not allow counselors to call the police to assist in crisis situations (ie a client that has runaway from home, become physically aggressive with family, or is homicidal or suicidal). Due to this, counselors are often called by families to unsafe enviornments in the middle of the night with not much support. The company has many redundant meetings (around 6 hours a week to be exact) and it hinders the counselors from doing their jobs effectively. The promotions in the company do not correlate with your education or experience  because someone with a Masters degree and much experience can be supervised by someone with a Bachelor degree just because they have been with the company longer. The company will usually only place 4 clients at a time on a counselor during their first year, but will increase their work load significantly after they have been there over a year; however overtme is not given because it has to be requested ahead of time, but you do not know when a crisis will happen, so you can never get it approved ahead of time!"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Like Cattle to the Slaughter House so I worked at YV", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Feb 2013", "job_title": "Bilingual Family Intervention Specialist in Woburn, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Compensation was not bad for a first job.

NOTHING, they will confirm that you worked there and what role was defined by them. NOTHING! If asked why: company policy.

I think that the YV concept is good but just poorly executed.  They want clinicians to be on-call 24 hours a day and some on weekends.  I would here my phone ring even when I was not on-call. How appropriate is it.   I have responded but lacked the training to provide adequate, appropriate crisis interventions.   Trainings were mostly in house going over policies.

It conflicts with most of the things you've learned in life and in school but you have to buy in or you're an outcast. \r\n\r\nIf you're a natural expressive person, you probably won't fit it unless you're white.

They \"solved\" the problem by telling the all white management about the reports who were \"appalled \" because they have black friends or date black guys. Then management decided that reading a book that has nothing to do with cultural or race would help.

Its really hard to draw the line with what should be allowed and what is allowed. The rules in place don't make sense and that's why there is so much push back from the kids. I honestly felt bad for the kids because I could never explain to them why things happened because that's just \"how it is\" and I had no say in the rule changes, which made it more difficult as well. \r\n\r\n-Higher management is out of touch with how the milieu should be run. The schedules were ridiculous half the time and had activities that did not reflect the kids interests. \r\n\r\n-The therapists barely saw the kids, maybe once or twice a week. The communication between therapists and counselors was poor. I was told it wasn't my place to teach kids de-escalation techniques and coping skills- that was the therapist's job. One problem though- one session a week isn't really going to teach kids anything, especially if the counselors don't know whats going on in that session. I would have liked to know what I could do to help the kids cope. Having that communication sure would have helped...\r\n\r\n-Treatment 'team'. I barely felt like we were a 'team'. Lack of communication between therapists, supervisor/managers and counselors was a rampant issue, which made it difficult to feel like a unified team. I felt very disconnected."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "STAY ON TOP OF THINGS!!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Columbus, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Gain a lot of knowledge in this field.\r\nBuild positive relationships with external customers such as probation officers, dcf, or court staff.\r\nCreate your own schedule weekly (Flexible schedule as needed)\r\nWork alone most of the time.", "cons": "Not enough support from management \r\nNo stability\r\nNo structure\r\nLack of communication\r\nNo foundation within the office."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "STAY ON TOP OF THINGS!!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Columbus, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Gain a lot of knowledge in this field.\r\nBuild positive relationships with external customers such as probation officers, dcf, or court staff.\r\nCreate your own schedule weekly (Flexible schedule as needed)\r\nWork alone most of the time.", "cons": "Not enough support from management \r\nNo stability\r\nNo structure\r\nLack of communication\r\nNo foundation within the office."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great experience, but this type of job is not for just anyone", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Licensure supervision offered\r\nTuition reimbursement for taking classes\r\nSalary increases at 1 year and 2 year benchmark\r\nStipend for weekend and weekday on calls now (before it was all unpaid)\r\nMileage reimbursement higher than other non-profits\r\nWorking with youths\r\nGreat experience to be gained\r\nFlexible hours", "cons": "This job is definitely very challenging and not for everyone.

First, they will hire almost anyone with a bachelor's degree in a social services field and about 6 months of some kind of experience. Secondly, it is nice to make your own schedule. Third, I would say that direct supervisors (clinical supervisors) are just as bitter as the counselors, so they can be pretty easy to talk to.\r\nThe biggest pro would be the kids that you get to work with. Some of them absolutely stole my heart, and it honestly may be the most intrinsically rewarding thing I've done.", "cons": "There are several things wrong with this organization. \r\n\r\nFirst, I would tell various supervisors that a client would have maybe met for 30 minutes. The majority of these supervisors would ask something along the lines of \"Are you sure that it wasn't closer to 45?\" WE WERE NEVER DIRECTLY TOLD TO COMMIT FRAUD. Many times, at least in the Johnson City location, we would be told to complete phone sessions if we couldn't meet in person, though upper management would take action if this was discovered. I entered a note once in our system, quoting the therapist of one of my clients. I was told I needed to change the note and upper management provided me with the direct wording, even though she was not there at the time of my session.\r\n\r\nSecond, the organization is up front about their schedules, stating that the counselors are on call starting 8am Monday to 5pm Friday, and rotating weekends. Transitional Living has to see their clients once a week, unless otherwise stated by the clinical leadership and Family Intervention Specialists (IHS) sees their families 3 times per week. Also, on the website when looking to apply (at least in my case), it states that the case load for both of these positions are 7-9 clients and 4-6 clients, respectively. What they DON'T mention is the high intensity cases that have to be seen more than these allotted times. There were many times when I was carrying a case load of 8 in IHS, and 12-13 for TL, seeing many of them more than their once a week session. Supervisors did not offer to help see our clients and expected our paperwork to be in regardless of emergencies that happened. Not only this, but the number of times you get called out for \"emergencies\" since you are on call. A coworker of mine literally drove to a client's house every day of the week, sometimes twice a day, because of an emergency with a family. Supervisors are supposed to conduct face-to-face \"leadership field visits\" with a certain number of clients on their team, but this rarely happened even with emergencies.\r\n\r\nClinical Leadership at Youth Villages is horrible. There are two, fairly redundant meetings that counselors have to attend each week. \"Group\" is where the supervisor and her team meet, review cases, and the supervisor provides direction. \"Consult\" is where the supervisor and her group meet with the clinical consultant (for many regions by phone as not every program has a consultant for their office) and the consultant provides additional feedback, if there is any. These meetings are typically held on two different days, at different times. Sometimes they are combined, with the consultant joining the first meeting and adding input. Also, the credibility of some of management is questionable. There was at one point a bachelor-level supervisor providing clinical direction to someone with a master's and licensure out of one of the offices. Also, while there are some aspects of counseling in what TL does, the majority of the work can be described as case management, yet some of the upper management that provides clinical direction is licensed with their LPC, not LCSW.\r\n\r\nAs I said on the pro's list, direct supervisors are a good ear to complain to, but they never really help, mostly out of fear of retaliation from upper management. In fact, there were many times I questioned the direction provided by upper management, but was told I needed to be quiet because it would impact my chances at promotion. Many times when I had an emergency out of the Knoxville office, i would be with my supervisor. Protocol was that she needed to call her upper management for direction. There was a day when two members of upper management were talking in an office when I had an emergency. My supervisor called several times, twice we looked around the corner as we called and both times she picked up the phone to see who was calling, hit ignore, and put it back down on her desk. My supervisor felt totally helpless because she did not feel as if she could complain to another member of upper management; the person she needed to speak to was the other person visiting with her supervisor. She felt totally helpless and it was not the only time that it happened with these two members of upper management.\r\n\r\nOver the course of my employment, I had two members of my immediately family pass away. When my dad passed away, there was a lot of late paperwork on my end that was late.After returning from the annual YV conference and the funeral, I sat down with my supervisor, who told me that I would have been written up for my late paperwork but I would be excused because my dad died. When my gram was in hospice right before her passing, I drove up to Ohio on a Friday, and then finished the drive on Saturday. She passed after I arrived in Michigan. My supervisors were informed every step of the way, even when she died my supervisor was one of the first people I texted. I received a long text from my supervisor (this time a different one) on Monday, while I was at my gram's funeral, that told me I did not have an excuse for my late paperwork this time as it was due on Friday before my gram died. She told me that I needed to get it in that day or be written up.\r\n\r\nHR, in general, was decent. However, there were several employees in HR that could not respond to e-mails, which made problems with my insurance even more difficult. When I first started, I was hired on as \"pilot,\" which meant I carried a partial case load until I got my feet on the ground. Pilot employees are not eligible for insurance, and at Youth Villages you have to sign up for insurance within your first 90 days. We e-mailed our HR contact several times and she never responded. When the Fall came around, there was an employee contest for the annual \"Staying Fit and Loving It\" challenge. Every year the first bonus is earned by completing a health assessment on the insurance website. Again I tried to e-mail my HR contact...my supervisor tried...but it was not until a coworker e-mailed her, asking what I should do to participate, that she wrote back. She told us that everyone should have insurance, whether it is through YV or a spouse. I replied to her, and explained my situation, and also explained to her that due to my affectional orientation, I was not allowed to marry. Upon asking for further direction, she never responded.\r\n\r\nThis was not the only time that Youth Villages caused troubles with my insurance. When upper management in Knoxville filed the paperwork to have me \"transferred\" to the Johnson City office, I was instead terminated. I discovered this and was put back into the system, but it was not until a few months later that I discovered they had not reinstated my insurance. I wrote back, asking them to reimburse me, as I had been paying for insurance out of every paycheck. They refused to repay me, and instead back-dated my coverage, stating that this was in case I had any pre-existing conditions. I informed them that I did not, but they would not reimburse me for the 3 months I was not covered. When I left the organization at the beginning of February 2014, my supervisors informed me that my insurance would be good until the end of the month. The following week I tried to order contacts, but my insurance had been canceled. The office supervisor for Johnson City instructed me to write to our HR contact, so I did. But I did not hear anything back. So my insurance was cut off twice during my employment at Youth Villages, which led me to miss out on health and vision coverage that I needed, even though payments were taken out of my check. I also never received the COBRA information that was supposed to be sent.\r\n\r\nYV, at the time I left, was paying either $0.44 or $0.42 per mile. This is pretty far below the suggested rate of $0.55. Many of the employees have difficulties paying for gas up front each month, as the reimbursement is not distributed until the second paycheck of each month. They also (sometimes) reimburse you for food if you are paying for food for kids. It really depends. Knoxville staff were not typically reimbursed after paying for meals for clients, but Johnson City staff were. These clients I am talking about are minors, being transported across the state. Clients from Memphis told me numerous times that they were not allowed to have snacks, and that staff would not stop for food on trips from Memphis, sometimes all the way to Cookeville or Knoxville. Knoxville staff was allowed to buy food for these clients, but were not reimbursed for it. \r\n\r\nIt takes a psychological toll. Any social services job does. A coworker had a client who was killed while on her caseload. She was given a day or two off and was offered counseling. A client of mine tried to commit suicide. I sat for 8 hours in the hospital with him...watched him intubated, watched the hospital staff put coal on the lips to induce vomiting. I had to be at the hospital at 11 the next morning when he woke up. The next day he was discharged and I did not find out until the following week. I was not offered a day off or any counseling. \r\n\r\nThe last thing I can think of is the compensation. There is rarely a time where employees work less than 40 hours a week, but employees are salaried and do not receive over time. I started out at 26k and ended at 33k 3 years later. I did not think this was too bad, but for the weeks that I worked 60 hours or more, my compensation came out to be less than minimum wage per hour.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have noticed about the positive reviews for YV on this site is that the majority of them come from management, and many of them come from employees that are still employed there. If considering a job at Youth Villages, please pay attention to who did the review.\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\nAlso, Youth Villages provides benefits to spouses of same-sex partners, but a coworker struggled for weeks to get her partner on under her coverage. She printed off the email chains and showed them to me, and expressed her dissatisfaction that many of her other heterosexual coworkers did not have to go through this struggle. She did eventually obtain insurance for her and her spouse. Also, being a gay man, I never felt at ease or comfortable. I wrote to HR at the beginning of my employment regarding my feelings of discrimination. When I left, I was the only openly gay male in any of the East TN offices, though there were many open lesbians in my office (one had been written up several times for the same accusations brought up against me once)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Avoid like the plague!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Arlington, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good for your resume.

They had us sign a contract or we would be terminated on the spot.  Part of the contract included a \"floating work week.\"  This allows them to pay you 1/2 pay for overtime.  YES.  HALF PAY.  If you make $10/hr.  You get paid $5/hr for overtime.  I asked if this was legal, and was told yes bc of the \"floating work week.\"  FWW states if you are roughly an hour or 2 short on your paycheck, they will go ahead and pay you for the full 40.  However, they have weekly meetings that last an hour, that is not factored into your work week.  So, you are scheduled to work at least 41 hours, receiving half pay for that hour.  Also, every shift is scheduled 8.5 hours, to allow a 30 minute break.  You might average 1 break every 2 weeks, due to understaffing.  Now, you have 2 hours of overtime, at half pay.  All while not receiving a break.  You see the talk about management.  It is true.  There is a \"management clique\" and if you aren't in it, you will not get promoted.  They are complete tools.  They would sit outside of the main entrance, to the side where there's a patio area, and compare their new shoes.  Anyone who has worked there can verify.  I worked there for over 5 years and worked all shifts.  All shifts are understaffed.  One night we only had one person for each unit.  Which is a ratio of 1:10 - 12.  Law requires 1:8 during 3rd shift, 1:5 on 1st and 2nd shift.  This was not a one time occurrence.  Just so happened on this night there was an issue on one of the units and \"all staff available\" was called over radios.  Two of us had nurses cover our units to assist.  There were no supervisors scheduled (dumbfounding), and we could not get in touch with them.  We called the police due to kids beginning to get ready to riot.  This is not made up.  When I started day shift, we had 5 T/C's.  2 for each unit and 1 to float where needed as kids were vary volatile.  The floater ended up moving and leaving the company.  He was never replaced, and we were pretty much told that bc we did such a good job, he never would be.  Yet, there was no compensation sent our way even though our work quality was saving them around 25k a year.  Bc we were understaffed, I was able to get a vacation for 6 months.  At YV, you \"cap out\" at a certain amount of vacation time.  Meaning if your max is 120 hours, you cannot accrue any more until you have used some.  I was capped and denied multiple vacation days due to, \"Not having staff to cover it.\"  So, I am working harder, due to understaffing.  And I can't get a vacation to recover, due to understaffing.  See a pattern here?  I put in for a week of vacation in June.  I put the request in at the beginning of March.  3 months for mgmt to plan the schedule.  I reminded every two weeks for the first 2 months, and then every week the month after.  I was told I would not receive one day due to not having enough staff.  The understaffing causes safety concerns as well.  You can legally be left with 5 kids by yourself.  You call for assistance, and there is not enough staff to help you bc they are engaged in a different crisis.  I am 6'1 240lbs.  I was able to handle most incidents with only one other staff.  However, there were times I made an \"emergency\" call over the radio, and it took more than 10 minutes to get help.  Some of these kids are my size or larger.  The CEO is a tool.  He sends emails about how they are buying more facilities, but they were on a \"raise freeze\" for over 2 years.  The only reason I stayed as long as I did were my coworkers (non-mgmt).  \r\n\r\nWhen I resigned, start pay was 9/hr.

The children are horrible and there isn't really much help that Youth Villages can do for them besides give them a bed to sleep on and food on the table. I've seen plenty of kids come back after finishing \"treatment\". I've also seen some kids improve so it's somewhat beneficial for the smaller kids who still have hope. The kids will eat you alive if you're the passive type. I've seen staff get beat up and seriously injured because of the kids trying to fight them or even when restraining them. The kids are manipulative and very disrespectful, some are potentially dangerous and should be at a REAL treatment facility or even juvenile detention. Management is a joke, you better hope you get lucky and get someone who is supportive because then you're left to dry and thrown under the bus. Supervisors are incompetent because all they do is fill in positions because the turnover rate is so high. The company shows favortism and is very unprofessional.

Middle and upper management will attempt to convince you that your job is worth suffering for and that you aren't a team player or committed to helping others if you attempt to create a healthy work/life balance. Many of the positive reviews about the company have been asked for by upper management, hence they often have little depth to them. \r\n\r\n-Redundant/ Pointless Paperwork: As a clinician I am a huge fan of proper documentation, but Youth Villages takes it to an all new extreme. Most of the forms you will spend hours filling out do nothing to further your work with the families and are completely unnecessary. Treatment plans are not supposed to change EVERY WEEK. They are a general clinical roadmap of your work, I would be highly alarmed if someone I was supervising needed to completely redraft a treatment plan after every second or third session...I'd be fearful that they were rushing through and doing poor work or, even worse, didn't know what they were doing at all. \r\n\r\n-No Real Supervision/ No Growth as  Therapist: If you just graduated a program in Social Work, Counseling, or Psychology this is not the place to go if you want to grow as a clinician. What you will be forced to do will look like basic life-skills training, not therapy. The people supervising you, who've spent their entire careers at YV, will not be able to make you a better therapist. They will only make you better-should you survive the long hours- at filing out mountains of pointless paperwork and following a watered down \"treatment manual\". In short, they can't teach you what they don't know themselves. \r\n\r\n-Promotions Are Rarely About Quality: I did see a former colleague get promoted to supervisor after I left the company, and she's probably one of the few qualified and compassionate supervisors on the entire Indiana team. Mostly, though? Promotions were given to people who would suck up to management or wear the \"Youth Villages Face\", many of them are not from clinical fields or backgrounds and should not be managing masters level clinicians. \r\n\r\n-The Youth Villages Face: If you take a job with YV you had better wear this at all times. What do I mean? If you are having a hard day...hide it. If the work is burning you out...don't let management see it.  If you are fed up with the constant, toxic stream of YV propaganda and unfair policies...keep it to yourself. All of these things can get you blacklisted in office politics which means you'll be the first one on call for holidays or when the supervisor's favorite doesn't want to do his or her work, or when some inconvenient or unpleasant task needs to be done. Not wearing the YV face will cause middle and upper management to behave very negatively towards you and, believe me, being alienated at work when you already don't have time for a life outside of work will burn you out very quickly."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "In home counselor", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Senior Family Counselor in Morristown, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good training for future employments.

The brain knows the hours are 24 hrs on call and the first complaint become \"I am not paid for 24 hrs on call.\"  Because most employees are \"straight\" out of college, they have the resources to see 35k as enough and the experiences gained as solid concrete for their resumes and fresh experiences to build on.

I \"use\" the company to hide from a personal life and then complain about salary and lack of time off to build on to have such a person at home.  I see the paradox.  The complaint shows what I am really unhappy about:  I don't have someone at home to use with my boss to say 'I demand a work-life home balabnce,'  and they know I don't have kids so there again it doesn't have a weight.  I love my co-workers, but they also became a way to use people and be used.  My strong identity as a Christian is a valued part of our conversations, but not my partner.  So, I lie about this, too.  I say it's for them, but really it's me 'playing the game' for my professional commitment to outdo any other human need I have and lacks a maturity to think my co-workers would value this part of me and nourish me in it, as much as discussions of church do.  \r\n\r\nYouth Villages uses us for our 'do good' identities as Christians and Catholics, but the other ethnic identities go unspoken.  I used them to be in an in-home environ and to test the limits of my commitment to children and families in need, but found myself lately complaining about money and my welfare, as opposed to citing that this is the issue completely.  It's welfare (for others) and not my social life that needs to be tended to.  Because I am not out of the closet, so what do I mean when I say \"work-life balance needs to be changed so I have time off.\"  The company, in turn, leverages my desire to 'feel good, doing social work'  against me by asking me 'how can you ask for time to your life, when your life is not as important as a heterosexual, married, white male?,\"  or \"how can you ask for a work-life balance when you are a good Christian/Catholic who is here to serve others through you and your sacrifice?\"  They ask this silently, of course.  My love for for a social environ at work confuses the issues, too.  We should return to the idea of welfare and find companies who serve all of our identities properly, as women, as those with ethnic diversities that require care, and as those who are Christians/Catholics (etc) inside careers in welfare and not *use* these companies to further holes we have inside from a lack therein.  \r\n\r\nThe loss of having a smart company behind me (or alongside me) is great.  I learned the lesson the hard way:  mutual respect and a non \"use me/I'll use you\" experience serves short-terms gains only and causes avoidance, stress, and lost resources for myself and clients.  When companies put the abstract principles before the need to have them realized in experience and concrete contracts of mutuality, these losses to our clients and ourselves build to erode the company itself.  The reviews of Youth Villages show it to be \"average\"  because the company wants to stay \"average.\"  Which means to keep an eye on myself for how \"average\"  I am or want to be.  Our work and experience with each other - even virtually - is contracted.  These contracts serve who we are and how we become.  But, as soon as an imbalance is noted, the brain knows and tries to rebalance it.  In my case, a smart company removed the choice for me.
