This facility cares nothing about seeing your a T. New management that is been brought in in recent years feels that the older employees are a weight and burden that the facility must eliminate in order to grow and prosper. They don\u2019t take into consideration the fact that these senior employees are the backbone of the facility and are the ones that built SGMC into what once was a great place to receive quality, patient centered care, And it was a great place to work even though they never quite could get the salary situation taken care of.\n4. Job security doesn\u2019t exist! Example: if someone in upper management such as a department director or supervisor does not like you or for whatever reason feels that you don\u2019t fit in the organization the way they think you should fit into the organization they will work tirelessly to remove you from the organization.  They will take policies and procedures and twist and turn and burn them to create whatever is necessary to scrape you off of SGMC\u2019s payroll.
