Expect a less than $1 pay raise if you get promoted but also expect ypur workload to double, even triple with hardly no recognition or adequate compensation. Instead, you get criticism and pressure. You will also stay at that measly pay rate and be told to be grateful for what you have, and that you are making the most you can ever make when you ask about an annual, cost of living raise. Management will micromanage you to the point of exhaustion and only care about their \"image\" and how good they look to ELT (Executive Leadership Team).

They do not recognize diplomas, education, or experience - at a detriment to their clients. They frequently refer to clients as \"entitled\" \"borderlines\" and/or \"schizophrenics\" it was upsetting as persons with mental health concerns are not their diagnosis and first person language needs to return as a fundamental level of human right in the human service field that they portend to offer. \r\n\r\nVMH has HORRID health plans - they are really not health plans. For physical health the deductible is $1,500 to $3,000 a year and RX are not covered. They offer an HSA then fail to deposit monies into the accounts, monies that you ask to be put into accts and \"gifts\" of deposit that they offer and promise to employees. As well, they do not appear to pay out on their wellness plans - If you fax any paperwork to admin \"it gets lost\" it seems that since there is only two people in the payroll and benefit department that they may just throw away papers to avoid being drowned by working with over 900 employees. As well, the average employee only makes about eleven dollars and fourteen cents an hour and up to fourteen dollars. If you are a contract worker or a therapist, you make more but still the pay is minimal and the work expectations are such that it is once again theft due to potential reporting of time \r\n\r\nThere is a review on here about discord among employees and other things and they are correct - however I was never encouraged or advised to use meds that dropped on the floor and if I was I would never support that.
