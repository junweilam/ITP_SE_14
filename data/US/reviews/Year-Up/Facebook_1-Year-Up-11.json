And when I say a handful, it\u2019s literally five. Every single person at a site and region could align and when the suggestion reaches the handful it\u2019s shot down. But the people at the individual contributor levels are held accountable. It\u2019s such a flattened matrix that no one knows what the own, drive, lead, decide. So it takes forever to get \u201caligned\u201d before you can even send recommendations up to the handful for rejection. \r\n\r\nCompensation philosophy- let\u2019s just say there isn\u2019t one until functions revolt and then magically peoples salaries are changed. Not to mention the free labor, modern day slavery,\r\npromoted by hiring MSW interns with no compensation but having them manage a caseload to support retention metrics. \r\n\r\nInfrastructure and Integrity- LACKING. They laid off 20% of staff only to back door and hire new people. And black men were the largest group laid off at a social impact organization. No transparency in the decision making at all. And since the RIFF has hired back the exact quantity of roles at more senior levels. Frauds! Regional structure is not clearly defined, multiple roles in the highest compensated function, Corporate Engagement, mostly employed by white men and women, with no clear impact or accountability. Growth strategy is chaotic and driven by money and market share, not balanced with staff and student experience and outcomes. \r\n\r\nCulture- I saved the worst CON for last but believe me it\u2019s the absolute WORST. Driven by white dominant culture- they want it fast and perfect from all the black and brown staff as directed by white staff. Under the guise of being the experts in attracting, retaining, and advancing black and brown talent, this org has no clue how to do it for their own staff, let alone students. Up until 1 month ago the entire Exec team were white, older, men. Additionally, some of the most extreme racially charged comments I\u2019ve ever heard were said here at this company and HR did nothing. It\u2019s a revolving door. No one stays in the role over 12 months so everyone is always as scrambling for coverage to support students. This culture is CULT like and a consensus culture. Group think is encouraged and rewarded. The student recruitment teams are so stressed to meet metrics they literally go and pull young people off the bus stops, out of mental institutes, and even from their parents death beds to start the program. \r\nAll DEI work is performative. And when you share feedback to exec leadership you\u2019re reminded to adhere to the company\u2019s core values. How about you lead with your own values and hold your leaders to those blues instead of muting the voice and experience of your staff? And be prepared to work a minimum of 50-60 hours per week. And your manager to placate you by sharing they work the same amount of hours. No work life balance. They want you to work while you have COVID, work and check emails on PTO. Folks will call and email you while you\u2019re on vacation, at the hospital, funeral, graduation- it doesn\u2019t matter because everything is urgent."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Not a bad place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent benefits and allows you to use your strengths while being mission oriented", "cons": "The numbers can matter more than the kids sometimes"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Organization on the decline", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Operations", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The mission and helping participants achieve their goals.", "cons": "Working at Year Up has changed so much in recent times.

For me, frustration began to occur when ideas, suggestions, & solutions to the daily conundrums that would arise were discounted. Year Up wants you to spend hours at a time with members of the NATL. team who, quite frankly, were under qualified in varied areas & out of touch w/ the realities of the program at the local level. In many, if not every instance, the NATL. teams would hold frequent ZOOM & SKYPE meetings that were dressed up as collaborative efforts, however, it was nothing more than a share-out session where the Senior leaders of specific functions would glean information to nauseam from local level employees. The only thing upper management would bring to the table were corny warm up questions that, if you didn't buy into, would get you slighted from any sort of recognition for actual accomplishments. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Year Up fails to hold many of its Caucasian Managers accountable for poor leadership, failed metrics, and unhappy employees under their guidance who've taken the necessary steps to report their disappointing experience. Also & unfortunately, I've seen numerous employees of color work in silence because they know that reporting actual thoughts and feelings to the majority, white management & decision makers may result in retaliation and an unpleasant work experience. Conversely, I've seen numerous employees of color conform to a culture that forces you into what Caucasians deem to be the standard of professionalism. That, more than anything, saddened me. \r\n\r\nLastly, the pay for local level employees who are overworked can only be described as abysmal, especially in comparison to the salaries of members on the NATL. team & the frivolous spending the organization has done."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing company to learn investments operations", "cons": "Nothing to complain for now"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great company but tons of work and no compensation", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Aug 2021", "job_title": "IT Support Specialist in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture and environment is great and there are tons of opportunities to learn.

It is assumed now that the students are no longer first priority, but rather the bottom line, and if you fall on out of the executive director's good graces, for whatever arbitrary reason, your tenure is going to be miserable. There have been innumerable conversations worthy of lawsuits behind closed doors that further demean staff members and make them fearful of their jobs or abilities to progress within the organization. The executive director came into the site and without bothering to learn the culture commandeered the office and made arbitrary changes without regard for the staff who served the longest. It was clear how people felt when the longest-tenured staff began to make their exit plans quickly and unhesitatingly. We often refer to it as the \"Guy show\" as no matter the context, the executive director felt that the office catered to her whim and fancy, often commandeering rooms and entire functions regardless of context, often speaking without the grounding in the core values that staff members and students hold so dear, changing direction without bothering to gather any input, again regardless of the institutional knowledge surrounding her. It became clear if you were not on the Senior Leadership Team, your input was not only not valued, but not wanted at all. If it was heard, it was summarily disregarded. It continues to be disheartening to hear how unhappy everyone is and dejected they are to walk into the office every day. It used to be a magical place to work, now it is a belittling experience that has pushed the best people out or as close to the door as possible and unfortunately, seems to be accepted as part of the natural process of change management.

Even on days that the work was tough, I was always happy to walk into the building and be surrounded by such a hardworking group of staff and students. \r\n\r\nThe students are incredible, too. While not all 90 students are life-changing, it is quite likely that you will meet a lot of people that you connect with deeply every new six month recruiting cycle. I was a coach of up to 9 students at one point, and working with all of them was such a joy, even if not all of them were successful. I was happy to take late night phone calls, text thoroughly, and answer any question I could - or direct them to someone who could - because of how compelling all of the students were. The students are also incredibly appreciative of the work that you do for them; it's possible that you're the first person to stick your neck out for them in a long time if not ever.\r\n\r\nWhile the work can be really challenging - I would have to \"fire\" 3-5 students every six months, many of whom that process is extremely devastating - you're surrounded by so much to feel great about.\r\n\r\nI had people who cared about me on staff, some of whom were helpful in moving my career along. While I didn't connect super closely with my first manager, she was incredibly skillful and I learned a lot from her. I was much closer with my second manager, but didn't find him to be very supportive.\r\n\r\nOh, I forgot! the benefits are incredible. Almost enough to offset a very meager salary.", "cons": "Year Up has a few separate components: there's program (which encompasses the entire student experience, from recruitment - employment placement), operations (which runs the staff management and building operations), development (fundraising), and corporate engagement (who bring in internship and hiring partners). Depending on where you are in the organization likely goes a long way in determining how long you can last there. My role was designed to sit in-between the interns and the corporate partners. Sometimes, I would suggest that a student should be fired for poor attendance/performance, others I would advocate for the student to get more support. However, to be doing that means that there's a constant tension and fight about what to do best for the students and the company. If we keep letting a low-performing student go to internship, we risk alienating the partner. If we fire a student too quickly, we lose a possible positive outcome, so there is a tricky balance. However, Corporate Engagement will almost always win these fights and there's not much you can do about it from a Program side of things. Because the site runs on the dollars generated by internships, people will always pull the trigger really quickly on a low-performing student even when there's an opportunity to turn things around.\r\n\r\nThe promotion/talent evaluation process is two-tiered and shockingly political. The first component is a 360 evaluation, where you choose people that you work with to review you. Your manager reads the reviews of your 360 reviews and then  offers their own commentary and assigns you a 1-5 grade. I have never heard of anyone getting a 5, and I've only heard of a single 1. In order to get promoted, I was told that I had to get a 4 on a review (or at least I was told that it was really important for that to happen). However, there wasn't really a method to demonstrate that people are worthy of a 4. Sure, there were objective metrics to hit, and a vague thing called \"competencies,\" but in many cases there was an extreme overlap between a 3 and a 4. In addition, there was an unspoken rule among staff where you wouldn't actually choose people that you worked with, you would just choose people who would give you the highest reviews. I, naively, did not do this, and found a lot of my review tarnished by people referencing disagreements that we had (remember, our roles exist in tension?) as an indicator of poor performance, as opposed to actually measuring the quality of my work.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that Year Up should automatically promote every well performing employee - that would be impractical and not cost effective. After all, this is a non-profit in Seattle. However, most promotions went to Development, Corporate Engagement, and white men. This created a quasi-caste system, where program staff would wind up making considerably less than their corporate-facing partners and the latter would flex their title and power on the program team. Year Up, of course, because they mean well, would bring in racial diversity speakers designed to help support the staff, but the people who really needed to be hearing the conversations (the Executive Director, the senior staff member who called Belltown \"dangerous\" after one of our students got arrested, and many others) wouldn't actually be there, leaving us to do the \"important\" work. Another time, we were teaching staff members how to facilitate because we noticed that there had been a struggle the previous cohort for what to do when facilitation went wrong. All of the staff members who attended that training were on the program team, while the \"important\" staff members left and did other things and didn't end up using our skills that we were training them on."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great mission, great benefits, PD funds are great and can use up to $1,000 of PD funds for student loan repayment.

The rapid organizational growth creates a lot of opportunities for taking on new challenges in your role or outside of it. \r\n\r\nI also think leadership here has a real commitment to core values. I've seen some discussion on Glassdoor about diversity in leadership and hiring. Year Up definitely struggles in this area, as most companies do, but I've been heartened by how seriously everyone in the organization takes efforts to build a diverse team. Most of us only see the person hired at the end of a search and not the process that led to that hire; whenever I've been part of that process there has always been a very serious consideration of diversity and efforts to attract a diverse pool of applicants. I think it's to leadership's credit that at the end of the day, the best candidate is selected and there are no shortcuts being taken to achieve diversity goals. There is certainly a lot of work to be done here, but I see a very sincere effort being made. And I see that same depth of commitment to all of the stated core values.", "cons": "1.

Year Up has even taking a step to try to make those leaders be more comfortable with feedback by choosing to make an additional set of feedback guidelines. Many staff also don't always support the students as they should be. These young adults are joining this program to learn and many of the experiences they have in the program are new  to them. Staff make comments that students shouldn't questions they things they do because \"they have jobs and earn a paycheck verses a stipend\", that is completely unacceptable and inappropriate.  Gerald wants alumni to one day run Year Up including being the CEO. However the reality of this dream  will never happen because everyone does not share his same thoughts and feelings. Year Up alumni are often stuck in coordinator and specialist level roles with a few that are in the manager band. Alumni are often given feedback that while they do a good job in their work, the ratings received in their annual reviews do not match what is being told to them or in some cases not told. It's extremely hard to grow in Year Up because the feedback that is often presented in interviews is that you are great but we will go with another candidate that has more experience.  Who would have more experience at being a Program Manager than someone who has lived out the student contract. When people raise concerns to the national office the complaints fall upon deaf ears. The organization is extremely reactive when it comes to  being forward thinking  about growth.

Senior leaders rarely listen to the experiences of students or employees who come from the communities they are trying to serve to better understand how to serve all students. They would also oftentimes back their corporate partners over their own students to preserve relationships, ie if a student encountered verifiably racist speech or practices by their co-workers at internship, the organization would tell students to tough it out and that this came with working in the private sector. Year Up claims to have solved how to educate and employ low-income individuals, but there are large sections of that population, such as extremely low income, homeless, young parents, and formerly incarcerated people, that Year Up rarely accepts themselves.

Many of the negative comments here are correct .  Much discrimination and reverse discrimination in an organization that supposedly promotes the opposite. \r\n\r\nIf you have ever worked for another non-profit, you will see what I big joke this one is.  If you have worked in the non-profit sector before, don\u2019t come here.  You will be disappointed and told you are over qualified and cannot relate to the population. It will be the same if you have any sort of teaching experience and you are hired as an instructor. \r\n\r\nI had a 15 minute interview and was hired without much information.  They expected me to start very quickly (usually a red flag for bad employers who cannot plan their staffing needs according and/or turnoff good \r\ncandidates/employees with bad management behavior.)  Another reason for much turn-over here.   \r\n\r\nAlso, one is expected to be a counselor/social worker to people in the program in addition the endless list of other staff duties. Given the underserved population of Year-up, if they want a social worker, they should hire them not expect instructors and other office staff to provide such skilled services with no training (all the while being scolded for their inability to do so.)\r\n\r\nYou are also expected to participate in ALL team-building activities with the students\u2026at the expense of your regular work.  Such team building activities are essentially Summer Camp events in Wall Street attire since everyone must meet dress code all the time. This dress code is fine if they apply it to all staff as well as students or don\u2019t expect you to be in nice clothes and crawling on the dirty stained floor or doing athletic maneuvers.  Do not criticize students for inappropriate attire when a long-time staff member dresses like a street walker in Pioneer Square or pick on a staff member for wearing a plain T-shirt with a blazer and dress pants.\r\n\r\nGood benefits, but you are scorned if you use them.
