UAGC expects miracles to be performed and for us to enroll and retain these people who have ZERO intention and ZERO business trying to attend an online university! \r\n\r\nThey\u2019re either TikTok grant chasers: \u201cYea, how do I get that grant? I need to pay my rent and car note.\u201d \r\n\r\nAre coming out of prison: \u201cI paid my dues to society, and I want to do better, but I have no computer skills, no stable living environment, and no computer.\u201d \r\n\r\nActively using substances: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \r\n\r\nHave zero computer skills: \u201cWhat\u2019s a URL?\u201d \r\n\r\nHomeless: \u201cI\u2019m not sure where I\u2019ll be living next week, but yea let\u2019s get me enrolled!\u201d \r\n\r\nPipe dreamers: \u201cI want the degree so badly, but (insert a million excuses).\u201d \r\n\r\nHave fake high-school diplomas: \u201cClick.\u201d \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t have computers: \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to use that grant money to buy a computer.\u201d \r\n\r\nAnd yet UAGC threatens enrollment advisors for not being able to enroll these people?! Are you serious?! \r\n\r\nHow much is UAGC paying for these \u201cquality\u201d leads? $50 for 200 leads?! No, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more like $97 for 345, right? Whatever they\u2019re paying for these leads, it\u2019s not enough. \r\n\r\nAnd leadership is well aware! But, rather than pay for quality leads or, I don\u2019t know, implement resources that will assist their enrollment advisors, actually ENROLL quality students, such as a laptop program or a basic computer course (because, let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re already a Devry or UOP with all of their lawsuits, so they may as well go the full throttle); they instead choose to belittle enrollment advisors and use us as scapegoats!!! \r\n\r\nStop gaslighting people who have good work ethics because you refuse to pay for quality leads!!! These leads are crap!!! And again, leadership is well aware!  What kills me is the fact that these managers wouldn\u2019t even be able to convert and retain these people either, yet, they are consistently dangling termination in front of our faces. Lol. \r\n\r\n9/10 of the prospects are coming out of prison, have fake high school diplomas, no computers, and only talk to us because TikTok tells them they\u2019ll get a grant that same day. How dare UAGC use your employees as scapegoats. And don\u2019t get me started on the fact that enrollment advisors must also act as financial aid advisors in assisting these prospects with their financial aid documents, which you\u2019ve guessed it takes an immense amount of time away from actual enrollment activities that we\u2019re later held accountable for!\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, leaders then have the AUDACITY to berate employees in front of other employees in stitch meetings\u2014shame on you, UAGC. And in case anyone is confused, Ashford=Zovio=UAGC, do not let all of the names fool you- they are all the same. Zovio, was FIRED from UAGC, and UAGC is about to lose its WASC accreditation. And yet the gaslighting continues?! It\u2019s not the enrollment advisors that are the problem; it\u2019s the ineffective upper management.\r\n\r\nMay UAGC be sued next and never recover. May a class action lawsuit materialize where all of the good people of UAGC and it\u2019s ineffective and shameful management, philosophy, and business practices wronged and stressed out be afforded a large settlement that helps them to attempt to forget the trauma UAGC caused them."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Chief Application Architect in Tucson, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The part of the U of A that I work at is great.
