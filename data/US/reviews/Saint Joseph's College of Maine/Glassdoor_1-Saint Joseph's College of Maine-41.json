Students are largely apathetic; there is very little activism, liberal or conservative, among students. What was once a college founded by the Sisters of Mercy, staffed by Sisters, it is now \"college first, Catholic second.\"  This is the official marketing/public relations position and downright offensive to the women who built Saint Joseph's College.
