Something to look up to for your resume. It's a very broad job, and it's certainly an insult for it to be considered clerical work when there's so much more than that.\r\n\r\nYou're on your feet a lot. It's hardly a sit-down job, or at least depending on what position you are in on a certain day. Therefore, you are very busy, time flies by, and you even manage weight by burning a lot of calories.\r\n\r\nTurnover is pretty high. While this may be considered a bad thing, I considered it great because I got to meet  lots of new people that I really liked a lot. I hardly had a problem with anyone.   \r\n\r\nIf you make a mistake, management is typically good with giving you breathing room on learning and being coached.", "cons": "Training is terrible \r\n\r\nManagement seems cool and laid back, but when it seems like you want to report something or give a concern, they don't really jump on top of it, or try to talk their way around it.\r\n\r\nYou are often blamed for a lot of mistakes that are not  yours to own, yet when nurses make mistakes, they call you to correct their errors. You are very watched by everybody around you, and people are quick to report you for any little thing. As a PA, you really do have a bad rep all around the hospital. Sometimes I'd walk by and get these weird stares from other departments. I kind of get the vibe we are not very liked.\r\n\r\nNurses/Doctors, and other employees outside of PA think you're stupid,  think you don't know how to do your job and you are often shoved to the side as if you have no real important role in what goes on behind the scenes. But, oh you do. Part of  your job is to assure the flow of money comes through the entity of UH. So, uh, yes, you're very important, but you are made to feel you're not and that you're invisible.\r\n\r\nYou are disrespected daily as well as a victim of verbal abuse. When you are mistreated, there is no type of support system. Management will tell you not to take it seriously and tell you to place yourself in the shoes of patients, yet no one is to be placed in our shoes.  You are likely to be reported if you expose any ounce of defending yourself to patients or visitors who have a huge entitlement problem. You MUST have thick skin to work here. The level of rudeness I've had to deal with was such a cultural shock to me that I could barely believe it.\r\n\r\nA second point to being disrespected = when you're doing your work,  which a majority of your responsibilities requires patient interviewing, you will often be interrupted by nurses and doctors coming into the patient's room and acting like you're not standing there. It has been one of the worst feelings in the world to have to excuse yourself out of the room and wait for them to get done.  One nurse that did this to me had caused a huge misunderstanding between me and the patient becuase I didn't get a chance to fully explain a certain situation before being interrupted. This is a HUGE problem with Patient Access becuase once again, you are seen as less important. Nurses/doctors rarely apologize and wait outside the door becuase PAs never go inside and interrupt patient care. So, why is it that it's okay for us to be insulted like this? And if nurses/doctors do come in and acknowledge you, they'll just stand there and wait, which puts more pressure on you to hasten up those questions and you're even more nervous. I DESPISE this part of PA the most.\r\n\r\nThere's barely any appreciation for what you do. While nurses get to have eat-outs on the job and are always highly given special treatment, there is nothing like that for Patient Access, unless you want to count Patient Access Week in April, where all you get to do is eat chilly dogs, and given a bag of boring food like popcorn and a can of soda.\r\n\r\nYou are exposed to patient conditions a lot. Therefore, you may experience increased illnesses. When you have to sign in or arrive those patients, you don't know what's wrong with them until the doctors figure out what they have.  You're right in the faces of those patients. Very close contact.\r\n\r\nYou are paid a crappy salary for not only all you have to go through, but all the responsibilities you have. For what I've gone through and have seen my fellow coworkers go through, this job SHOULD pay at least $17 to $20. Salary is between $11 and $13.  VERY ridiculous. There are hardly any raises, and had I known the job would cause me this much misery, I never would have arrived for an interview. I was barely happy coming to work.\r\n\r\nSometimes it's difficult to get a break, but when you clock out and it asks you if you had a break, and you choose no, you'll hear from the higher ups on why that didn't happen, and it's usually drama.\r\n\r\nUniforms are blue button-down shirts. I have often had some embarrassing malfunctions where my buttons were unbuttoned and I wasn't aware until I happen to see so or if somebody pointed it out.  It is a pain in the butt to wear those shirts. Speaking of uniforms, they make you spend nearly $30 for those shirts, and you have to go to Cintas to pick them up, which was really a hassle for me at the time.\r\n\r\nParking is a nightmare. You are forced to park about four blocks away where there is no reliable security guard to watch over your cars during the night. The hospital has experienced car vandalizing, and if your car is one of them, the financial responsibilities are on you. UH will turn their heads and not deal with it. I have not known any PA reps that got to park at a more convenient spot, unless if you work at the ACC building across the street."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Level 1 Trauma Center", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Oct 2017", "job_title": "ER Support Clerk in Shreveport, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the people were great, management was shifty.
