That said, it is important to point out that among (very selected) courses that I took, I found the professors pretty approachable and helpful.\r\n- Based on casual discussions with other graduate students, most of them seem pretty happy with their advisors (with issues like micro-managing, choice of problems, rapport, etc).\r\n- Funding situation is pretty good compared to other universities. Also, offices with 3 students per room are assigned to graduate students, which helps if you need peace and quiet while working ... some may like it, others may prefer a \"big\" lab-like environment.\r\n- There is lot of buzz going on in entrepreneurship at Rice for last few years. MBA-school is offering pretty good course on it, plus there are events like 3-day startup which are useful to both undergrads and grads. Rice OTT is also pretty helpful in this area.", "cons": "- There are fewer clubs and the current chair (along with few enthusiastic students) is trying to address that. So, as far as graduate students are concerned, there are relatively fewer opportunities to socialize ... though friday night gatherings at on-campus student-run pub Valhalla (which serves cheap beers) does help :)"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "PhD Student", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Feb 2021", "job_title": "PhD Student in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "We could still save some if we don't live lavishly", "cons": "Net is really small because the tax is high"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place for research", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Assistant in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really smart coworkers and the university really cares for its students and scholars", "cons": "None I can think of"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Not bad", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of chances and good environment", "cons": "Bad advisor would make you want to die."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good team, good hours, Flexible", "cons": "Low pay, minimal pay increases"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good program", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good professors and research areas.

It's nice to work in an environment with good people, working towards a goal that I strongly believe in and support. The campus is a peaceful oasis of forest and squirrels in the heart of the city. You can be as involved as you want in campus life. I choose to voluntarily spend extra time with students; it keeps me young and gives me hope for the future.\r\n\r\nThere's a student-run coffeehouse with excellent beverages, a grad-student bar with inexpensive drinks, and a vibrant selection of restaurants serving fresh sandwiches, multicultural tacos, freshly grilled foods, and pizza. Faculty and staff may purchase memberships in the on-campus, state of the art gym at a ridiculously low price, which gives us access to yoga, dance, and other classes. Employees may also take a class per semester for credit at no cost and Rice will reimburse us for a percentage of tuition fees. \r\n\r\nThe campus police are friendly and helpful, willing to shuttle you to your car if it's late at night. In fact, the ethos on campus from everyone is friendly -- quick with a smile and eager to help. Rice is generally noted for its friendliness to visitors and happy students. \r\n\r\nThe architecture is graceful and public art dots the campus. Open spaces are starting to fill in, sadly, but the recent-ish expansion in the undergraduate population demands more classes and professors to teach them. The grounds are well-kept and tended by an army of folks who constantly work to make Rice the astoundingly beautiful place that it is.", "cons": "Definitely negotiate your starting salary as high as you can because annual \"raises\" tend to be inflation-rate only. I get strong reviews and paltry \"raises,\" which will eventually lead me to look elsewhere no matter how much I love working here. \r\n\r\nCheck carefully into your department carefully before accepting an offer. Virtually all departments have wonderful people but a few do not. Find out how much turnover it has, why the position is open, and how many people are promoted over time. I've seen several departments in which there is high turnover or where everyone is working the same jobs for 7-10 years.\r\n\r\nParking is a thorn in my side. Eventually a new parking garage will be completed but in the meantime, my car is across campus, making it impossible for me to go out to lunch, run an errand over lunch, or pop home if I forgot to bring something. The hike to thee car or taking the bus adds significant time to my commute, assuring that I will always be in the thick of it. Once the garage is done, perhaps this will change but Rice charges its employees to park on campus and I shudder to think what the cost will be. \r\n\r\nRice self-insures, which probably saves it money, but the benefits atrophy a little each year while the costs rise. The premium raises haven't been insane but every year the co-pay increases, the deductible rises, and/or the coverage shrinks. The drug coverage is getting ridiculous, mandating that for some medications you cannot get them until first going through a whole series of other drugs first. Even if you've been through them before and what works for you wasn't any of those intermediary drugs. (I might be particularly bitter on that; that's a lot of migraines to suffer through until you can get something that dissolves under your tongue and won't be regurgitated almost as soon as it's swallowed.) I have seen lower paid staff struggle to come up with the mandated 3-months supply co-pays for children on \"maintenance\" drugs via the by-mail pharmacy. Again, that saves money but it transfers the hardship to those least able to afford it.\r\n\r\nThat's especially galling when this year's \"raise\" failed to cover the increase in the premiums and new deductible requirements.
