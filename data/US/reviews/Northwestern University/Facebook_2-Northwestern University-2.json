If your supervisor is reasonable, the job can be tolerable; if your supervisor is a micromanager, your job will be awful. Regardless of what your supervisor is like, certain faculty members are hellish to deal with and treat you like servants--I've never felt more disrespected in an office environment than I did in many interactions with faculty members here.

Very uneven organizational structure with little opportunity for advancement. No focus on hiring from within and developing internal talent.

Distant, unapproachable HR and recruiting team. Very little incentive to perform well aside from fear of poor performance evaluation ratings and reduction in annual pay-increase which is already laughably low.

Beautiful campus, talented and smart people, and what seemed to be above-average compensation. I worked with one of the best teams I've ever worked with, led by probably the best manager I've ever worked for, and it was a pleasure. \r\n\r\nBenefits are very good overall as well.

There is a lot of red tape (maybe more than most places) and micromanagement of finances, which unnecessarily complicates things. Some entities do not seem to offer anything to the organization but they consume financial resources, and I wonder why they still exist (e.g., TGS)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A",

A hierarchy is evident in most all corporate employment structures, though the separation between faculty and staff is more apparent than I ever experienced working in corporations.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate because a large portion university activities happen because of the work being done by those at the bottom of the hierarchy. \r\n\r\nBecause university staff positions do offer a number of great benefits, and this should not to be overlooked or minimized, even entry level positions have many applicants.  This allows the university to ignore what I believe is a pretty significant employee morale issue. A dysfunctional department will still be able to easily attract new staff, and many employees will remain in dysfunctional departments just to hold onto a great healthcare package."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Student Enrichment Services", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Evanston, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Mentoring for first generation students", "cons": "Large time commitment for full time student"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Ph.

The command and control leadership style has created a culture of fear and blame, resulting in poor communication within departments. Each department focuses on their own goals and interests. Department interdependencies remain completely overlooked in the evaluation process, each department works for itself, and fail to see how their practices works against the other or for the other.
