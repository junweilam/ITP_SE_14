I have gotten to know all of the staff members, and they\u2019re all fairly nice, with a few exceptions, but that\u2019s no different from any hospital I\u2019d assume.\nThis is a great place if your local to the area and don\u2019t want to commute or if you\u2019re trying to get your foot in the door in the medical field. Although, Memorial Medical Center is one city over, and far better from what I\u2019ve been told.\nGreat place to start off as a new RN and gain experience, seems like a lot of people from the Bay Area and Sacramento area do exactly that. They\u2019ll come and stay for 6 months to a year, and then move out to a bigger and better hospital.", "cons": "Management really does not care abt you, or your needs as an employee. No breaks, sometimes no lunches. Management genuinely will not do anything abt hiring more staff, or care abt increasing pay for there employees to help retain them. With inflation at roughly 9%, and a mediocre union bid to increase annual pay by 4% per year for 4 years is a slap to the face. Even as a CNA, there were newer CNA hires with no experience coming in that were getting paid a higher base salary than I was, when I had been there for several years. As an RN, staffing no ratios are horrible. Pre-pandemic we\u2019d be 4:1 if they\u2019re tele pts, and 5:1 otherwise. Now, we are 5:1 on a good day, and sometimes at 6:1 and even 7:1 depending on how short we are for the day. To combat this they offer Triple Agency pay and Bonuses, but even then it\u2019s seldom, and still not enough of a boost to make it worthwhile. Any time you pick up past the 40 hours, taxes on your income are increased, so yes they\u2019re offering more money but it ends up getting taken out by taxes. A solution: just offer your employees a higher base pay, rather than hiring more travel nurses. Fix the long term issue, not by hiring more travel RNs, but by increasing base pay. This\u2019ll retain more employees, and then hire more nurses. Hope this helped."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "RN", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Nursing in Turlock, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "community based nursing with hard working people.", "cons": "it was purchased by large corporation"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Cerified Phlebotomist in Turlock, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible hours, great management, good benefits", "cons": "Payroll is a third party so hard to get the information needed. low pay rate"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great experience just not enough staff", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Turlock, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place for learning if your a new nurse", "cons": "Never have enough staff everday there is a staffing shortage but yet make new policies on top of a \"staffing shortage\"."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Tenet owned, for profit healthcare", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Turlock, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- great STEMI care, - Commitees that are RN driven to speak their voice and review change (not that it is always listened to)", "cons": "- poor care from incompetent nurses, - RN training facility because or low pay - worry more about making money than exceptional care, - all about proper paperwork to CYA, - expensive poor quality medical insurance for employees, - poor electronic charting setup, mostly alpaperwork with double charting electronically"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Still being here after several years speaks volumes.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "29 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Sonographer in Turlock, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people and community have kept me here .
