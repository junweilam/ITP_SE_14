I don't feel out of the loop about important decisions and changes (from my unit to university-wide). I work with a lot of smart people, and we have a freedom to try out new ideas. I have felt very supported in terms of professional growth: good training when I started, money for conferences and continuing education, and opportunities to take just about any class here that I want to through the Regents' scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are good although long-time Minnesotans might disagree; apparently they are not as good as they used to be, but they are far better than at universities where I worked previously. My teeth are happy that dental insurance costs are pretty low and affordable; that may be a function of the scale of this place. I like the programs the University has instituted in an effort to improve employee wellness (e.g., 100% health insurance coverage for preventative care like gyn exams, opportunities to take fitness classes, a farmer's market in the summer, coaching on changing health-related behaviors). They offer same-sex domestic partner benefits and are good at being inclusive throughout forms and other places where that information is relevant. I do feel that the administration is genuinely concerned with keeping employees happy and healthy even if I don't like every decision they make. \r\n\r\nThe sheer size of the university means that it is something of a small city and has some really great resources; I can go to the dentist, doctor, pharmacy, post office, gym, a dance performance, register my car and get IT assistance on my personal laptop all without leaving campus. There are a lot of innovative projects going on technology-wise in many parts of the university as well as really interesting research in the academic departments.

I know others who have had a less positive experience related to who their immediate co-workers are. Not everyone has a boss as communicative, respectful, and people-savvy as mine. I don't feel like I have many opportunities for advancement with the way my department/unit is structured which also means fewer opportunities for salary increases (not likely with current economic situation in Minnesota anyway). This isn't huge, but I don't like some of the tensions over/between the 4 different classifications of employees (faculty, professional & academic (P&A), civil service, and bargaining unit (represented by unions)); there is a little animosity (probably too strong a word but can't think of another) towards the faculty and, to a lesser degree, P&A staff at times from the other classes of employees. Winter in Minnesota is not great, but it's bearable.\r\n\r\nThe other negatives are more about academia in general. The University tends to operate as lots of little fiefdoms (departments, units, etc) where each unit or department or division does things their own way even if it duplicates something others on campus do. There may be some changes coming related to that, but that remains to be seen. As is probably not uncommon in large universities, there are many levels of bureaucracy which can slow down decisions and changes (e.g., hiring a new person for a faculty or professional position can take close to a year from posting the position to starting the job)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The good, the bad, and the ugly", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Account Specialist in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free or reduced tuition, interesting learning experiences, opportunities to develop great friendships and build connections for later in your career.", "cons": "Awful pay unless you are management.... which it isn't hard to be management, as the U of M is notoriously top heavy.
