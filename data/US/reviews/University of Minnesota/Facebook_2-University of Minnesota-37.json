Starting salaries (and subsequent ones) are higher at UIUC, Ohio State, UW Madison, and obviously the private schools like Northwestern and U Chicago. \nPromotion and pretenure job retention are still heavily dependent on raising external and federal research dollars. These expectation were clear and up front, and certainly they are not responsible for decades of reduced funding at federal agencies, but it made achieving success precarious and undermined some of the collegial atmosphere. Standard for the field, but a downside nonetheless. Finally, UMN suffers from national and international cultural stigma against flyover country, particularly the upper Midwest. It's just not seen as vibrant or exciting as Silicon Valley, New York, Boston, the Rockies or the Pacific Northwest, which adds a roadblock to attracting a subset of the most innovative grad students who can pick where they go.\nAlso, the University is public and a huge employer in the biggest city in the region.

One thing they all have in common has been a good perspective on work/life balance. Hours are typically standard business 8-5, with a range of flexibility therein depending on your leadership. This includes remote options, especially since COVID, flexible lunch, and depending on classification adjusting work hours to suit family or personal needs.\r\n\r\nBenefits are also very good. Our family opts for U of M benefits, which comes with staff perks ... such as reduced rate at the Rec Center, reduced rate for bike commuting, and other incentives to stay active while working--again, a very good sense of work/life balance. There is no expectation to be \"chained to the desk.\"\r\n\r\nThe other thing is it's just great working on a university campus as large and diverse as the University of Minnesota. It's like living/working within a small town in a lot of ways and all your townsfolk are the students, staff, and faculty who make the place run.", "cons": "After over a decade in higher education, it is a place that one could go and find a fulfilling career. However, there are a few drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThe first is the pay. It's generally lower than equivalent positions in industry. However, higher education (and education across the board) is largely under-funded, so if competitive salary is your goal, higher ed may not be where you want to land.\r\n\r\nRelated, opportunities for advancement are few and far between. I've only seen promotions twice in my career. One of my colleagues essentially created their own management role out of necessity and successfully made a case to the department, college, and various levels of bureaucracy to get a pay/title bump. The other promotion was standard fill/replace a manager from qualified internal candidates. There really aren't promotions or pay increases based on merit. You can expect a 1-2% raise annually which doesn't keep up with inflation rates, but the tradeoff is a sustainable, relatively low pressure working environment (though it can be stressful in ways you wouldn't expect---stakes can be very high, for very low stakes activities/goals, and progress can be slow, cumbersome, and confusing)\r\n\r\nLastly, leadership is a mixed bag. I've had great managers and very bad managers at all levels. This may be similar to any other industry, but, still, regardless, a con across the board. A bad manager can make a good job terrible. A good manager can make a bad job great.

The CIO doesn't have control over IT teams outside of his own department. The senior directors in my structure rarely cared to provide all staff meeting updates (town halls). At non-management team levels, there is no talk about how well the broader institution is doing or how we are impacting the broader good. And if you are not in a job level equivalent to management level you are likely to not even hear about departmental and people changes unless it directly impacts you - and not rarely from the hallway. Project Management as a full rigor discipline is highly avoided, and often impossible as rarely individuals are dedicated to any one project. PMO was extinguished several years ago, and operations support personnel (including management) is unable to define the boundaries of operations vs projects. No meaningful metrics, lengthy documentation requests for approval, historical knowledge and little to no feedback or leveraging of them at all. By the way, procurement process (including RFP) is not considered part of the largest \"projects\". Management pretend to be open and supportive to ideas, but do not recognize their own mistakes and find ways to leave aside those who provide candid and constructive feedback against the status quo. Action plans for opportunity areas identified in engagement surveys are rarely put together, and I haven't heard or seen any testimony of any example of one carried out to the end."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Senior Events Management and Communications Specialist in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, room to grow across the University into new roles", "cons": "Decision making processes can be slow"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "More than a receptionist", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Executive Office Assistant in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Union organized clerical unit\r\nExcellent benefits", "cons": "Not inclusive\r\nManagement is controlling \r\nManagement does not allow for you to attend classes on campus"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Research Associate in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The insurance is awesome.
