You can't get any help from anyone because everyone is busy. Some won't help you because they are spiteful, others just can't because they don't have the time. Some nursing assistants are good, others are not. The floor is always understaffed, and if it is staffed properly, someone is getting floated to another floor. In some cases nursing assistants prefer to chat with each other rather than do their work. Bilingual should be a mandatory requirement. The goal of every nurse I have met has been to get out as soon as something better comes along. The pay is not even good. All the staff I have personally come across have stated they are unhappy. The hospital stands for quality patient care, however how could anyone provide good quality patient care when the floors are understaffed and the staff is overworked. Nurse/patient ratio is too high.
