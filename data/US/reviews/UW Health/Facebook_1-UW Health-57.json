There is combativeness between departments that led to an awful work experience when you need to work with other groups. I dreaded having to work with other departments at times because of how unwilling to help, and how unfriendly some of the staff were. Being on-call was one of the worst parts about the job, even if it was a handful of times per year. Getting paged for the most benign things and getting woken up multiple times per night for alerts that would clear themselves was frustrating. You also get paged by other departments frequently who decide to skirt around change control requirements and do upgrades that break things in the middle of the night. There was no work/life balance due to the amount of production-affecting issues that happened constantly.

We have helped countless people in spite of other issues.", "cons": "The positivity is only for the sake of patients. Employees as a whole are miserable.\r\nHigh performance is discouraged. The former \"performance management\"\r\nsystem was done away with after too many people complained that every employee regardless of merit was given the same performance score as a way to save money. Ergo, high performance is actively discouraged. \r\n\r\nThe plethora of horrible managers can basically do what they will based on their personal feelings to their reports with no way for reports to defend themselves from the many slimy, often incompetent managers. \r\nI've seen many very experienced people be hired and then treated as a threat or ignored until they either quit or get fired for simply performing at their level of competence and experience. The turnover in some non clinical departments is mind boggling. Many managers have been hired not for their leadership aptitudes like sound judgement or lack of insecurity, \r\nor technical competence but for their ability to blow smoke. There have been a couple notable exceptions who almost immediately became jaded and looked for a way to escape their own direct manager. \r\nI've never seen so many senior employees step down from their roles in frustration. It truly is a sight to behold. \r\n\r\nEmployees are clearly treated as dollars only. There is no concern in some non clinical departments for employee retention, not through recognition, employee development like mentoring or training, no concern at all if someone leaves other than the obligatory lip service (after notice of resignation not before) to keep up appearances. No action taken to retain any employee unless there is a specific dollar amount for training attached to that employee and then it's only as a knee-jerk reaction. \r\nThere is no attempt at employee development in many departments.\r\n\r\nIn departments where it's critical to retain experienced employees for the safety of the organization, the pattern has been to hire people who have literally had no other job before one where experience should be the baseline. \r\nEvery other experienced person leaves as soon as they can, creating and endless cycle that managers, lacking in any proactivity and a great many necessary aptitudes cannot address. \r\nIt takes a departmental staffing crisis to create enough signal to affect basic changes in management operations and employee treatment and that signal has to get to upper levels in the org for the requirement to improve even a little gets back to the department. \r\n\r\nBeing attached to a government institution and with part of the org being a 'state' entity, there is always a toxic stew of progressive box-checking politics which makes an already difficult environment much worse. Every one is supposed to be respected as an individual, unless you can check one of those boxes, then you quickly realize that not all are respected the same from the view of the org regardless of how great interactions between co-workers may be and that reflects in management decision making."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "UW Health Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) in Madison, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I feel recognized by my immediate manager and coworkers.
