The Clinical Director, the Direct-Care Supervisor, and the Program Director are amazing - you are lucky to have them. (This is not to be confused with Lahey Health Behavioral Services management in Danvers...they couldn't care less about clients or staff. It's all about the profit for them).\r\n\r\nSome of the staff are so so nice and fun to work with. There are some people who are real team players and I enjoyed spending time with them. \r\n\r\nThe health benefits are great - with low premiums for those who work at least 30 hours. They also offer benefits to part-time staff which is great. They will attempt to hire you as Per Diem (yet give you 40 hours) so they don't have to give you benefits though. \r\n\r\nGreat PTO benefits.", "cons": "Boston Treatment Center, a detox run by Lahey Health Behavioral Services, is a necessity for the community it serves, but it needs a lot of improvement.\r\n\r\nFirstly, so many staff members are under-educated, unqualified, and uncaring - the nursing staff in particular. Clients are treated very poorly by nursing (not all nurses - there are 3 or 4 I can think of who are amazing). When clients are asking for help or are trying to speak to a nurse they are often completely ignored. The nurses will just be on their phone - they can clearly hear the client - and they just pretend they are not there. It can be like walking on eggshells for a client to try to talk to the nurses or ask them for something. Sometimes nurses will refuse to admit someone for no good reason too.\r\n\r\n******** Again, as mentioned in the \"Pros\" section, THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE the Clinical Director, the Direct-Care Supervisor, and the Program Director - they are amazing. ********\r\n\r\nI understand that Boston Treatment Center treats a difficult population, but you knew that when you started working there. If you can't handle SICK withdrawing clients being a bit irritated and rude, work somewhere else. Have some compassion for these people and don't stoop to their level. You are a clinician, they are a patient. You are not on the streets.\r\n\r\nThere are some staff members who would be much better suited as Correctional Officers at South Bay. YOU CANNOT SCREAM AT CLIENTS. I don't understand why some people have been allowed to work there for so long with the way they treat clients.\r\n\r\nThe pay is horrible. What kind of hospital organization pays its full-time staff so so low that they qualify for SNAP and WIC? It's terrible. For the amount of work that case managers have to do, the paychecks are insulting.\r\n\r\nAlso, the area is extremely dangerous and there is no security. Allegedly we have access to BPHC's security because they own the building, but I have never seen their presence in the building. Tewksbury detox has a security guard in the building and they are basically located in the woods, we should have one too. Staff members have asked Danvers multiple times for a security presence in the building. Clients can be unpredictable.\r\n\r\nThere is also little to no accountability when it comes to incompetent staff. Staff members are defended to a fault - when they should be fired for misconduct and subordination. So many staff also steal from each other. No respect. I think some staff also steal clients' cigarettes.\r\n\r\nDon't even get me started on COVID protocols and responses. The email from the CEO talking about his cut in pay as a sacrifice for the company was pretty laughable. I can't even believe you sent that email to us. We're out here with no hazard pay making 30k a year and sitting across the desk (with no protective divider) from people who are at a high risk of having Covid-19. Your temporary pay cut doesn't impress us! Grocery stores are providing more protection to their employees than you (a medical facility) are."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Run on a medical model", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Outpatient Clinician in Lawrence, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most employees are great, supportive, professional co-workers", "cons": "pay, productivity demands, micromanaging, treating mental health therapy like someone is being seen for a medical problem"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Outpatient at Lahey could not have been worse", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Mental Health Clinician in Gloucester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loved my co workers and my patients", "cons": "The worst management you can imagine."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Started out great, and turned into an abusive environment.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Intake Coordinator in Gloucester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Full time work, great benefits, although very expensive, great co-workers.", "cons": "Management was demeaning, did not provide any positive reinforcement."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Overall good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Family Partner in Beverly, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Incredible coworkers and management within CSA.
