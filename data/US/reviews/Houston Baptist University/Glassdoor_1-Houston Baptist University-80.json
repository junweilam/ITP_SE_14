This is especially devastating when you consider that most entry-level positions pay you less here than at other Universities.

Use this job as a stepping stone to get into better positions at Universities that are growing. I've experienced and witnessed the way HBU prioritizes numbers and dollar signs over people and I can tell you that the culture they \"promote\" is not the same as the one that exists. Since there are so many staff members who leave, and since HBU doesn't have the funds to hire more people, many lower-level staff members are overworked and it shows.
