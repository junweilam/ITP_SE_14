I have never worked in a company where the president took that much time to show his/her personal appreciation for the newly hired staff.

Opportunity for improvement and to use many skills if you can breach the cultural climate.", "cons": "Management can be patronizing, racist, classist, conservative Republican and intolerant, many co-workers are toxic, hostile, and passive aggressive.  Benefits are the industry standard and not as exceptional as told to candidates excluding the401K plan as any other company.  No training provided, unclear expectations, high turnover rate ( my position was previously filled by four other employees whom mysteriously left and or was fired. While working there two other people vanished for reasons unknown). If you don't pretend to be Republican, wealthy ( from the right family) and a football enthusiast you are shunned and setup to fail. Management will welcome you with open arms then listen to other employees who are in self-protection mode because of the cutthroat climate and will throw you under the bus. Communication, project planning, and task assignment was the most unorganized confusing place I have ever worked. I am completing my third degree, and I have successfully met all of these challenges despite many issues yet this organization was insurmountable with hostility and toxicity making even the most competent candidate feel ostracized.\r\nAs a new employee patronizing was the norm for standard and general inquiry a new employee makes when transitioning. Expectations were set for a task that had not been performed before or had significant changes in procedure that management remain unaware of and indifferent to how this impacted performance.  There was no set performance evaluation ( ever disclosed to me), and all things were decided based on subjective gossip.You believe the management is fair and balanced yet as soon as reasonable problems occur for a new employee their loyalty is intense for tenured employees (some are very committed and concerned for healthy outcomes . While others are over aggressive bullies) to the point of blindness to unhealthy dynamics. \r\n\r\nWorking for this company was the worst decision I have ever made.  If you have no self-respect, value one-side relationships, classism, and far right wing conservative views this company is for you if not look elsewhere.  After a few weeks you have no idea who to trust, the honeymoon phase ends, two-faced reports begin to take place and subtle yet undeniable hostility starts to show from management."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Place To Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "27 Apr 2015", "job_title": "RNC in Mansfield, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great upper management and communication.
