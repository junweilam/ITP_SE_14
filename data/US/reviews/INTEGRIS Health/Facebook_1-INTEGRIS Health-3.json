Some of them are still there. \r\n\r\n- Compensation actually improved (for me personally anyway) after the Intermountainers came along. Before that, the salary was stagnating and disappointingly low for a lot of people (including me). Now it seems to be on par (even higher) than similar jobs in other markets.\r\n\r\n- The focus on metrics and such, while occasionally eye-roll inducing, does seem to encourage a level of transparency that wasn't there before.\r\n\r\n- The \"Idea Board\" and \"Huddles\" encourage innovation and caregivers to be more involved.\r\n\r\n- The new leadership brought with it a greater sense of professionalism, and less of that \"Okie-Doke\" vibe. Which is potentially a con for some. I kinda liked it though.\r\n\r\n- It is still a leading employer in the city/state. So as far as being a resume builder, there are only a handful of companies like this that look pretty fantastic (depending on the role) on your LinkedIn.", "cons": "- Little room/hope for professional growth or upward mobility, unless you're an administrative intern/fellow (which are largely out of your reach unless you went to the right school, or you know the right people) Mostly, you have to know a former Intermountainer if you hope to grow in your career at INTEGRIS Health. And there's even less chance for professional growth if you're an ethnic minority. It's laughably the opposite of diverse. Although they're quick to point at a couple of specific women in leadership as if that makes up for the lack everywhere else. \r\n\r\n- A lot of very capable people with significant potential are reduced to being mere mouse monkeys because of the super siloed, hierarchical approach to work/leader engagement. Which means that often, some of the best work that some of the best employees do isn't even recognized by many people in the organization. Not sure if this is true on the clinical side, but it was most definitely true in the departments that I worked in. \r\n\r\n- For a supposed \"tech company\", the benefits are anemic at best. Insurance is average. The PTO/PPL is disappointing (no national holidays included, and the accrual rate is abysmal for new people). And I tried to take advantage of the employee discount on healthcare services one year, and the discount only applied to a specific part of my bill and saved me a grand total of $100... on something that I had to pay $4,000 for out of pocket (by the end). The food discount is practically nonexistent at the facilities, and the corporate folks don't even get a discount anymore for their vendor food. So even as an employee, you're not going to get much of an advantage. Also, things like the \"Walking Taco\" is a sham of an employee meal and is a constant reminder of how far the food quality has fallen over the last decade or so (especially at Baptist Medical Center). The turkey is nice I guess... I'd prefer a better retirement contribution but whatever floats y'alls boats. \r\n\r\n- A lot of brain drain over the last few years has made for chaos and confusion. Even after I left, I sometimes would get phone calls asking to fill in the gaps on specific things about my old job, because I was literally the only one in the entire organization who used to do it. \r\n\r\n- Over the last few years, leadership has definitely gotten rid of the \"we're a family\" vibe. There's no family left at INTEGRIS, and there is no doubt that you'll be kicked to the curb if you don't toe the party line. The C-suite leaders are far removed now too from the plebs, err I mean frontline staff; definitely an ivory tower feel with the new folks. So now there are some real incompetent leaders that have gotten pretty far in their careers bc their \"Yes-Man\" skills are amazing. The Associate CIO for example. \r\n\r\n- The \"Idea Board\" and \"Huddles\" also produce some real low effort nonsense, for the sake of creating the appearance of participation, and ends up creating a lot of unnecessary busy work."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Not worth it", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I had some great coworkers and made lifelong friends", "cons": "The management was awful and needed more experience leading people"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Hospital Housekeeping", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Oct 2022", "job_title": "EVS Lead in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you come in on your day off.

These are more than likely made by HR employees to help the overall rating to go up.\n\nWhere do I begin? I joined Integris thinking it would be a great opportunity but as a month or so went by I was dead wrong. The finance department that I was in expected me to work like a slave even WHILE PREGNANT! I kid you not my manager made me stay up til 9-10pm working on useless reports some nights. She thought that working from home at night, after hours made it \u201cbetter/more comfortable\u201d for me at 8 months pregnant. There is absolutely no work-life balance here which is the #1 reason why I left. My horrible manager also texted me during maternity leave (that was NOT paid I had to sign up for short term disability) to complete an HR survey! She did not understand boundaries. She was the absolute worst! So was the director! I had COVID back in January and I sent in my positive test in and everything but I still got in trouble for not giving my work 100% and my manager actually told me \u201cyou\u2019re lucky your team stepped up for you because I could\u2019ve made you get out of bed and work\u201d\u2026 I absolutely lost it on her and got written up for it but it was worth it. Who says that to employees/ people who are legitimately sick in general? I even went to her boss and told her that her manager expected me to work while sick and she sided with my manager on that! She said \u201cif we need you to come in then we need you to come in even if you\u2019re sick.\" WE WORK AT A HOSPITAL!!!! A hospital that had people dying of COVID! You would think health for everyone would be priority! I guess they wouldn\u2019t have cared if I came in and spread COVID to more people?? For real working here will make you feel like you\u2019re just absolutely losing your mind.This is just some of what I experienced here. Integris is an extremely toxic environment and comes from the top so I 100% do NOT approve of the CEO. There was a shooting in our parking garage back in March where one of our employees was stabbed and shot and absolutely nothing has been done to improve safety for employees. The CEO did put on a \u201csafety awareness week\u201d though that included emails on success stories on how safety was prioritized by some employees. What a joke!\nYou would also think that the benefits and perks would be good at Integris with them being the largest hospital in the state, but they aren\u2019t. You can only go to Integris facilities including urgent cares. You still pay for health insurance; it is not free to employees. You also have to accrue paid time off every month, you are not given any time at all to begin with, so it takes forever to build. You also must use anything that you accrue for holidays and closings or you don\u2019t get paid. So even on snow days I had to use my paid time off (that takes forever to accrue) even though I was fully capable of working from home. Just ridiculous. There is also no bonus, but I did get a whole 1.5% raise at year end after all of my hard work. The pay isn\u2019t great and I was definitely underpaid being a salaried employee who worked a ridiculous amount of hours. \nI worked in finance/admin and it was just terrible so I couldn\u2019t imagine how it is for nurses and other medical staff. No wonder why there is a labor shortage and Integris just keeps losing employees by the day.

She began to change my shifts and write me up for untruthful allegations. The other nurse continued to harass and spread rumors about 'us' in the workplace and I tried going to HR who began an investigation. Unfortunately my manager and the HR rep were known to be good friends and instead of the investigation relieving me of pressure from my manager and allowing me to transfer to another floor to escape the creeper (he looked up my address on a county assessor website and showed up at my house!), HR began to make allegations that I had been lying to them about this imaginary relationship and, based on the word of my manager, that this other nurse and I were a known item on the floor. I was fired for impeding an investigation despite having alibis and proof to the contrary.\r\n\r\nMorals of the story: 1) if your manager is crazy, record any private conversations. One audio recording of how my manager was beyond ridiculous (yelling, name calling, screaming) during a sitdown would have changed a lot. 2) If you are sexually harassed at Integris, don't expect people to take it seriously. You will need to produce some sort of evidence/reason and have a restraining order placed on the person by law enforcement. 3) Don't always expect a company's HR to be in your corner. Like any other positions, the person who you are sitting with and expect to help you in the workplace may in fact be influenced by other relationships and bias.
