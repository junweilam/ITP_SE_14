Most companies like this offer rotating weekends, but a lot of the full time RCs are working weekend shifts every week since they need full time hours (due to being underpaid)\n-Upper management is basically absent and PDs make crap up as they go along and have no one to answer to 98% of the time\n-Most RCs have a set schedule, but when training classes come up, they HAVE to go to them even if they have plans or it conflicts with their schedule.
