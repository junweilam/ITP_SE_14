Advising used to be its own department and had a different structure where students were served by one or two advisors. It later became a call center where policy and procedural changes occur each week, and numbers are the ONLY thing that matters. In order to support Pat Robertson's delusional vision of competing with Liberty and having 100,000+ students, Regent changed advising to a one-stop-shop call center to answer all student's questions and concerns. Supposedly advisors were \"specialized\" into undergrad online, undergrad on-campus, and three grad teams (splitting up the grad schools). However, the advisors had to take calls from any student, even ones when they aren't familiar with their program, and do their best to help before making a task for their advising team to call back. Many times some teams had 150+ call-back tasks which would take weeks to clear. \r\n\r\nAdvisors are expected to know pretty much about every single undergrad, grad, and doctoral program, even if it's not their \"assigned\" population. Additionally, Enrollment Management wanted to save money so instead of hiring more financial aid specialists they made Financial Aid a behind-the-scenes department and made advisors the front line for financial aid as well. Having to learn all academic programs, most grad, and undergrad financial aid policies, and keep up with weekly changes is demoralizing and virtually impossible. It was also a horrible experience for students who were not guided on how to access the website during their admissions period and frequently called advising for every single need. This resulted in some days with over 2k inbound advising and financial aid calls with only 35 advisors available to answer the phones.

I started as an admissions counselor, moved to a supervisor role, then a data analyst. \r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nBuilding professionals:\r\nThe entire human resources strategy is designed (at least it seems that way) to take young, willing, Christians and build them as professionals. By the time those individuals get some experience, they move onto the next career. If you are invested in learning, are humble, adjust behaviors to constructive criticism well then you will excel.

I struggled as a supervisor at first but grew over time. That can be challenging for members who are working the front lines. The leadership at the top of Enrollment Management are great leaders and people. The middle leadership to front line supervisors can have a heavy mix of challenging leadership styles.\r\n\r\nPay:\r\nBecause Enrollment Management is focused on developing young leaders, the pay is lower than desirable. As your skills increase, this becomes more noticeable. It is somewhat part of the culture that people will leave for other opportunities, which is okay and accepted.\r\n\r\nSchedule:\r\nAs a front-line worker, it's rough. One of the benefits of growing into other roles is finally having a normal 8am to 5pm schedule during the weekdays. Before that, most team members will work one evening shift a week and one weekend shift a month. Breaks and lunches can be strongly enforced. It's not as bad as other call centers, but it is a call center.

I have fallen in love with the leadership because they do speak very nicely and always have something nice to say to you. Still, how can all these unethical practices come from such loving people?  \r\n- When I first started here it was a beautiful environment where we had time to call our prospects and did not need to worry about getting so many applications. I think the university got very excited that we reached our students goals 2 years in a row and so they continued to make bigger and bigger goals. They hired a lot more people, combined the application and registration teams, and created smaller teams for more training opportunities. We were looking up! Unfortunately, it did not work like we would have hoped. We bought more leads and were required to get more applications. This means that we were over saturated with applications without the time to call all of them back for conversations and registration. My team changed so much that I had 5 new coaches in the span of 12 months. This I was very, very hard especially with the constant programs details naturally changing. Every coach had different expectations and things they did not care about. When we got used to doing our job one way to make that coach satisfied, we had to change it again. The next coach, every time, acted like the coach before did not have a clue what they were talking about. I found this very strange. \r\n- There is no written standard for program information or QA. While there is written standards for the calls scripts, this changes so often it is very hard to keep up with. \r\n- There is a lot of talk about \"practicing multitasking\". What they mean is you literally need to be able to do emails, outbound calls, inbound calls, dialer, additional tasks, certain training videos, etc at the same time. According to the research in education, which I had done significant research in, our brains cannot sufficiently focus on more than one thing at a time. It is better to prioritize a few areas to do them well and them move onto a few more areas. I have explained this to my leadershio adn they agreed with me, yet when I get in trouble for not answering their email because I am busy trying to meet the overall goal of registrations by calling my applicants, I am reprimanded. When everything is priority, nothing is a priority and goals WILL SUFFER. \r\n- Most if not all of the employees feel helpless because of the two-faced attitudes of the leadership. I do not think that they are conscious of this because like I said, I could totally be friends with these people . But when you say \"You can come to me with anything especially if you are scared or hurt\" , and then when you come to them because you are scared or hurt they say, \"I always pictured you as a positive and strong pillar on our team, but this attitude is not becoming of an AC, especially not one considering leadership\". Hold on. So, unless I sit on the issues and smile and wave, I have an attitude problem? I am very hurt at the way I have been \"put in my place\" time and time again. I have been a top performer for over 12 months (since I started), especially since I have been doing this same job for over 6 years. Now that numbers are declining, I am once again being \"coached\" on how to do the job that I have already been very successful at doing. Nothing has changed. I am still the same person. I refuse to harass my students and I refuse to app unqualified candidates  just to be rejected. I care about people too much to drag them along.

Since the resignation of the university\u2019s president about 6 years ago, and the previous Executive Vice President\u2019s job being split about 3 years ago between three EVP positions (which seems to have been recombined again into one), the university appears to be drifting and sinking. This seems largely due to executive leaders pushing through all kinds of plans and programs (they often seem whimsical or vague or a combination), or trying to fix problems (real and perceived) without any meaningful input from beyond the executive leaders and those close to them. A biblical metaphor might be that of pharaoh forcing the Israelites to gather their own straw while increasing their quota of bricks, even while Egypt is being devastated by plagues. It feels oppressive at Regent to say the least, and creative and independent types may find it very difficult to work in an environment where their combined creativity and independence may be distrusted by the executive leadership.\r\n\r\nThe university seems to have lost its way, although some might say it has rarely had a clear direction other than whatever in-the-moment always-changing notion the Chancellor offers. (Who knows where the board stands?) Unfortunately, like most workplaces, there are those who remain loyal to the leadership, in spite of being mistreated by them, and who will sing the university\u2019s praises even while it sinks (see some of the positive reviews here that do not seem aware of the negative aspects of the university). Others keep their heads down to survive and do what they can to help each other and minister to the students that come here.\r\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s true that the university\u2019s enrollment has grown, the endowment, amazingly, seems to have shrunk. In fact, the faculty and staff were told that achieving certain enrollment goals would help keep the university from having to draw heavily from the endowment. This does not seem to have been the case, and no one\u2014myself included (keeping myself as safe as possible)\u2014will bring this up. Memories are short around here, and any reminder would likely be seen as disloyalty and perhaps reason for being \u201clet go.\u201d The executive leadership\u2019s inability to accomplish what, it says, will help the university, strongly suggests not only fiscal irresponsibility on its part but inability to think critically about its role as protectors of the institution for the sake of the institution\u2019s stakeholders. Unfortunately, most if not all disagreement is seen by the executive leadership as disloyalty, so people keep their mouths shut about the executive leadership\u2019s seemingly endless \u201cinitiatives\u201d and plans\u2014often implemented and then forgotten about.
