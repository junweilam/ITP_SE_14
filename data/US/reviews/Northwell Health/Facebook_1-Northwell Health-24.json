This is 100% my least favorite part of the job, and I believe Corporate should be cleaned up of inefficient and incompetent employees and it needs to be restructured to better support the sites and employees it's meant to actually support. \nPay - very low salary bands for most positions.

Now, while the organization overall is great, then you have specific hospitals and then you have all the departments you can work for. I loved NSUH, but working in the dietary/nutrition department was a terrible experience. I actually want to know what the qualifications are for running this department because the way they behave, I feel like a group of monkeys can come together and do a better job. Managers plays favorites with employees and it\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen in all my years. They will clock in/out friends/employees without them being there. They will pay certain friends/employees when they\u2019re on vacation PTO when they\u2019re not in a qualified position for PTO. They will even step in to do their friends/employees job when that employee has disapprove the locker room or even worse, left the hospital altogether to go outside to drink, or smoke, go to the store, whatever they feel like doing. You even have certain \u201cleaders\u201d in the kitchen who were selling drugs at nighttime. Nighttime is the worst shift by far to work here you can ask anyone. No serious supervision or management at night (it\u2019s normally during the day) so taking advantage, the supposed supervisors they have to manage are letting their friends do whatever they want. Drink, smoke, eat. It\u2019s terrible at night nobody wants to work this shift because if you\u2019re not friends with the supervisors, you\u2019re left to do everything their friends don\u2019t want to do while they hang out downstairs. If you\u2019re a guy and you don\u2019t want to sleep or flirt with the night leads, you will be left to do everything. If you\u2019re a fellow WOMAN, it\u2019s even worse because you\u2019re a threat so you don\u2019t stand a chance. Overall, the favoritism is out of hand. Management is never coordinated and on one team. Treat you like robots and you end up miserable. Work anywhere but in dietary it will be a sad mistake. I have to write this here because actually talking to upper-management or HR doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re wasting your time. They just go back to their supervisors and tell them what you said and will even coach them on how to retaliate you without you knowing. Yeah they play both sides all the time, extremely fake and two-faced, so honestly don\u2019t trust yourself talking to any of them. Just prepare yourself to leave altogether. I have to write and expose this here hoping maybe it reaches the right people to investigate and make improvements.
