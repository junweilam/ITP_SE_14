North Shore LIJ is unfortunately extremely demanding in their work load, never a moment to breath and have to scarf lunch down in 10 minutes (if at all), even going to the bathroom is difficult because of lost time due to the extremely unreasonable work load.  Management is horrible, bullying and abusive.  Every day someone is singled out by management for torture, abuse, yelling, threats - management takes their \"discipline\" beyond  anything acceptable, HR is aware but can't do anything about it (numerous complaints), and the higher-ups don't care so long as work is done on the ridiculous budget that makes management look good.  The yelling, screaming, threats, constant abuse and disrespect by management is beyond anything I experienced anywhere else in over 15 years, the turn over in this department is 40 - 50%, but nothing ever changes.  No one is happy and everyone is unduly stressed and even scared and intimidated by the horrible management that makes the stressful workload even more unbearable."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Don\u2019t recommend", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Occupational Therapist in Staten Island, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some clinical positions are unionized", "cons": "Laid off hospital staff post pandemic"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Nursing", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Manager in New Hyde Park, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High salaries, plentiful workers for jobs", "cons": "not inclusive in decision making plans"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Northwell HS", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Supervisor in Staten Island, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The offer a decent benefit package", "cons": "Upper leadership is unengaged and dismissive."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Giant PR machine that does not walk the talk", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Senior Director in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Large organization with many locations and departments.

If you're looking to get into the Health system, Northwell is where you want to look since they now own most of the major hospitals in Nassau & Queens.  Lots of growth opportunities and the potential to move into other departments (usually for non-medical roles).  \r\n\r\nHere's some of the major perks to being a Talent Acquisition Specialist:\r\n\r\n* Lots of flexibility - you are given a laptop and a phone and can work remote, either from home or on-site at one of your \"client\" locations somewhat often\r\n\r\n* Strong team mentality - there's rarely any competition other than standard friendly rivalries. \r\n\r\n* Northwell pays relatively well for internal corporate recruiting but could be better \r\n\r\n* Organized teams with dedicated individuals servicing specific roles within client locations means you don't get the \"mayonnaise\" effect of feeling spread too thin managing too many portfolios (though that doesn't mean you won't be insanely busy)\r\n\r\n* Lots of training opportunities and the occasional team-building outing encourages friendships and partnerships with your colleagues.", "cons": "The size of the Talent Acquisition Department is one of its biggest flaws.  Everyone is a number.  While you typically do get personal treatment from your manager(s), ultimately you are just one recruiter in an office full of 30 others, so the most attention you'll get is when something went wrong or if you already have a good friendship/relationship with your manager(s).\r\n\r\n* Turnover is too high for a role like this.  Great contractors are hired all the time, and rarely ever get brought on board permanently.  Most are let go early because they aren't performing, but that's mainly due to...\r\n\r\n* Poor training.  I remember when I was trained, I sat in a room with one of my colleagues while they spoke about how to do things...many times a day over the course of a week.  It was frustratingly boring and things haven't changed - they take new hires into a room and sit down and talk about how to do things.  I've delivered said training before and have had more than one trainee nearly fall asleep from boredom.  Having done the same myself, I sympathized.  That's STILL how we do it today.\r\n\r\n* People get burnt out and check out.  That's really the only reason people get terminated is they just get so burnt out from the monotony of the role that they just stop caring.  Morale is LOW. The fact that we have...\r\n\r\n*...way too many requisitions assigned to a single person has a lot to do with that.  The average specialist has anywhere from 50 - 100+ requsitions assigned to them.  The same burden is often put on new hires and they are unprepared for the extent of this, despite whatever background they may have come from.\r\n\r\n* Hot headed hiring managers make it miserable.  Of course your position is urgent...EVERY position is urgent in the hospital system!  They don't care about any other location's position though, only theirs...so that argument is rendered moot.  The hiring managers have a tendency to get impatient, angry and often try to go around you or over your head to your manager.  Seeing that we are required to put a message in our e-mail signature encouraging people to contact our managers for any reason, the complaints come in steadily enough.\r\n\r\n* Pay rates for positions are adequate but on the low end of the spectrum.  We are told to offer the lowest pay rate for the position, and only can go to the mid range after a lengthy, exhausting process of appealing and trying to convince management why the candidate is worth more than the bare minimum.  It's a challenge and sometimes goes to the highest levels of the organization.  Forget ever offering the high end salary range...it doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n* Rules and regulations differ from one hospital to the next, and the process for dealing with the different union, non-union, exempt, special and whatnot situations gets tiresome. \r\n\r\n* Creating offers is a lengthy, often frustrating process that requires lots of cross-checking of archaic excel spreadsheets.  Northwell desperately needs a system to manage this. \r\n\r\n* Political environment is a bit too blatant - we were recently \"strongly encouraged\" at a Town Hall event to vote for a specific candidate in the recent presidential election.  We were told that voting for her opponent would be \"stupid\" and \"moronic\".  Cardboard cut out \"standees\" and propaganda around the office of said candidate was distracting and frustrating."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Case Management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Nov 2015", "job_title": "RN Case Manager in Manhasset, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management very skillful and knowledgeable and share their knowledge with you.
