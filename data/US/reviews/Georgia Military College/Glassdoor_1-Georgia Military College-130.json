The school seems to have an endless supply of money and fundraising energy for flashy new things that it thinks will win it brownie points with big donors and Milledgeville, but simultaneously grumbles on about the employees wanting pay that isn\u2019t way below industry standards (I could make double what I make not working in rural Georgia where they use the relative poverty and and low cost of living to screw you out of potential earnings). It\u2019s all stick and no carrot, and if you even ask about a carrot, you\u2019re going to be seen as a rebellious employee by HR. Your reward for a job well done is not getting chewed out. You\u2019ll gradually become infuriated with the feel-good, bootstrap corporate propaganda they put out internally which thinly masks the fact that they would rather an employee quit than have to entertain the idea of paying them what the market deems to be a fair price for their talent.\r\n\r\n2. Executive incompetence\r\n\r\nGMC\u2019s Lack of drive to modernize and normalize its workplace to 2020 standards is primarily the fault of its executives. Antiquated boomers and wacky generals waiting to retire and get their max pension benefits - the executive administration has no vision, no heart, and no will to find either. This lack of leadership trickles down and is palpable in the absolute lack of professionalism some employees show to one another. You will encounter people making 2-3x your salary who don\u2019t know how to use essential Microsoft office software applications and wonder how they\u2019ve managed to work for so long not knowing how Microsoft office functions , only to realize you answered your own question. \r\n\r\n3. Fear-based work culture\r\n\r\nWe have office bullies. My office actually has multiple office bullies at the moment. Be prepared to be manipulated and made to feel anxious. \r\n\r\nHR will snitch on you for coming to them for help. They will immediately call your director and tell them everything you said in confidence. HR is there to protect the school and the executives. They will not protect you from your toxic work environment because they are the ones enabling it.\r\n\r\nExecs and directors don\u2019t trust employees to do their jobs, I\u2019m guessing because those paranoid about something generally engage in the very act they are paranoid about.
