There is a massive centralization campaign going on right now across all schools, bringing all the staff further under the umbrella of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. With this change, there has been upheaval in how things are managed. Non-union members haven't gotten a raise in 2 years that exceeds inflation (join a union folks), and we were told this is because the endowment hasn't performed well. Raises are tied directly to how well the endowment performs, and are only tangentially related to performance. In most cases (I'm sure there are exceptions) working harder or smarter will not result in better pay. Many administrative positions are being cut and outsourced to 3rd party vendors. When people leave, their positions are not filled, and the work falls on those left behind. Communication surrounding these issues is extremely poor. Major decisions that will directly impact your work will be decided by 2 or 3 people at the top, and they'll forget to tell you. My guess is they will continue to squeeze workers in order to cut costs. Within my unit, it feels like it's reaching a breaking point.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most highly political environments I've ever worked in. Prepare to ingratiate yourself to whoever is at the top of the chain in order to advance your career. Doing good work is not going to cut it.\r\n\r\nI have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to graft and waste, and it is mind boggling. If you get into a place where you can see some of these budgets, your head will spin. The people at the very top use their budgets to pay their friends $$$$$$$$ to do make-work. I believe this is called \"networking\".\r\n\r\nBorderline, there is no culture. Our \"retreats\" have been things like going to a classroom, and doing a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats chart to figure out how to be more efficient workers. \r\n\r\nOverall, I'm surprised not to see any of these complaints more prominently in the newer reviews given the discussions I've seen internally.

That is the elaborate trap that sucks in hundreds of postdocs every year.

Our savings (if we have any are exhausted) by the 25th of the month we have no money for food and on top of that we are called to work late nights weekends, holidays, snowstorms and even when the city is in lockdown. And this is doing a conservative life. Imagine this now, but also being naive that you can start a family. Who you think you are? Start a family? Oh no... Absolutely no. I have one. I work as a line-cook to a restaurant to get by. Guess what/ My work there is recognized a lot more. I get paid a more compared to the hours I put. \r\n\r\nAnd things get worse.

They tell you that we don't keep postdocs here for more than 3 years because \"it is not good for you\". Instead the promote you to \"Research Associate\" to advance your career. What they don't tell you is that you are still a postdoc that will still be overworked and underpaid and you will only get paid 5000 more. Yes this is it folks! PhD 3+ year of postdoctoral experience and you get $50,000. What a job! Who wouldn't want that. Here spend the rest of your life like this. I call it modern day educated \"slavery\".  We are there because we love what we do. We are willing to pay our dues, but at the end of the day it is coming to doing what we love or living decently.\r\n\r\nThe PIs are keeping you to help them and there is no interest to advance your career.

You are mid thirties living with a roommate, no prospect of family and no prospect of promotion.\r\n\r\nHarvard Administration does nothing to protect us from this. They willing look the other way and allow this perpetuate. Postdocs are highly trained, results producing machines that are used, literally used, to promote faculty. Went he money runs out you are just out. No interest in what you will do, no care and remorse. It's on you. \r\n\r\nIt is the worst place to work in academia.
