Harvard attracts people who are looking for cutting edge research experience and who need the Harvard brand name to continue on in their own pursuits.  Therefore, Harvard knows that it can pay entry level researchers badly and still retain top talent. For instance, my research team has structured my pay so that they can avoid paying me benefits. This means that I cycle between two pay periods--90 days in which I work for 35 hours a week and then 60 days in which I work 17 hours a week. This allows them to classify me as \"less than part time\" in order to pay me less and avoid providing me benefits.  The result is that I make less on an annualized basis than I would make flipping burgers at McDonalds for 40 hours a week, especially when the health insurance benefits from McDonalds are factored in. This creates a situation in which young people of means can afford to be research assistants while young people who do not have family backing must find other work. Harvard's union is supposed to be fixing this problem, but they are worthless and do not have the employee's interests at heart.

You have to be content to be low person on the academic totem pole:  Harvard, like most universities, is hierarchical.  A major downside is that the attitude toward inter and intra workgroup communication varies widely from school to school and from department to department.  In some offices at Harvard, you can go for years without being introduced to others in your 25 person department who are outside your 5 person division. This every-tub-on-its-own-bottom philosophy can lead to process wheel-reinventing; unless a faculty member champions a particular innovation, no one else will learn of it.  Harvard Medical School's finance, grant management, education, facilities, and human resource offices all have good reason to share information internally via newsletters and updated websites, yet to my knowledge none of these groups reaches out to share information with faculty and staff on a regular basis (probably because they have to spend so much time arguing procedures/policies with their counterparts on the Cambridge campus).  Also, it is very difficult to find a better job within Harvard unless you are staying in the same school - inter-school transfers/promotions are very rare."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "cons and pros at Harvard University", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Jun 2010", "job_title": "Researcher in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at Harvard has some advantages, which allow you to become better if you want to be.
