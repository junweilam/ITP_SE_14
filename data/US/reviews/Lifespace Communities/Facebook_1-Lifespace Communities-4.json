Both residents and employees are too upset and angry for any of it to work.\r\n\r\nLifespace will most likely outsource you to another company that often pay better. Now think about that for a minute. You bring in a company to do things cheaper that pay their own employees better? That right there is a huge hint on what is wrong.\r\n\r\nProfiting off of a non-profit organization.", "cons": "15 years ago there was a 2 year waiting list for the Village on the Green, one of Lifespace's communities. That is how popular and wonderful the place was. Now there are 35 empty apartments out of 250. That is the worse it has ever been and the trend indicates it will only get worse. This means loss of income which in turn results in more services being cut which in turn upsets the customers who move out or bad mouth the company to their friends who should be potential customers. The typical strategy when you have a product that doesn't sell is to lower the price. Lifespace does the opposite and raises prices which causes more customers to move out.\r\n\r\nThe grounds crew, the security staff, and dietary management have all been outsourced within the last year. Hours for maintenance, housekeeping and dietary have been cut within the last month. The company calls these \"cost cutting initiatives\". It actually is a sign of a desperate company about to fail."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Can't get much worse???

Executive Director is on drugs or acts like it, awful directors unqualified some without degrees and some are alcoholics everyone looks the other way - do as I say not as I do I suppose, don't get involved just do your job yeah that works. home office what a joke these people are unintelligent sinking us like the titanic, increased by 117% lining their pockets while no raises for us, laughing down at the Communities, spa days and lobster dinners while residents lose services great use of residents $. Go talk to HR yeah right they just go tell on you and you get in trouble. They treat team members \"beneath\" them like dog crap. Refuse to allow vacation earned vacation at that!! yet in same breath \"promote a balanced work/home life\" take time off you'll pay for it after with a Smerk on their face. Then they go take time off right after what a great feeling. expect to squeeze more out of people using scare tactics which results into the opposite - a horrible environment, don't you have common sense, promote a happy and healthy thriving environment and your \"people\" will produce and go above the norm. No feeling of job security quite the opposite. No trust in this company just stepping on people and reality tv drama shenanigans. Keep your head down there worker and get back to work. Embarrassed to work 4 such a despicable company. All about $$$ now. HO won't be happy until everyone leaves but then who will be in the communities. The residents and team members suffer daily and are mad as heck. Get told one thing one day then something opposite the next day and it's your fault you are confused! Massive confusion and no structure too much OCD control we are not children. When will the BOD step in and eliminate CEO and HO. It will be too late. Promote from within stop bringing on your prior buddies, this is real life maybe the members from within you already know will say no so you bring in the poor ignorant new people- they'll find out they always do.
