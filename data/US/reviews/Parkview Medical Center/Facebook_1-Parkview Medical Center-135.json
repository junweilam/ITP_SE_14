This is honestly my biggest complaint. A task as simple as checking a blood sugar can take an inordinate amount of time when patient touch devices lose service or crash for no apparent reason. Glucometer scanners are hypersensitive and inadvertent scanning of blood band or other barcodes results in threats of mandatory education or locking nurses out of using glucometers entirely. Pt. touch devices are programmed to ask nurses for illogical follow-ups (yes, I really did give that 30 mL of prostat, why am I charting this twice?) Pharmacy techs are routinely rude when answering the phone and medications can take HOURS to arrive despite multiple calls and requests, despite being ordered stat. It is simply accepted among nursing staff that when ordering many things in meditech, for example an enteral feeding pump or formula, one must also call sterile stores or distribution or the item wont arrive for hours. Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Speech therapy generally do an excellent job but at times are impossible to find (patients need these services on weekends just as much as weekdays). These are just examples of a generalized problem of stacking tasks on nurses. Unfortunately, this takes time away from patient care. Also, the idea of retaining staff would be better served by across the board raises for: critical care, period. The acquisition of advanced certifications. Having a bachelors degree These are clear cut rewards and would be better at retaining gifted staff instead of a highly complicated and somewhat arbitrary tier system.
