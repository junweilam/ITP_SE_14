My unit comprised of many soon-to-be retirees, meaning many of the large issues at hand turned a blind eye because of complacency and impending retirement. \r\n         I was misinformed about what my schedule would be on the interview versus what the reality is, which I spoke out on. Patient care standards are very low at times and many docs pass the buck around, by the time anyone gets around to helping the acute urgent issue at hand the patients fall thru those cracks causing them to be worse off then they needed to be, had someone acted faster. Safety of patients, and standards of care came into question weekly, I approached management and HR, unfortunately the hospital has high census, meaning they have to deal with that first ensuring the flow of patients in and out, causing many of these issues to fall to the wayside and only to re-emerge as urgent situations, which happens.\r\nlarge teaching hospitals have a lot checks and balances, standards in place, rankings to consider and are on the offensive, setting high standards. This hospital seems to be running on the defensive, if ever they can catch up.  Manager seems to be a middleman, without having much executive power. It's not magnet, and they have a higher census coming in then their own capacity even allows for causing patients to back up in the ED and any unit that has rooms especially the post sugical unit. They will attempt to alter acuity of a patient to move them to a room that's available, even though that patient may require closer monitoring then that unit provides.\r\nCompensation is no more better than nearby. i would try not to be a patient here."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good,  but sometimes disorganized", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Lewes, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone works together like a family", "cons": "Like with families, they can be dysfunctional.
