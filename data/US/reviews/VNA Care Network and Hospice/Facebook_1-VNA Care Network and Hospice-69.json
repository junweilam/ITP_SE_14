Do not apply here. From the outside this company has a very strong reputation within the community for being a wonderful nonprofit that cares for patients in their homes and throughout end of life care. That is really where it stops. Throughout my experience here, I have to agree that a majority of the nurses and therapists that are employed here are truly wonderful with the patients and really do go above and beyond to help, regardless of what that means they themselves have to sacrifice. Now switch gears to what it\u2019s like on the inside:\n\nCons: Under qualified management. Overpaid \u201csupervisors\u201d and favored employees that received their titles or pay raises simply because they share a last name or hometown with a higher up. Increasing workloads. Embarrassingly decreasing benefits including constantly rising employee contributions and a total discontinuation of employer 401k contributions. No pay raises across the board regardless of work ethic, length of dedication to the company or performance based merit. We receive the minimum legal amount of accrued sick time and when you want to use it you are denied or at the very least hassled and told your reasoning is unqualified or that you don\u2019t actually have any time (which is more than often inaccurate and can be easily verified by the Payroll department). A typical day here feels like you are trying to ride a bike with square tires. Unproductive, inefficient and frustrating. We are told that we\u2019re \u201clucky\u201d to have \u201ctreats\u201d that some other offices don\u2019t have the \u201cluxury\u201d of receiving such as splenda, spoons and real milk in the refrigerator for coffee. Good luck finding basic supplies to even complete your task (if you do ignore all of these warning and take the job regardless of these reviews I suggest stockpiling your desk - which will probably be broken - with supplies as often as you can because more often than not, you can not find it when you need it). \n\nThis company is marketed by HR as an appealing place to apply your skills. It\u2019s not. The vision statement here at the VNA is \u201cTransforming care to improve lives\u201d. I\u2019ll tell you what - you life will be transformed if you chose to come on board here but probably\nnot in the ways that you were hoping for. You\u2019ll find yourself in one of two categories: invincible or dispensable. The favoritism here is disgusting and blatant and management and HR absolutely can not be trusted. \n\nLastly, employees are sent a letter annually requesting they donate a portion of their paychecks or a donation in any amount back to the company. The same company that is no longer giving out raises or matching 401k or allowing you to use your own earned sick time. \n\nPros: If you\u2019re lucky enough to work here long enough to attend one of the \u201cchristmas parties\u201d you could wind up with a new can of paint or shake weight in the yankee swap, at the very least you\u2019ll get a cold plate if eggs and stale danish. Also, you can kill a few minutes every week watching the required weekly videos sent via email from the new CEO.
