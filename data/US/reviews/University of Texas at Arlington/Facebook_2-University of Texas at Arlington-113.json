However, a fairly significant amount is left, but no one knows how it's spent.\r\n\r\nThe level of disorganization at the top is excessive, and when they realize the house of cards may topple, they scramble to pull something together that might look good to the outside but puts even more burdens on staff, for example, 49 new initiatives a couple of years ago and 41 new teams recently (though to be fair, a few of the teams existed previously and were just slotted into the new structure). Salaried workers are expected to work 50+ hours a week with no formal comp time, though they are told they can take a few hours off during slower weeks to make up for it. Problem is, there are never slower weeks, so at best they might leave a bit early on a Friday. Salaried and hourly workers are overworked, understaffed, underresourced,  demoralized, and super stressed out.

Resumes and qualifications were not considered at all.  Almost a 100 people were shuffled around into a completely new structure.  Let me be clear - a resistance to change is not the issue here.   This action was a complete disregard for staff and the customers we serve.  There was no clear vision to what the outcome would be or how this would improve customer service.   After the reorganization training for people in new positions was pathetic.  People are struggling to learn and create their job duties in some cases.  There were huge holes left in the public service areas.  Absolutely no regard was given to processes and work flow at the library.   Efficiency has gone way down because there is no communication between departments concerning procedures or specific job duties.   The administration manages with fear and domination tactics to take advantage of the staff.   Open communication is nonexistent between staff and the administration.  There is major secrecy about the library budget and use of funds.   Needless to say the morale, quality/consistency of work, and the past friendly work environment has crumbled.    It\u2019s very sad to see a place collapse because of the incompetence of poor leadership.   So it\u2019s now the middle of 2014 and instead of evaluating library processes and what worked/did not work with the new structure administration has instituted 49 initiatives the whole staff will participate in developing.   Many are extremely vague.  To say the environment is chaotic and oppressive would be an understatement.  Many excellent employees have resigned or retired because they got fed up.  More people are desperately trying to get out."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Arlington, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You could work on homework if you weren't needed to do anything else.\r\nThe employers were very appreciative and showed it.\r\nThey always had leftover food that you could eat!\r\nThey always were fair and forgiving if you messed up. \r\nGot a raise every year.", "cons": "You didn't get to do any homework if you became a favorite student worker.\r\nSometimes some supervisors took their frustration out on you."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "My time as a UTA Library Student Assistant/Supervisor", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Arlington, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed my time working for UTA Libraries as a student assistant.

It is nice to work on a college campus, if you take the time to walk around a bit every day (not during the summer, of course, if you want to live). \r\n\r\nAs for the dept of management in particular, relatively low resources devoted to the PhD program means relatively low competition and honestly pretty low politics and petty conflicts (i.e. among faculty, but also other PhD students) to maneuver around. I have not heard of any PhD student being taken advantage of by unethical professors (e.g. stealing research ideas, crazy teaching loads), though in more competitive places, there are horror stories. In fact, unless you have teaching experience already and really want to teach, they don't make you teach until you begin your 3rd year, which basically allows you to finish your PhD classes before having to teach.", "cons": "In the way of personal disclosure, I decided to get a PhD because I have below average social skills (think high-functioning autism, aka Asperger's syndrome, aka whatever they are calling it these days). While people like me can certainly excel in academia, it can be hard to navigate relationships in a beneficial way in a program (such as this one) that does not have a structure in place for developing professional relationships with faculty.\r\n\r\nManagement's PhD has only very recently gone to the system where they offer students pay competitive with most mainstream state school programs. Relatively low resources devoted to the PhD program means that professors have basically no time to spend developing PhD students. You need to either come understanding how the research game works, or spend a lot of time figuring it out for yourself (or get forced out of the program, which on average seems to happen to one student per cohort). \r\n\r\nThere is an 'open door' policy, meaning that professors are open to hearing your research ideas, but unless your ideas really have legs, you aren't likely to get much helpful advice. Since the jobs that are worth going through a PhD to obtain are tenure track research positions, it is vital that you graduate with something published and are working with known researchers in the field (realistically this means UTA professors) on 3 - 5 other things if you want to land such a job. Therefore, it is a disservice to PhD students that things are run this way - and in all fairness, it is as much the result of relatively low funding as it is any individual professor."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "A university trying to grow but suffers from small thinking", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Arlington, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There is a massive groundswell to improve this university.

That isn't twenty words so I'll repeat, the building has a convenient central location on campus.", "cons": "If you walk into the building you will see shiny new equipment, re-imagined library spaces (such as the FabLab and various office suites for counselling, etc), and departments with students and staff alike working to generate online collections as UTA competes with other fine libraries to put our previously cloistered resources in a place where the world can make use of them. This is a good thing - but it comes at a steep cost and has squandered the personnel resources available in the library.\r\n \r\nThree years ago, after running extensive and exhausting (perhaps also exhaustive) studies, the library Administration felt they knew what students, faculty, and outside stakeholders wanted. The result involved taking most Library staff and librarians out of jobs for which they had applied and were well trained, and putting them in positions where they were ill-equipped to succeed. Department chairs were demoted and a few favored librarians received large bonuses, pay raises, and prestigious positions. These were, notably, also the people who had time to run those studies earlier in the year.\r\n \r\nWhat the administration failed to do before enacting this reorganization is two-fold: they didn't understand that many of us were doing the work of two and three positions because hiring was put on hold until the new dean arrived, and even then it didn't resume. Many of us were still too swamped to also participate in those studies. Second, the jobs we were appointed to, for most of us, were a slap in the face - they showed no understanding of what our actual job skills were and no acknowledgement of all of the extra work we had done leading up to the change.\r\n \r\nThis experience was across the board. Librarians, Library Assistants (there were four levels of LA here), and professionals in other support fields were haphazardly deposited in lower-level positions, while their original more interesting jobs were given to the favored librarians. Those employees who could left for other jobs, while some simply quit and walked away. Those who are older have had difficulties finding new jobs, partly because they were so severely wounded by the reorganization. Their job histories now reflect demotion - and who, as a new employer, wants to take a risk on someone who must have done something wrong to have this happen?\r\n \r\nLet me be clear: If we had seen these job openings during our original job searches with UTA, we wouldn't have applied for them. And if we had applied, we wouldn't have been considered qualified to do them. This reorganization was the singular most demoralizing event that has happened in this library in the decades I have worked here. Many of us lost status in the reorganization - this wasn't about breaking down silos - this was about discarding people at the top of their game and building new silos. Few of us now actually know what our co-workers in other departments are doing. And since the reset button was pushed on Sept. 1, 2013, we have lost more than 2/3 of the original staff of about 110 people.\r\n \r\nIn February library staff faced further demoralization when the library administration called all Library Assistants (1-4) and an administrative assistant into the parlor to announce a new big deal - we were all now going to be Library Specialists. So instead of occupying jobs that required some college, or at least a BA, we now only need a high school diploma or a GED. And to play well with others. The next day we were compelled to sign the papers changing our job descriptions, with little reflection and no legal consultation. And now all of those library staff, no long differentiated by rank, seniority, skill sets, and more, are tossed into a sweatshop with student employees and we are all doing the same thing. Scanning and posting metadata. Work that many of us would have never have applied to do. \r\n \r\nAn external review process is underway (July 2016), and has been thwarted by the library administration office. A report was supposed to be presented to staff for review who could then offer comments to outside auditors, but when meetings happened staff were clueless as to why the meetings were called and the auditors had to explain about a self-assessment completed by the administration office. Notetakers were present at the meetings, further intimidating staff who might otherwise have spoken about current conditions. Staff was already on edge due to the firing of two senior staff members three days earlier, in time to exclude their complaints from this meeting.\r\n\r\nIt's a tyranny of numbers staff are up against - it looks like the library is working because so many students and staff are turning out widgets, while others are discarding our print collection to make room for the new uses the dean has in mind for the building. Many of our new employees haven't quite figured out what happened here, but we've lost several of them recently as they realize promises were made that will never be kept. We're all supposed to tell a sunny story of the work our new administration office has done. But readers need to know that there are many truths involved in this story, and that this library functions in spite of the reorg, because library people are naturally helpful and gregarious. Eventually enough of the old staff will be replaced that this all might be moot. But we're not there yet, and those who survived the reorganization need to report out to someone who is actually paying attention to this activity and can offer some remedy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Resident Assistant", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Arlington, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diverse Environment, Leadership Opportunities, develop leadership, organizational, communication and conflict-resolution skills.
