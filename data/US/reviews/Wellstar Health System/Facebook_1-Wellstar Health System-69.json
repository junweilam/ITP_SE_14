Float pool requirements are unrealistic for a position that\u2019s supposedly PRN. I had to work 6 days a month, one weekend day a month at the urgent care, one major holiday a year and my schedule had to be set 8 weeks in advance, I couldnt pick which office I wanted to go to so essentially I could be scheduled to work extremely far from home with no mileage reimbursement. The office needs aren\u2019t verified so plenty of time I\u2019ve shown up to a fully staffed office that don\u2019t need additional help just to be rerouted to another office and not paid for mileage. The way they act like they are reimbursing you is to say you get paid for the time you clocked in and drive time to the next office. Well if I worked at the assigned office I would still get paid for the same time, save gas and have less mileage in my car. Not a even exchange. If  I showed up to a office that didn\u2019t need me there was no option to go home. I had to wait to get a call back from scheduling to tell me where to go next. A few times there weren\u2019t any other assignments available so I would only get paid for the hour that I sat waiting for scheduling to call me back. Reminder: I wasted gas and mileage driving to work that day. A lot of times I arrived at offices that had me scheduling appointments all day because the regular staff didn\u2019t want to. We held monthly meetings for our department but nothing would get corrected after our complaints were voiced. During the holidays it was suggested that we bring a pot luck meanwhile all other departments went into there petty cash to buy gifts or at least lunch for their employees. Last but not least no annual raises or monthly incentives for meeting goal"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Revamp the whole system", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Supply & Distribution in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It pays well and has food establishments available.", "cons": "\"That's the way it's always been\" culture.

Compensation not great for new employees, raises are very minimal, time-off policies and late/absence policies are excessive; expectations for healthcare staff are ridiculous when compared to the amount of time provided and corresponding compensation. There is a horrible lack of teamwork, petty \"cliques\" form within units, and management singles out specific people for reprimanding, as well as those who receive praise. Management definitely shows favoritism, and lacks empathy with their staff. The benefits starting in 2014 are HORRIBLE. Worst health insurance I have ever had; extremely limited choice of providers, exorbitant costs for any doctor visits. I have seen both management and staff employees show and make jokes concerning racism, sexism, lack of tolerance for minority groups, lack of support for those with different sexual orientations, and lack of support for those with differing political and religious beliefs. Staff attitudes are very right-wing, conservative, highly religious, and staff do not keep these opinions to themselves. If you don't fit into this specific group, you will be ostracized by your fellow coworkers. WellStar does NOT promote diversity in any way possible. Staff members are encouraged to \"tell\" on each other, instead of handling matters directly between themselves. Upper level management discuss and share specific issues relating to specific staff members with other staff members who are completely not involved in the issues at hand. I've never seen a place that gossips so incredibly much.
