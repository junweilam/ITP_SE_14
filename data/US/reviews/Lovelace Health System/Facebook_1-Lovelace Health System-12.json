I think Lovelace is on the right track, they are trying hard to change things and how they run for the better. Benefits are excellent.\r\n\r\nEach dept is different and luck of the draw. I worked 2 very different departments while I was there. One was good (inpatient), one not so good (outpatient). In my experience outpatient clinics aren't as busy, and are therefore breeding grounds for drama. My situation in the outpatient unit was unfortunate, as the \"new\" hire I tried desperately to fit into a well established clique. There were already 2 FT nurses, and as the third and newest hire guess who was the odd man out? My supervisor was spread very thin...she was over several departments. We could go days without seeing her, the only communication would be a daily morning text stating where she would be that day. She seemed disinterested in the goings on in our department and unaware of the problems. \r\n\r\nThe dept that was good was an inpatient unit. It was crazy busy, however, the people I worked with were amazing, helpful, kind, and truly a team. A busy dept will be hard work...but the time will fly and most people are way too busy to sit around and gossip, play on their phones, and start trouble. \r\n\r\nIn the interview process really take the time to interview them as well. Ask about their turnover rate, how they handle bullying, unfairness, etc. If you get a bad feeling, there's a reason for it! There is no hurry to accept or decline a position. Take your time and ask to interview many different departments and find people you feel good about who will treat you well. Look carefully at the employees that interview you. If they give each other side eye, roll their eyes, or patronize you during the interview you can guarantee that will carry over to your position as well. If you have a hard time during the first week of your job, ask for a transfer!! There are enough openings you can go where you will be happy and can find fulfillment. Don't try to stick it out for months hoping things will change. Put your own happiness and wellbeing first, because no one else will. \r\n\r\nHR is okay, just remember their job is ultimately to protect the company. So if things go south, you are on your own. \r\n\r\nRemember friends, there is a nursing shortage. Supply vs demand gives us the opportunity to improve our working environments.
