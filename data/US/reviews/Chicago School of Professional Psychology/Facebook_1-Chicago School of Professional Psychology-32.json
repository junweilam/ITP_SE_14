I can say with certainty, however, that the majority of staff and faculty are not happy at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology. The previous review also states that the PTO plan is great, but they state they are a faculty member. Faculty doesn't receive any PTO, so my guess is it was a review by someone in upper management meaning to mislead. Leadership is terrible and it starts at the very top. There is no transparency and they purposely mislead and manipulate people. If you have any integrity, you will be let go. If anyone challenges the president or certain members of the Executive Cabinet, they will be let go.
