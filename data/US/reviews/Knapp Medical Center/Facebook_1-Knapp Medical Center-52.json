I worked 7p-7a and cannot speak for day shift but I could tell the night shift was better prepared for the big emergencies like trauma and cardiac emergencies vs the day shift. The distribution of work was fare, everyone pulled their weight. Other staff members would help if you fell behind for whatever reason. The shift was Dr based if you had an ER physician that was good the ER flowed well if not it floundered. Lab was efficient, all lab collection done by phlebotomist, ECG and resp treatment were handled by resp therapy, xrays radiology. As a nurse, you were just responsible for managing your patient. Very team oriented approach it worked very well.", "cons": "All but one ER physician was ER trained but honestly the ER trained physician was okay the \"non-ER\" trained physicians about 80% of them were really good and thorough. There were some other physicians that were actually reading books after assessing patients which scared me to think that you had to be reading about what you possibly diagnosed, but I guess when you are starting out in medicine there is a learning curve, but to have been in practice for 10 years already you would figure the books would be used sparingly but not in this case. Lots of smokers on staff would go out for a smoke break frequently leaving all but 1-2 staff at times that was not good but never any disasters. House Supervisors were okay one of them would harass anyone who called in sick and practically make you seek medical attention in the ER. When you had a medical question she was clueless and I was clueless as how she got to be at that position. GNs hired were making more than staff nurses which was disheartening."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "great patient care team members", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 May 2017", "job_title": "Administrative Director in Weslaco, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great working environment \ngreat directors and managers\nemployees work as s team \nbenefits are excellent \nteam work is the best i seem", "cons": "over reaction decision by senior management or corporate leaders \nimprovements needed with physicians groups \nlack of understanding employees and or culture \nlack of corporate leaders communication or decisions directives to department leaders"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Helping patients get safely discharged out of the hospital was the best self-rewarding job I've ever done.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Apr 2015", "job_title": "Case Manager in Weslaco, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed my job very much.
