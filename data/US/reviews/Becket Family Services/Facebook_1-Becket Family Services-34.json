If you're wanting to move up there it\u2019s a lot of politicking that comes into play and people can be kinda to a lot of backstabbing if they also want the promotion. I found a lot of the job to be rewarding but there is this fake facade by upper management of we care about the gift (donor tissue) when in reality they care about the money and giving themselves bigger bonuses at the end of the year since they are a non-profit and the money needs to balance out at the end of the year. Some of the upper management that didn't have bachelor degrees and when they were forced to get them, the degrees were whichever bachelor degree was easiest to get for them. Then those people would be making very critical medical decisions or deciding on the direction of the company, and they did not have the background and/or education to be making such critical decisions. It's a mixed bag I worked there for almost 8 years and the negative wasn't noticeable till maybe after my first full year there since you have the rosy glasses on.

Company claims they have a tuition assistance program but it's very specific, medical-oriented degrees that not everyone has an interest in. Leadership is very out of touch with \"lower\" employees, they lack a lot of perspective, even those in leadership who have started from the bottom and moved up in the company. Despite this company using several forms of communication, they still greatly struggle with communication, which results in employee confusion. Leadership claim they will work on communication, but never do. Leadership makes promises that they frequently break, a lot of employees have become accustomed to not keeping their hopes up on certain things. If you aren't an easily social person, you will be left out and excluded from things. Workplace bullying is a major issue here, and often gets ignored by leadership because it seems they're all afraid of confrontation. Minority employees (LGBT+, POC, disabled, neurodivergent, etc.) receive disrespectful treatment, despite a yearly enforced \"harassment prevention\" meeting. There are verbally abusive people who aren't afraid to be rude to their co-workers because they know nothing will be done about it. Gossip runs rampant, I don't think I even heard this much gossip when I was in high school. Leadership almost encourages the gossip and works with a two-faced attitude. There is a clear amount of favoritism among leadership and other employees. Less favored employees continually receive lectures, are told that their work speed isn't enough, and are berated over simple mistakes. 1st shift is held to an extreme standard, the other shifts (2nd, 3rd, and Weekends) are held to a \"get away with murder\" standard, and are hardly held accountable, despite earning much more pay than 1st shift. Leadership also has tendencies to micromanage to an extreme, and not let their workers take simple breaks. Several employees take more than 5 minutes in the bathroom, and are interrogated why they were gone for a long time. Your time clock patterns are scrutinized down to the minutes, even seconds. Cameras are used within every room of the building and any actions deemed \"suspicious\" will be thoroughly questioned, with a \"guilty until proven innocent\" mindset. Conversations get listened to by those eavesdropping nearby. You have no sense of actual privacy when discussing matters with people, leadership has repeatedly broken anonymity with issues. A coworker reported workplace bullying to a manager, in which the manager informed the bully the specific person who reported them, resulting in the person being confronted and harassed. The moment you become somewhat familiar with something in the job, you will be forced to train a new hire, despite it being something you're not fully comfortable with. Expressing this issue will result in you being berated and told to go to another department, and a group lecture from out of touch leadership (that does not do the work we do) saying: \"Training is part of the job description. I'm going to need you to let go of your big egos and understand that. Get over yourselves.\" - Christina Watson, Manager of Dental Department All of this and leadership remains confused on why we have such a high rate of turnover (over 40%).
