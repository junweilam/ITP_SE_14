Regarding Diversity Equity and Inclusion, those involved are passionate and caring people and any effort made by staff members is truly admirable. Direct Support Staff are the backbone of the industry. Ultimately, people who are using Accra may not have many options and do need and deserve staff to fulfill needed cares so they can participate in their communities. The need for care is a right and I hope Accra and other agencies, and the state of MN and the US, improves things for all citizens.", "cons": "There is very little diversity in management and virtually none in leadership. While the company exists to provide care to people with disabilities, there are virtually no voices of disabled people represented in the office staff and leadership. \r\n\r\nA common thing I heard from BIPOC direct support staff was the inherent racism and prejudice in the systems in place.  As mentioned in my \"pros,\" there are a lot of staff involved in DEI that are passionate and caring. The problem is systemic and the problem is baked into the lack of diversity in leadership.\r\n\r\nWhat you will see as a \"con\" in other reviews on this site for this company will regard timesheets. Timesheets are filled out on paper and submitted to the main office for process and payment. There are a lot of regulations (put forward by the Department of Human Resources and other policies) that make timesheets difficult for many people to fill out perfectly. If there are errors on timesheets, they will see delay in payment. The paper timesheets are then entered manually by staff members. These staff members must manually enter thousands of timesheets every 2 weeks, and in the effort to be swift, there will inevitably be many errors, which also cause delays in payment or errors in payment for Direct Support Staff. Payroll is put in a position to process as many timesheets as possible, the adherence to the many rules regarding timesheets, and the pressure regarding budgets and funds. As happens in MANY businesses, the pressure weighs down on the people with the least power, and every level above is incentivized to protect themselves than relieve the pressure on the levels below. So, leadership sees revenue fall and says, \"we need to find $100,000\" and puts that pressure on the admin staff in their HR, Billing, Finance, and Payroll departments. That money does not belong to any of those staff, but the pressure from leadership makes them believe that they MUST defend every penny as if it were their own, and are incentivized to see fraud or bad intentions in every mistake. A Direct Support Professional will work 50, 60 or 70 hours supporting their client and will be warned they will be fired if they do not cut back their hours. The client will panic because they need care, and they are about to lose their staff, and thus the hours they were awarded by the State of MN are worthless to them. Accra likes to say that their org chart is leadership on the bottom, then managers, then admin then DSPs then clients at the very top. But these are just words. in reality, revenue is king. Leadership prioritizes revenue, pressures managers then admins to find and protect revenue, staff then become frustrated, and since the company making these changes is very hands off, they can only vent this at their client. Clients become stressed and stress is very linked to worsening health conditions. And, on the billing side, if a client is declared \"ineligible\" for services by the State of MN or goes over budget, they are given warning, but then discharged with a very hands off process. I will say, very quickly, that one of the reasons that a company like Accra would be so protective of revenue, is that the system is precarious and all the way to the bedrock, is broken. The company, if it loses enough clients, will lose revenue  and will be less and less able to pay for staff, the same way that smaller agencies fall. \r\n\r\nThe State of Minnesota legislature decides on the \"reimbursement rate\" (the amount of money per hour that an agency can bill to insurance) and the minimum pay that DSPs can receive. Ultimately, we need to push legislature to require that a higher percentage of the \"reimbursement rate\" MUST be used for pay.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, there is a problem in leadership. The CEO does not respect women and especially young women. I do not mean that he is overtly disrespectful, rather, he will avoid speaking with women. I will reiterate, I have no knowledge or even reason to believe that he has ever acted inappropriately towards any women at the company; his problems are more regarding casual misogyny. He consistently mispronounced a woman's name for years while she worked their after being corrected multiple times by multiple people. He will easily meet consistently with men at the company, but look for reasons to not speak with women. This may seem like a harsh thing to say, but if you are leading a company in a part of an industry where women are  upwards of 75% of this workforce, you MUST be INTENTIONAL in EVERY action you do. The more power you have, the more responsible you are for the culture in the company you are running. A lot of clients and DSPs that have complaints regarding office staff and while I would never pretend that every office staff member is perfect, the culture is reflective of its leadership.\r\n\r\nWhile Direct Support Staff are the backbone of the industry, they are not treated or respected as such. This is partially attributable to the state of MN and the way the country's lack of health funding. There is no development options for DSPs and even for staff in the office. Non-profits have to report their CEO's salaries, and I would encourage anyone who is looking to work for a non profit to review that information and, in particular, how CEOs' salaries were impacted during the pandemic and who made choices to take cuts to their own salary to support the staff doing the bulk of the labor."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Minnetonka, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Company values, caring people, lower pressure.
