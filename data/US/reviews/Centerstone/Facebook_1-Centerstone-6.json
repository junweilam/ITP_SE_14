We are constantly being double and triple booked, booked up for months out with no choice in saying we cant accept new clients, so we have people being seen once every 6-8 weeks, some of whom are suicidal. This has been brought up as an ethical issue, in which upper management shrugs. The pay is far below average, and we are constantly being overloaded with clients. We were told that lunch breaks do not count towards out work hours for the day, and paperwork must be done during work hours which is impossible, given how long the new online system takes. A careplan takes 45-60 minutes to complete alone. The new system was launched prior to completion due to the fiscal year starting, and it constantly has errors. Everyone is always being sent emails about how behind they are in paperwork and billing errors and careplan incompletion because the system doesnt notify us as it should. We are not given any professional development time or paid trainings or ceu's. We were told if we wanted to attend a conference to use our pto. Nothing between clinics is consistent. The duties of a supervisor or therapist at one clinic varies from others. There were inconsistencies amongst pay, as well as job expectations even at our own clinic. Recently the higher ups did a MASS LAYOFF, and let go several employees across multiple offices due to budgeting and financial issues. Employees were given NO WARNING, and told to turn in their things immediately. No goodbye party, no transition sessions for clients, nothing.

If you do not meet these productivity levels you are threatened with repercussion and possible termination. In turn you are always stressed out and fearing that you could lose your job for something that is often times out of your control. (clients ALWAYS cancel, making it impossible to meet productivity) Management, aside from a couple amazing bosses, is terrible. They don't encourage you or reinforce you for doing well, terrible morale.  Employees are constantly leaving and again, there is a very very high turn over rate, in my two years I don't think they have ever been fully staffed.  The employees who have made it this long are always shocked when a new employee makes it longer than 3-6 months.

It's hard work and no matter what CMHC you work for, you're never going to make as much money as you deserve.

If you are in administration position, this does not effect you yet for those of us who work with clients day-in and day-out, this impacts us and our own mental health by being reprimanded and written up if we do not meet our productivity for having taken time off.  Getting under 90% means you're getting a corrective action even if that is 89%.\r\n\r\nRecently Centerstone employees were asked to complete this survey in order to make Centerstone look better; Recently there have been perfect scores correlating with this request which do not match the atmosphere of the business or the model Centerstone management claims to have to potential employees such as you.\r\n\r\nI am a full-time employee with Centerstone. The current productivity requirements cause a great deal of stress and employee loss; additionally, most rehab specialists are expected to carry 25+ (pushing 30+) clients on average per staff which does not provide quality client care or \"Delivering care that changes people's lives\" as their motto states.  Instead, it keeps clients at Centerstone for long term by providing minimal services at the cost of their mental health and yours.  Furthermore due to the \"State of Emergency\" in which Centerstone finds itself in, staff are expected to take on additional roles (*with out* compensation or adjustments) and are held accountable when they are not able to meet their 'days to chart' in a 40/hr week (see above).\r\n\r\nThe pay scale is beatable by other employers whether for profit or non-for profit; within state or in surrounding states. Additionally, living in Bloomington, IN we have the highest living cost of living in Indiana and Centerstone does not pay to reflect. We are considered the working-poor.\r\n\r\nWhen you communicate with your management, they say and pretend to take your objective views and concerns into consideration yet do nothing about it and if anything, do the complete opposite in which your counselling advised them of.  Shoot -\r\n - even the HR Staff themselves do not support you! and will undermine you and make you feel worse for having attempted to constructively address your concerns to improve the quality and worth of the company yet instead, chose to have parties as if it is the real problem why we lose employees all the time. \r\n\r\nThe parties do not retain staff; however, those few staff who work together keep each other afloat for the sake of our clients in this hostile atmosphere they promote. Yet due to the current atmosphere, you can not form work relationships with your staff as a result of pressure from meeting productivity, days-to-chart requirements and trying to keep your 25+ clients okay.\r\n\r\nTurnover with this company is extremely high due to these reasons listed. If you are a social worker, please treat yourself with respect that you deserve.

That is very sad because my pros are pretty amazing. Rarely do I feel like my above pros are actually reality in my job and in myself because cons of the organization overpower the reasons the job could be so great. Centerstone's system of \"productivity\" sets up one for failure. Due to poor management, lack of general care and support for their employees, and a complete disregard when employees voice their concerns, Centerstone is not a positive place to work. Add that to the already existing pressure, heaviness, and workload of the job, and you're looking at a complete mess. I am underpaid and overworked. That is to be expected in this field, but my main disappointment is how little I am valued by my organization. For reasons that I cannot control (getting sick, clients not showing up for appointments, etc) I have never, not once, met the hours of care standard. I passively aggressively get condemned for this, and I go to work with anxiety every day. And no real, ethical solutions are offered to me to fix the \"problem.\" And I have a lot of responsibilities that directly affect people's lives that I'm juggling, but that's not considered by management. I bend over backwards constantly to make sure my clients get the support they need, I encourage them, coordinate with other providers, and I pour out my heart and soul because I am passionate about people. That has never been valued, recognized, or reinforced. All my superiors care about is how much \"revenue\" I produce. I see coworkers (and myself) often sacrificing quality in their work with clients so that they can be in good standing with their bosses. In turn, clients end up not getting the boundaries they need to be independent because the employees are so worried about not making their hours of care. And I know I'm not alone. Every coworker I have talked with has expressed this.  All of this leads to one conclusion in my mind: an organization that does not care about their employees does not care about their clients.
