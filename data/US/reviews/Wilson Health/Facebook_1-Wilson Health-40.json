Lack of integrity. Lack of pride in their work. Lack of accountability. Focus is on money and fiscal gain. Corners are cut. Physicians have zero accountability for extremely poor patient care. Upper management plays favorites to the point its so obvious but they dont care. Upper management plays stupid and uniformed when they make mistakes instead of taking accountability and fixing it, which is just astonishing to witness. Leadership dictates with fear tactics and a \"do as I say not as I do\" attitude. Nursing leadership is an absolute cancer to that hospital and the people at the very top allow it all to take place, as they are completely out of touch with what even goes on at their own hospital. They care more about how they look in the community vs actually caring for the community.
