For one of his exams, that particular professor failed to communicate with his TA's and his students that he had decided to postpone the exam two weeks.  He didn't respond to our emails or clarify the situation until several days after the original exam date had passed.  Meanwhile, his students had studied and made arrangements in their schedules anticipating to take the exam during the originally-scheduled period/date and had been anxiously checking the online course page for the exam to unlock or for news from the professor explaining otherwise.   After that incident, I notified my manager who then notified the department dean who then talked to the professor and rectified the situation for the most part.
