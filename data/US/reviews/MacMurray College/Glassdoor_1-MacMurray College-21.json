Only candidates with master's degrees are hired, but the salary and lack of benefits do not merit the type of talent CollegeTracks seeks to add to the team. Within a one year period 7 of the 12 staff members left the organization because of poor salary, negligible benefits, lack of professional growth opportunities, and frustrations with not being able to create change within the organization. A current employee is contemplating getting on welfare because the salary paid by CollegeTracks does not allow for her to provide for her family. Employment and hiring practices are borderline illegal, one staff member that left was not paid for vacation time accrued, which is illegal. All staff members are \"at will employees\" and CollegeTracks has fired staff in the past with no explanation. While the job can be rewarding the organization and leadership is demanding, challenging to work for, and seems to care little about the welfare of its staff. There are other ways to make a positive impact on society other than by working for this organization."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Incredible Organization!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Volunteer in Rockville, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great mission with caring, dedicated people.", "cons": "I can't think of any cons."}], [], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Systems Administrator in Jacksonville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great atmosphere, good work environment", "cons": "None that I can think of"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good people", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Intern, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2021", "job_title": "IT Intern in Jacksonville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People were friendly and happy to help out", "cons": "Small school and town made it difficult to stay busy and continue to learn"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "School running out of money and desperate to take advantage of young employees", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2012", "job_title": "Coach in Jacksonville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Was able to start my career as a coach/teacher and gain a little experience", "cons": "This job was very rough for me being a student fresh out of college it was a horrible experience."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Not the Best", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Project Manager Intern in Bloomfield Hills, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Get to work in an environment that is filled with very talented professionals", "cons": "Often don't get the attention that is advertised for a small company"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Database Administrator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Database Administrator in Jacksonville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "College with a track record of empowering first generation students succeed in college.", "cons": "Located in small town without access to resources for research."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great school to work for that is slowly growing back.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Jan 2019", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Jacksonville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Summers and Winter breaks are nice", "cons": "Needs better pay and benefits"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "MacMurray College Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Professor in Jacksonville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great faculty, staff, and students", "cons": "Lack of long term planning"}], [], []]
