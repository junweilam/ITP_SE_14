Multiple staff out with serious injuries. Nurses viewed as an unfortunate overhead- are not members of the team and are not part of any decision making. Have never worked with Doctors and other disciplines that treated nurses this poorly. Talented nurse managers driven out or forced out. There is no culture of safety- any one who brings up concerns will pay the price. This is not a culture of safety or a high reliability organization. This a culture of shame and blame. Nurses bear the brunt of it- even as they struggle to retain nurses. Physicians go unchecked. The list of safety events is atrocious and unacceptable- and the most disenfranchised populations are the victims of this chaotic, short-sighted organization.
