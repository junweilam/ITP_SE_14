It is still not as robust as what it could be. Lack of guidance for how to get promoted - there are no clear pathways.  It seems that most people are hand selected based on favoritism."

            "cons": "The reason I said to not believe the positive reviews is because those are put out there by directors and higher-paid employees to make the university look better. They did the same with another online job review site, jobvent.com There were 10 negative reviews that mysteriously disappeared and were replaced with 3 stellar reviews all created on the same day. Shady, shady, shady. Some of the reviews may be legitimate, but I wouldn't hold your breath.\n\nManagement is constantly breathing down your neck to meet an enrollment quota that is unattainable given the current state of higher education. The recession is over and less people are going back to college. BU does not realize this, and increases goal every term, making it harder and harder to reach. When your raise is dependent upon your goal (they try to say it's based upon your reviews from students on your performance, but we all know that's not all) it makes it difficult to stay positive because you never know if your work is being appreciated.\n\nAnother note on the performance reviews - these are done by students and give a blanket overview of the entire enrollment experience from beginning to end. If that student had a poor interaction with someone in another department and decide to give every department a bad score, that score will affect you and your raise. Not entirely fair, in my opinion.\n\nDirectors and managers also place undue stress on employees and ask employees to stay late, come in on weekends, etc. If you are a salaried employee, these extra hours are unpaid. Then, you'll see every manager and director strolling out of the building at 5:00 pm on the dot, while you're stuck at your desk mindlessly working away.\n\nThe pay is horrendous for higher education. I know that not everyone takes a job because of pay, but when you have been with a company for years and are barely making $35K, that shows you something. I have seen other colleges and universities who start their employees out close to $50K. BU does offer a yearly bonus, which is a plus. The only drawback to that is the percentage fluctuates every year (it's normally between 10-20%) and then it's taxed 40% because it's considered a \"gift\".\n\nAll in all, it's not a positive work environment and not a job I hope to keep."

There's no focus on career paths, or individual career growth and development. If you like to float, that's great. If you're someone who actually wants to work, with passion for the job you were hired to do, stay far away. You will be very unhappy here. If you're into popularity contests, there's always the chance that you'll get lucky, and one of the senior managers will take an interest in your career and prop you up. But their interest is usually completely based on favoritism and not the typical qualities of managers, especially not talent, skills or work ethic. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this management/promotional tactic results in a lot of managers who don't have good people skills, haven't really done the work to earn the position, and worst of all: don't connect with their employees, and don't have a good understanding of how their employees get their work done every day. Because the managers don't really know what their employees are interested in, or even what they're good at, a lot of money is wasted on outsourcing things. Because everything is outsourced, employees sit empty handed, working on small, unimportant projects. They even hired a firm to come up with a name for a new program. The name was so terrible that it's not even in use anymore, because it didn't resonate with the target audience."
