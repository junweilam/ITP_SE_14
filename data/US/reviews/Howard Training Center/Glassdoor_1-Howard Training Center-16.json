You have to wait for work to arrive many days meaning you sit for hours doing nothing at the start of the day. Toward the end of my third year there, the Job Coaches had begun each slow day with a group meeting where they went over the same rules at times daily ever morning for an hour. I tried working in the kitchen for a short time and when I found the loads too heavy and returned with a doctor's note for accommodations they said they would not honor it even though by law they were required to do so. They gave me the option of dropping the issue with the doctor's note and continuing work in the kitchen or moving to another department with less work and lower pay that did not require such lifting of heavy boxes and trays. The law that requires clients be paid minimum wage verse the old system of being paid piece rate ($0.25 cents per item up to a few dollars per item on the higher end) it is unlikely they will be able to keep clients that use the program to socialize and do not work as hard as others and will not be able to pay as many clients to do the work. They have already lost contracts from companies who found other people that worked for cheaper and that is very likely to happen again with this change to the law."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good.
