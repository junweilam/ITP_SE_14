Usually food service staff will deliver snacks (2-qt ish bowls with apples, chips, bars) intermittently throughout a day, however this may be limited with stressed staffing levels. During high-populations weeks, there will commonly be a free meal served (typically on a Wednesday).", "cons": "Workplace stress is high. Many of the fellow co-workers are openly spiteful about working conditions and do not comment to avoid conflict (And wait their time out if near retirement age). Contacting HR or any other workplace service contact is frustrating as most offices are located from Sioux Falls and are staffed with individuals that do not care to humanize or relate to clinicians, or anyone outside of their metropolitan area. Overall balance of workplace duties is hard to manage and some tasks end up being overwhelmed both in workload and physical endurance. Training is treated like a burden rather than a duty and the department continues to use brand new employees to churn out more newly trained employees. This sense of rush is especially escalated with Tech IIs or IIIs, where lower managers are pushing seasoned employees to take a duty raise, for the mgmt purpose of being able to allocate more duties to freshly promoted techs. There is no standard of quality control through the training process (outside of IAHCSMM certification acquired within 2 years of hire) and there currently is no \"training the trainer\". Within this area, there are a lot of encounters with adjacent OR staff, and when issues occur, it can take far longer to communicate across all micro-departments, due to the separation . This division was especially problematic during the time of COVID, both in rationing of PPE and unsafe/improper use of PPE (once no longer in short-supply). Similarly, there are still struggles with purchasing acceptable PPE for decontamination staff, as many weeks during 2021 resulted in boot-covers being used as replacements for impermeable bouffant head-covers. The building conditions at the Broadway OR/SPD are both depressing and deteriorating. Two ORs had to be fumigated for bugs during my time, and the remaining 11 rooms were in various states of cleanliness, often with OR staff leaving unused opened sterile gloves or wrappings in in-room storage to try to repurpose for the next service. The SPD department is also languishing with an assembly area missing 30% of computers, repeated water damage to the ceiling tiles due to roof leaks, poor air ventilation, frequent leaks to plumbing, and air-ventilation systems are caked with dust. Additionally, the scrubs distributed through the hospital side of the facility widely vary in quality and size availability and there were many weeks my size would be mispackaged in the scrub vending machine, or the set was in such poor condition, I could have shredded my set if I overstretched or mis-stepped. There were little to few resources available to avoid ergonomic-related injuries. A few examples of helpful resources we could have used include: adjustable height monitors for all work-place PCs, kneepads for any in-depth cleaning or major organization, adjustable standing desk (particularly for the dispensing window), more seating and stools that included back support. \nLastly, I was frustrated and distraught to learn that due to lack of staff, the majority of my initial training was conducted with a team member who refused to be vaccinated for COVID-19, despite my prior concerns to my supervisor that I was taking this position largely to seek COVID precautions and safeguards in my workplace. Upon learning this individual was anti-vax weeks after(through their public outburst) I felt discounted and silenced about my concerns to management."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Staff nurses are leaving to travel due to pay", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Fargo, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Teamwork.

When I finally complained to HR they told me \"that is just how healthcare is and you knew what you were getting into.\" After complaining to HR my supervisor became increasingly more hostile and angrier and she started using half truths to fabricate reasons to write me up. For example, the nurses came in a threw a bunch of covid samples on the counter while I was drawing a patient so my supervisor wrote me up for \"leaving the lab messy and in disarray.\" I scheduled a few meetings with HR to argue my case but again they blamed me and argued \"we all must make sacrifices\".

Small town, short drive.", "cons": "We got a new boss, same age as me but with a giant inferiority complex and the perfect mix of a right to work state (ND). It started when I was told I was not to be looking up HR/employee policies, that I just need to accept what the managers said is  policy, and DON\"T question it. The manager was lying and contradicting HR written policy and would get angry when caught in a lie. After that meeting I knew I was not going to last very long.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward came the attempts at isolation from the work pod. The boss would get in little digs when she could, publicly pointing out how she hated my laugh, etc. The straw that broke her back though was when I caught her trying to remove information from a patient's electronic medical record so the patient would then qualify for a research study (ignoring the risk of drug interactions). She then quickly acted on my termination which happened about 1 week later.\r\n\r\nThe worst though was the one office sheep, who I considered a good friend (several times we went to movies, golfed, dinners, etc). The boss specifically told my friend of her plan to fire me and my friend was directed to write down every possible thing I did 'wrong', like leaving for break from a door not located next to the bosses office (Really HR...really?). The \"friend\" complied and 90% of what she wrote was complete lies that never even happened and the rest was colorfully embellished or ridiculously mundane, like the above \"door insubordination\". HR did nothing to investigate if any of it was true; HR's only role is to protect the manager and protect the business. I had double digit years of stellar reviews from 5 different departments, including my last review which was approx 60 days before I was fired.\r\n\r\nI found out this plan because the \"friend\" is unable to keep a secret to save her life. A different office mate transferred out a few months after I, who then felt safe filling me in on the details on how the \"friend\" told the office mate that there was a plan in place to \"document\" events to ensure a few of us were fired, and that my \"friend\" was specifically asked to be instrumental in providing the boss with this false documentation. All apparently with HR's blessing (because if someone wrote it down it was then considered true and not hearsay). \r\n\r\nHere is a tip, if you file with the EEOC, after your case is closed you can request a full copy of your personnel file. I knew my case would get nowhere in a right to work state, but I did get a copy of my entire work & EEOC file and I was able to read word for word the lies my \"friend\" wrote. \r\n\r\nAll in all, getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to me.  I relocated, was hired at a 20% pay increase compared to the salary I was making when fired and the retirement fund I was forced to cash in to live on has nearly doubled at my new employer. All annual reviews are same as my previous employer - stellar. Shortly after relocating my personal life also changed for the better as well. I can't say the same for the boss. Her life played out publicly in the news with some horrible karma - which I did not really believe in until I read what happened to her and the likes of which I would never wish on anyone!\r\n\r\nYears later, the only one thing that still stings a little - the gal who I thought was a friend turned out to be such an evil person.
