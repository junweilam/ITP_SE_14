I have great experiences working in different departments as a hokie alum. It is just to my surprise, that this particular experience in admin/education is horrible and toxic.\n\nThe admin/education side is really meant to work closely with students, which is the most vibrant element of the community. However, the majority of the people I worked with all seem to be ready for retirement without too much energy. They can be energetic when bragging about the \"big things\" but the purpose is to really impress and inflate performance reviews for pay raises or promotions, in reality, they aren't doing anything that contributes to any factual development. \n\nThey asked me at least 3 questions about diversity (I'm not white) during interviews, but it does not change the fact that is a predominately white institute governed by old white leadership and they do so little to engage the younger and diverse employees. I did not feel belonged at all! I've raised concerns about DEI but got no hear back from the leadership team, not even a reply in email. \n\nPeople do not take responsibility for what they say or do because no one seems to care enough. Seniority exists in a way that hurts morale and engagement, I worked with an employee who is in a position long enough but for some reason, they just keep making simple mistakes, instead of being transparent about it, they would choose to cover it up until is discovered. I'm not sure if the leadership does anything to help these employees grow despite a simple mistake that ended up costing $2000. I was told, instead, to respect people and be polite because I'm not accepting enough.\n\nIt is more ridiculous that at the end of the year during a performance review, the direct reports made comments about my personal values and ethics not being flexible, saying that I'm not cut out for this job because of this. The student admin/education side of the university just doesn't deserve to be served."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5,

I was told I would receive a salary increase after my 1 year probation, only took the job because of this promise, and the salary increase never happened. Instead, the individual I submitted complaints to the director about for that entire year received a promotion to assistant director.\r\n- During my first week of employment my immediate supervisor told me that he, \"regretted hiring me.\" He refused to collaborate with me for the rest of my employment.\r\n- This same immediate supervisor made inappropriate comments about my body.\r\n- This same immediate supervisor would not collaborate with the team and would demand things go their way if someone offered a different approach.\r\n- This same immediate supervisor was promoted to assistant director after all of the above issues had already been brought to the attention of the director.\r\n- Software development team with no documented standards operating on a out-dated codebase built without reading the framework's documentation. I rebuilt this codebase in two weeks, the director instructed the team to use it, and the team refused.\r\n- It was not uncommon to hear, \u201cthis is how it\u2019s done at Virginia Tech,\u201d when offering new solutions and alternative approaches.\r\n- Leadership can't be trusted - on any level."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Blacksburg, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Get to learn alot, supporting professors", "cons": "No Cons as such.
