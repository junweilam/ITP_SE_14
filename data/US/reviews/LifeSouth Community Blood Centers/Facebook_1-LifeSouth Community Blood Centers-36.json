We had to return to the center until they closed when we were supposed to be off by 2. I was literally told to sit there because there was nothing else to do and the 40 hours they promised me per week ended up being sometimes 25 hours per week which meant I could not accrue vacation or time off or get paid properly so I could pay my rent. Do not work there. Even after you leave other people who hire you do not want to accept lifesouth training because their standards are low and they wont do well in training you properly. Luckily I went to school and got certified and learned that the techniques they use are so far off.
