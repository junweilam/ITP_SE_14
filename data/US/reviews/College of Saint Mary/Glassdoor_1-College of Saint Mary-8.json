The students experience the high turnover and talk about their frustrations with so many adjunct teachers. Also, the students become entitled due to the president bending over backwards to try to keep them on campus. The micromanagement cannot be expressed more; they read emails, ask why you left for a restroom break, and chastise those who have children. There is zero training when you join the organization and yet rip you apart if you make a mistake (that was never taught to you). It's sad that these reviews have been consistent since 2011 and yet nothing has been done. If you approach HR, they shrug and say sorry we can't do anything.
