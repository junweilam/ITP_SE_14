For full-time that means almost an annual total of $46000 before taxes and deductions for health plan contributions, etc. (This is the master's degree base pay accurate example). If this job serves as a second household income, this may be work for you especially if you live in a rural area that has a lower cost of living. If you intend for this job to serve as your primary income and you live in an area that has a higher cost of living (West/Northeast Coast), this may be a deal-breaker especially if you also have kids. So, bottom line, yes, the colleagues are great and the flexibility of the schedule is also appreciated, but the reality is that common bills (rent/mortgage, groceries, utilities, etc.) must be paid every month, and even if you live frugally, in many parts of the USA, especially now, this salary offered by WGU serving as a primary income is simply not enough. This is not an exaggeration but a fact. I won't get into the fact that candidates are coming to the table with decades of experience and advanced degrees. Experience, degrees, cost of living where you are---none of these ever enter the equation when salary is offered, and of course, any attempt to negotiate falls flat. For those reviews claiming WGU offers a good wage/salary, I can only assume that they are referring to this as a part-time wage which meets their current situational needs as a student or retiree, they live in a rural area with a low cost of living, or this job is serving as a secondary source of income in their household."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Pay and promotion.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Course Instructor in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy job, flexible hours.

Go for the ones of substance, there have been rumors of HR padding these Glassdoor ratings for years, and given the recent LAYOFF of 160 people on 6/30/2021 it is no surprise that there are many of them with dates just prior to. \n\nAs a long time employee (who was not a part of this layoff) all I can say is it says University in the name but it is hardly close. The practices that still feel like those indicative of an educational institution are because of the Dept. of Ed\u2019s standards for accreditation. Everything else has taken on a metric-driven approach, with all aspects swapping their human touch for machine efficiency. (I am pro-metric, anti-metrics are everything) That\u2019s not to say jobs are being replaced by AI, but the jobs that are left are repetitive, tactful, and limit the personal touch. \n\nFrom my own experience I can honestly say leadership (from the C-suite to the Directors and VPs) are ill equipped for jobs in education, although they could very successfully run a Fortune 500 company. Perhaps 1 or 2 people at that level truly still care about education, any others who did have recently left. During my time here the culture has certainly shifted, most recently in the last two years. Constant reorgs accompanied with 0 to none communication were draining. Breaking your back for leadership that certainly doesn\u2019t care about you (reinforced by the recent layoff details scattered across Reddit) confirms this. \n\nI stayed as long as I did because I was truly obsessed with helping students and improving their experiences. When I learned of the inequitable pay and hiring practices impacting me I left. This isn\u2019t me grasping at straws either - I had male colleagues with less education, experience, and time in seat making more than me until I probed. I have also witnessed hiring decisions being made before interviews even began. This employer markets itself on growth potential but there is little. The recent rework of internal hiring practices has made it even more difficult. \n\nYou stay for your colleagues and the students. That\u2019s all I can say.

I've worked in higher ed for a long time and this is by far the best institution I've worked for... I can't believe how fast 8 years as flown. \r\n\r\nThe student caseloads are managable enough in size to really made an impact. There is flexibility and trust to manage my schedule and my mentoring style on my own. I've referred several people to work here and also went back to earn a Masters from WGU. I think our model works, I believe in the mission, and I do feel like as a University, we're putting good in to the universe and making a difference. I feel good at the end of the day for the difference we make with students and the quality of our program. I wish I would have found this institution much sooner.\r\n\r\nWorking with WGU has allowed me to move, navigate major life changes, and have my children home with me (especially during the pandemic and distance-learning) without having to leave my job. I live in an area with higher rates of unemployment and low rates of college graduation and WGU has afforded me the opportunity to remain gainfully employed and advance my educations as well.\r\n\r\nI work with some phenomenal people in my department. Honestly, almost everyone in the department is positive, \"bought in\" to the mission, supportive, and very talented.", "cons": "Pay is the number 1 con that I could report. Speaking for Mentoring, new employees now start on average $10k more than I did 8 years ago, which is an excellent win for the department. However, the few of us who have been here that long were not compensated when the new campus president came on board and there was a pay increase. I am now a \"level 2\" and it's taken me 8 years and a promotion to make what some folks on my team do after 2 years or less - it's a bit insulting. Other perks like paid gym memberships, wellness benefits, meal vouchers, etc. that SLC-office folks get in addition to salary do not apply to me because I am remote and it's not in my state.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that in-office departments have an understanding or appreciation for the faculty that works remotely and actually engages with students on the daily - little support for those of us in student facing roles. It's hard to listen in meetings when the SLC office employees pat themselves on the back for metrics such as retention, graduation, and OTP and make no mention of the Mentors and Instructors who are the only ones actually held to these KPIs. In every town hall meeting, the campus president thanks folks in Financial Aid, Enrollment, IT, etc. for things like graduation, retention, and OTP - when it's the faculty in Mentoring and Instructing who meet with the students daily and are judged on those metrics. It's a running joke among Mentors, it's like they forget we're here. Recognition for faculty and the work we do to keep it all moving and act as a student's first point in contact in ALL things would be more motivating. Mentoring is a very catch all, wearing many hats, problem solving department and non-remote employees don't seem to understand the bulk of what we do.\r\n\r\nI wish there were more opportunities for career growth. I've experienced retaliation from a Sr. Manager for applying for a different position, being accused of trying to \"abandon my program, leaving 100 students with no place to go and creating more work for my coworkers\", even after I had Manager support. In general also, positions for remote employees are few and far between. Even positions that were once remote have all moved to in-office. They talk in town halls about different things to support career growth, but in real life, it doesn't work that way. \r\n\r\nBetter paternity leave options would be great. WGU is a fairly progressive University, it was disappointing to see how little of paternal leave was covered before draining your PTO and having to spend months afterward paying back insurance premiums."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Working with WGU.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Senior Talent Acquisition Partner in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing leadership\r\nIncredible company mission.\r\nBeing part of an organization that is making a historical difference in the world of education.\r\nA great diverse non-profit environment", "cons": "Would like to see more locations through the U.S."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Nice environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Enrollment Counselor in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Feel valued as an employee and person.

They do not care about your credentials, your drive, your extra contributions, or the most ironic part your education. They will push and push you to complete your education, but there is literally no incentive given to employees that complete their education. I received my MBA through WGU and have been stonewalled every chance I get to receive a promotion or even move laterally to an entry-level job in a different department despite being horribly overqualified for the positions I\u2019m applying for. I know for a fact that I am not the only one currently in this position here at WGU. The irony is not lost on me that the place I received my Masters degree does not care that I received a Master\u2019s degree. A university does not care that I pushed myself to gain more education.\n\nThe culture here is incredibly toxic.

They'll do an automated message to this review, but they won't do anything to actually help with employees in similar situations. \n\nEmployees are blamed when students don\u2019t make deadlines, don\u2019t get admitted, or act like entitled children. The metrics used to measure performance are horribly outdated, (over a decade old), and don\u2019t make sense for the current scope of the job/ changes that have been made in the recent past.\n\nManagement actively tries to oust and remove incredibly talented people in favor of those who are unqualified and don\u2019t actually fit requirements.

Change is constant.  Policies seem inconsistent and punitive.  There is a growing culture of fear.  Always the veiled threat of being put on warning, especially if you have an opinion about anything.  Mentors do not teach, in fact new policy carries punitive response if a mentor tries to actually share course specific assistance with students.  The dis-aggregated model prohibits collaboration and completely removes the student mentor from anything that resembles academic input.  Morale is terrible, with many employees whispering to each other, but never feeling comfortable voicing real concerns for fear of retaliation and alienation from upper management.  Respected, insightful program managers of yesterday have left in droves leaving ill prepared, bullying, unqualified program managers to act as babysitters and yes people to the autocratic, unenlightened senior management staff.  The heart of WGU seems to have been beaten out of it.

For instance, student mentors can work towards becoming either course mentors,  program managers, etc..  There are many paths to other positions should you choose to advance.", "cons": "Student Mentors are evaluated on how well their students perform.  The top measure is for OTP (on time progress), did all of your students in a given month finish their term completing a minimum of 12 competency units (CUs).  This is often out of the mentors' control as students are allowed to complete only 3 CUs per term and still continue to their next term.  Especially if students are paying for the terms themselves many are content with attending \"part-time\".  Meaning they sign up for 12 to 14 CUs but only plan to complete 3 or 4 CUs.  Even students on either military of financial aid can complete less than 12 CUs.  Regardless of how much you motivate students and ensure they have access to a multitude of resources for success, many will not achieve OTP.  Another measure is retention (how many students remain enrolled), and most students do continue and graduate.  However, there are times that students need to withdraw for personal reasons, or because they have lost financial aid due to not maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP).  This has not been an issue for me but for many others student mentors it is.  Another measure if when students complete a survey about how satisfied they are with the university and the mentoring support they receive.  If students experience frustration over catalog upgrades, issues with connecting to resources, or an interaction with a course mentor, this will all count against the student mentor.  WGU's systems have improved vastly, even with all of this student's may have a bad week right prior to the survey and complete it based on that.  For instance, they may have received a 2nd email warning they need to take their mentors' call since this is their attendance.  Students become frustrated over this and write a negative review.  The mentor's interactions are a fair review, but students survey rating on the University or course mentor interaction is often beyond the mentor's control.  Since OTP is one of the most critical measure and if it falls low enough mentors will be put on a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan).  This is a warning that if OTP does not improve, mentors are at risk for losing their jobs.  Often this can be the luck of how motivated your students are or what stage in they are their degree program (students after two years  may complete fewer courses in a term, due to the fact they have reached the most challenging courses in their programs, or they have had major life events which cause them to not be as successful as they normally are).  Mentors have no control over students major life events, or whether they are satisfied with completing fewer courses in a term.  There are few repercussions for students and they may simply be burnt out.  Many WGU student mentors have been let go for low OTP, even if they were excellent mentors.  When mentors start they are given all new students who are fresh and eager to learn, thus their OTP is high.  After a year to eighteen months, mentors rarely if ever receive new students.  Instead, they will receive transfers from mentors who have been fired or re-entry students who have quit college before.  This starts an OTP downward spiral and I cannot think of any mentors who have been with WGU for 18 months or more, who have never battled low OTP.  To summarize the system of evaluation of student mentors is extremely flawed and needs to be modified.  Even if mentors manage to battle back after being placed on a PIP (for low retention or OTP) It forever shakes the mentor's confidence and their perception of the fairness of the evaluation.  In addition, if WGU ever wanted to rid themselves of a mentor who is a battling a major illness all they would need to do is ensure they transfer struggling students to that mentor.   Even though WGU can fire \"at will\" this is an easy way for them to save face, by not firing individuals because they are ill."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Culture and work life balance", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture WAS really great.\r\n\r\nPeople are nice.\r\n\r\nGood work life balance.\r\n\r\nProcess are well established.\r\n\r\nMid-level managers are great.\r\n\r\nCompany runs very well and stable.\r\n\r\nPTO , sick day, health plan are on or above average.\r\n\r\nEmployee discount on taking classes from WGU.", "cons": "The major problem is all about HR and salary.\r\n\r\nFor IT department, salary is 10%-15% below market value and training/conference budget is very low.   \r\n\r\nFrom 2018 -2019, they hired plenty VPs or C-levels, and at the same time we lost about a third to half of head counts in our team.\r\n\r\nAnd even worse, HR put a very low salary range for the opened positions,  several positions ends up opening for months to a year and could not find proper replacement.  \r\n\r\nSo does other budges and training funds.\r\n\r\nAll suggestion and communication regarding compensation issue has been totally ignored.\r\n\r\n(Not to mention, in company wise, mentors get payed even worse.)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great options for some faculty and students", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 May 2018", "job_title": "Student Mentor in Port St Lucie, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours\r\nHealth benefits\r\nSupportive org structure\r\n\r\nMy students come from a wide background.

Not a big deal, but working harder rather than smarter was typical as a response to challenges.\r\n\r\n2) If remote, you may not meet your people for the better part of a year. This slows down teambuilding and trust, which can be built in 1 on 1 meetings and team meetings - but not everyone is honest in those settings. So holding your teams accountable can be challenging. Many Mentors want to fly under the radar and not be coached or managed. In other words, the mentors want a 1 way relationship, where they ask for things or throw problems at the manager but do not reciprocate. They are \"too student focused\" to have time to discuss normal employee/management topics. \r\n\r\n3) The University was surprisingly clique-y, with unseen power structures and favoritism. In order to advance you had to pass the loyalty test first, broadcast the loyalty, make senior managers feel good about themselves, and only then you could have ideas. I had ideas first before being in the \"in\" crowd, which turned out awful. It also helped to be in Phoenix, Salt Lake City or Austin, as many of the other reviews point out. I was hired believing there would be opportunities, but it is hard to make your mark in the field.\r\n\r\n4) For its size, the university lacks infrastructure. For years it was small and using cheaper products or piloting things for free. As it has grown it is still trying to operate with Google Suite and old systems. It keeps getting new CTOs and turning them over because they are being asked to do the impossible. Most tech deployments are delayed or have to be shut down and fixed after deployment. It also lacks training infrastructure and resources, with a few dedicated trainers being taxed to the max and often turning over based on burnout. \r\n\r\n5) The University has execution problems. Because of the infrastructure (tech and functional departments) there are tremendous inefficiencies and firewalls strewn throughout. If that type of thing bothers you then it will bother you working here. For example, the Records Department will not talk to another internal employee outside of University Services. This puts Mentors in a tough situation, between the student and the resolution. \r\n\r\n6) Doublespeak - there is plenty of use of values and \"leadership principles\" talk used to justify the means of senior management. It was my experience that few were willing to discuss the real problems for fear of a mutiny. So information was controlled, to a fault.

In contrast, Bob Mendenhall (former President who now works in a different capacity) made over $800,000 in 2012. I do not have more recent figures but I am going to guess based on the success of the university that he is now approaching $1 million a year. He was the highest paid college president in Utah in 2012. Pretty shameful that the people who are enrolling students at a pretty rapid clip are just getting by but the president is rolling in money. But they are a non-profit so I guess not everybody can benefit from the success of the university. Even jobs such as mentors, which require a master's degree only start in about the low $40k range. For a university that preaches about \"changing lives\" they certainly do not put much value on the education its own employees have. That is a source of heartburn for me. \r\n\r\nSecond complaint is the never ending technical problems. Mr. Pulsipher, if you are reading, I hope you were brought in to fix the technology problems that run rampant at WGU. I cannot even begin to list all the problems with the application process (student oftentimes have to troubleshoot their computer with the help desk to even apply), the readiness assessment, the admissions decision, the telephones, admissions inbox, the list goes on and on....Nobody seems to listen or care. I am hopeful the new president, who has a technology background will fix all the problems with this ONLINE university that should be running like clockwork by now. \r\n\r\nMy third complaint is the fact that WGU, which is a non-profit is slowly turning into the next University of Phoenix. The focus has been on getting more and more students. The funny thing is WGU cannot even support them all and many times programs are capped and cannot accept anymore students but we were told as an enrollment team that we need to do a better job of converting potential student into actual students. WGU puts barriers to entry into place such as the readiness assessment, prior college experience required, pre-requisites etc....but then blames the enrollment team that we are not converting at a high enough rate. Perhaps the marketing team should look in the mirror when it comes to conversion and the demographic they are marketing to. I lost track of how many times a \"potential\" student told me they had no interest in school and did not even know they had requested information. The problem in my opinion is that the marketing team is not selective enough in how they market. People who are looking to get points for their online Star Wars games are requesting information with no intent of going to school. WGU has been lumped into a pool with all the big for-profits. WGU should be above that. \r\n\r\nMy third complaint is that management does not seem all that interested in what people have to say. They might say they do but the reality is nothing happens. They have a WGU Ideas box and they show interest in it for a few months and then it just disappears. WGU has a lot of smart people and does not take advantage of those employees' ideas. It is a waste of a lot of good thoughts and input. \r\n\r\nFinally, and one of my biggest issues is the way WGU handles processes and refuses to change any of it. For example, I was taken to task by the transcripts supervisor because I gave a student her direct e-mail. Apparently I did not follow \"protocol\". Students are not to e-mail the transcripts supervisor to her direct e-mail under any circumstances....ever! Enrollment is supposed to be student facing but the transcripts supervisor is exempt from talking to students or receiving e-mails to her directly. It is a complete joke. We could not forward students on the phone to admissions or transcript evaluators either. I will never understand that but it certainly did not create a \"WOW\" experience for many of my students. Likewise, we could not discuss the results of a student's readiness assessment. Students want to know how they did and we could not tell them. If they did not pass a section we could not tell them what it was. Just because this is how it's always been done does not make it right and Mr. Pulsipher needs to review some of these archaic policies. \r\n\r\nIf WGU truly wants to fix things they need to really start taking a vested interest in fixing them. The focus has been on nothing but getting more and more students. They have effectively put the cart before the horse and will falter if they don't figure things out. I liked a lot about WGU and hate to see them go the way UOP has the last several years but it will happen if they don't make drastic changes. This is not a forgiving industry to be in and WGU will learn this if they stick with the status quo."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Teachers College Unnamed Position", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It can be OK if you are lucky enough to work for a good manager.  \r\n\r\nFlexibility to work remotely for many jobs.", "cons": "Poor quality and consistency among middle managers.   \r\n\r\nBad behavior at upper levels goes unaddressed.\r\n\r\nWGU conspicuously coddles and praises some groups while ignoring others.  \r\n\r\nWGU has a revolving door of upper management characters looking to make their mark and then leave.

Felt the school supported its mission to help students complete their degrees, but over time as middle/senior management grew became more focused on numbers and have forgotten the individual student. Mentors are held 100% responsible for students progress or lack their of, retention, etc, and are expected to be able to change life-long behaviors in students in 15 minute weekly meetings. Management knows that a vast majority of students were those to failed/struggled at other institutions, yet they demand that they perform like the top 20% of students. The way performance indicators are calculated is never fully explained or disclosed to mentors, so checking the data to ensure its accurate is impossible. They start you off saying... take care of your students, and your numbers will take care of themselves. NOT TRUE at all. There were known strategies and approaches, but they were not shared with new mentors or pat of initial training. Horrible work/life balance - management pays no attention to office hours. They say you can set your own schedule (with 10 hours being outside of 8-5) but if you aren't available when a student wants to meet, you have to change your schedule to accommodate it.  Inconsistent expectations for documentation - some mentors barely type a sentence in their notes, while others are expected to write paragraphs for each student call.... even on the same team. Too much preferential treatment based on who you are, and whether or not you're part of the \"in\" crowd. Not a bad place to get some higher ed experience, just don't stay longer than 2-3 years.  Unless you want to manage a team of mentors, there is no room to move up or get other experiences. Additionally, there is very POOR change management. It seemed that each person in middle/upper management was trying to make a name for themselves creating a ridiculous number of initiatives, very few that resulted in anything meaningful and often took mentors time away from focusing on students. Someone needs to be in charge of change management - and to communicate it to students and faculty in a clear, consistent manner. Constant changes were always put on the shoulders of mentors to communicate and navigate students through, often when Mentors weren't even given adequate information or resources to do so. And again, taking mentor/student time away from focusing on their progress and coursework. They tell students its a self-paced program, but they need to share very clearly that there is a minimum expectation. It seems like pretty much anyone can be admitted there, their admission standards dropped as time went on."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Course Mentors", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Arts and Humanities Course Mentor in Greenville, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working from home is flexible.

Those faulty KPIs follow mentors for 6 months and are tied to promotions, raises, and even continued employment. Management sends marketing emails for third-party services designed to promote future business on behalf of mentors without the mentors' knowledge. Management states that if employees protest, they could get fired or be denied promotions. The records department has removed access to their assistance for the rest of the university and are not required to respond to requests for information (for the purpose of helping students) in a timely manner.

My team was awesome", "cons": "The management at WGU have no clue what they're doing. There is an established system. However there's little to no understanding of what contributes to a successful enrollment. The claim is to treat students like people and accommodate. However there is no accommodation for the EC if a student decides they do not want to start. \r\n\r\nThat is typically understandable however, most are told to be at or above average. Anyone with a basic understanding of averages knows that if someone is average there is always someone below and someone above. How is an EC supposed to be at or above average with consistency? Besides that the scheduling software used lists EC's alphabetically which ensures that some folks get many leads and some of us get next to nothing. That was a common complaint logged multiple times by many EC's that fell on deaf years. \r\n\r\nIf a manager has a personal vendetta against you, they will nitpick your work endlessly. The enrollment goals at WGU constantly move around without any understanding of changes to enrollment levels through the year. You\u2019re just told to perform no matter what. \r\n\r\nA great example of this is the data analytics team who provided the enrollment team with a statistics regarding successful students at WGU. One of their statistics displayed that students who enrolled in 30 days or less had a much higher rate of acceleration and graduation. Now this is certainly the case when one has a driven student who is interested in enrolling and graduating as soon as possible. Those students typically tend to have their transcripts, and financial aid complete by the time an initial call is even conducted. Now given those facts, drive and motivation are a huge reason for these student\u2019s success. Anyone who has interacted with students who are determined understand this. The enrollment team apparently deduced that any student who enrolls in 30 days has a higher chance of success. So instead of focusing on program development and eliminating enrollment hurdles, they decide to push EC\u2019s to enroll students in 30 days or less. When a majority of our students are turned away due to a lack of prior college or certifications, how are EC\u2019s supposed to enroll students in 30 days or less. The 30 days or less push shows a worrying lack of basic reasoning while setting enrollment goals. \r\n\r\nSome programs at WGU basically disqualify students the second they apply to certain programs, which would be fine if there were ways to guide students towards making their way in. Unfortunately WGU would prefer telling students to pursue options outside of the school to then transfer back and then start which annoy's most students. We weren't allowed to advise students on which certs to choose at one point. Then they changed it recently to allow us to suggest certifications. The irony is people have been warned or worse fired for trying to advise students on which certs to take. To add insult to injury, they decide to make this standard operating procedure to advise students on certifications after certain EC\u2019s were warned about suggesting options. \r\n\r\nGetting promoted in the company depends on who you know and whether they like you. Now while that may be true at most companies, this takes it to another level. People get promoted to train EC's within months of being employed here as opposed to people who have had tenure and actually understand a full enrollment cycle. The dependence on those who are competent at WGU does not change however. You will be warned and told your performance isn't great and on the flip side you are still consulted over issues related to student enrollment. If an employee is treated as a subject matter expert on the one hand and then treated like they can't do their job on the flip side there's obviously a problem. \r\n\r\nThe mobility in the enrollment college is limited given the favoritism that occurs.  Their most recent system of leveling is a pure joke in its implementation and has failed on quite a few different levels. They initially had EC's reporting their accomplishments on paper to receive a raise and create a layered system in order for us to \"earn\" certain benefits like being able to work from home. They even require folks to be at a certain level to be eligible to apply for jobs when the irony is the people they promote to training or management, if liked, can bypass these systems. \r\n\r\nOverall it's a terribly managed place. Enrollment is low on the totem pole and are treated as such. Bad systemic issues lead to performance problems for some and biased promotion processes. Their systems ensure that competent talented individuals eventually leave while middle management spends its time maintaining the status quo. It's a cyclical system of promoting mediocrity and having to adhere to antiquated, short sighted processes rather than trying to improve the system. \r\n\r\nBottom line, if you're a logical intelligent person with the ability to examine a broken system and propose solutions to try and improve it, don't bother. Work at a place that actually values your skill. \r\n\r\nYou will work at WGU constantly questioning your own competence and eventually sanity."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great pay but department ran by an oligarchy.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Service Desk Technician in Millcreek, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is great for the difficulty of the job.", "cons": "Favoritism/Biased management.

Management will ask you to start calling old leads from years ago, in which case those people probably don't want to hear from you. Talking to people all day long, especially those that don't know how to solve their own problems can be mentally draining. Also, when deserving students are not afforded the services they are offered (like when things fall through due to employee faults), it can be really disappointing. There is also the issue of potential students treating enrollment counselors like dirt and then still managing to get on the roll. I understand this is a PR move and no one wants negative publicity, but come on.  The technology is often broken. The network is down, the phones are down, the application system is down, the student portal is down. Something is always down. I understand that technology isn't perfect, but after the 20th call from a frantic student, it gets a little old. It's also embarrassing that an online school has so many glitches in their systems. WGU is growing so fast that it's bursting at the seams and can't keep up.

When I first started working for WGU, as with many of my colleagues, I was excited about the opportunity to work from home, everyone around me seemed to genuinely love their job and the staff in the training office I was in did their best to shield us from the reality of the job the longer you are there. Everyone I interacted with generally had only been working there for a little over a year at the beginning. Once I finished training after 3 months and had an opportunity to meet some other folks, I quickly learned that there are VERY FEW employees still there after 3-4 years. \r\n\r\nYou are expected to work at least 10 hours of your work week outside of normal 8-5 time frame with the majority of them being in the evening or weekend. My Program Manager expected me to follow up with my students if they missed their weekly call until I could get them. That meant if they blew off my call I had to call, email, text, blow up their phone until they responded to me and document it. If they went inactive or withdrew it was a reflection on my performance. There were many weeks that I worked at least 60 hours a week just to try to respond within their ridiculous 4 hour response time. \r\n\r\nAs many others have indicated the way that employees are evaluated on their performance is designed to make you fail. A student mentor after 6 months is evaluated on their KPIs. The percent of students that make OTP (on time progress- do they finish their 12 credits in their 6 month term), SAP (satisfactory academic progress - do students at least complete 66.67% of their coursework) Retention - how many students am I retaining in a 6 month period, student satisfaction scores with their student mentor from a survey they send to students twice a year, and student satisfaction with the overall university. If any 3 of those are below the bottom 30% you go on a performance improvement plan. For the first year and a half you perform well because your students are doing well, but the longer you are at the university the harder it is to impact your KPIs to move up. Students are struggling with classes you have absolutely no control of as far as content or the competency of the \"Course Mentor\" that is supposed to be supporting them. You are told to push them to the Course Mentor and the Course Mentor will not respond, give a canned email response, or completely blow off the appt all together so that you are left making up some excuse and working overtime to get the student the help they need in a subject you may or may not have any experience in. \r\n\r\nMy Program Manager's response was just do your best and it won't matter - the numbers will increase. If you're doing everything for your student the numbers will be high. That is not the case. While I believe that a Student Mentor can directly impact the student and help him or her be successful, it is up to the student to choose to want to succeed. We were told that we needed to call them more, conference on Course Mentors on the phone with them, all the while even though we were documenting our efforts, it makes no difference at the end of the day. The longer your students are there the lower your KPIs are going to be. Classes get harder, life happens, and you have little impact over how a person chooses to spend their time or motivation. \r\n\r\nWe were always encouraged to come up with \"new ideas\" and had these brainstorming sessions where the administration would come in and change policy on a dime. It came very apparent that if you brought attention to a flaw in an idea or policy that you would be labeled as a trouble maker or someone who was very negative and management would turn against you. For instance, they want to tell you that they \"train you\" on how KPIs are calculated, but they really don't. You ask questions and you are told not to worry about it - as long as you do a good job you will be fine. You try to calculate them yourself and have questions about errors in reporting and are shut down with threats of backlash and unemployment. There is nothing transparent about this process that every Student Mentor is evaluated on. Who is responsible to make sure there is no errors in reporting? Especially when it is brought up and immediately shut down? Every Student Mentor and Course Mentor cannot fathom why WGU still evaluates staff on the existing KPIs, however, it still continues. It is still used to keep staff in fear of being written up or put on a performance improvement plan. \r\n\r\nThere are no opportunities for professional development. They tell you there are, but in the IT college unless you want to go for a certification or read a book you pretty much are told no. I am a professional with a Master's Degree and feel that I did not advance my career by being in this roll. Call it what you want, but it's a call center. Students are not held accountable for their behavior by you or your Program Manager. They know that they don't have to answer your calls all the time, they don't have to do much of anything you say, and they can talk to you however they wish and generally nothing will happen. You can involve your manager, but there is not much that will be done about it. \r\n\r\nIf a student calls Student Services and complains, it's immediately put into your record. The student talks to your Program Manager and most likely will get a mentor change. Your manager tells you that it doesn't matter, but if you ever go on a pip they will use it against you. \r\n\r\nWGU is designed to be a very flat organization with very little upward mobility. There are a large number of entry level Student Mentor Positions and very few Program Manager positions. From there you have one Senior Program Manager in a college and then the Director of Mentoring. Unless you can completely switch departments there is not a lot of growth."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "WGU", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provides a flexible remote working environment which allows for community activities.

Working as a course mentor at WGU is the intellectual equivalent of manual labor; you will do the same thing day in and day out, you will be nit-picked no matter how hard you work, and you will be criticized no matter how good your numbers are.  \"Leadership\" at WGU is little more than accentuating the negative and overlooking good work in favor of minor (and sometime imaginary) shortcomings.  Managers also definitely play favorites.  I was treated more or less fairly, so I can't complain here personally very much, but I saw other team members' who politely spoke up about problems who were targeted with an eye toward getting them to quit.  WGU employees are fed a steady diet of negativity and are expected to be positive and helpful with students.  For the most part, I think we accomplished this.  I know that I would try to take a breath before calling a student, remind myself that I was an educator first and foremost, and strive to be positive and helpful with the student on the phone.  Management's constantly critical approach made this quite difficult, however.  \r\n\r\nUpward mobility is limited to careerists who climb over their \"team\" mates.  It is a bucket of crabs, in which courtesy and respect for others is actively discouraged, as only those who aggressively promote themselves and curry favor with management are promoted.\r\n\r\nDo not work here unless you literally have no other options; even then, start with a plan to get out as soon as you can and do NOT speak your mind until you have something else lined up.

Happy and positive culture is pursued and expected.", "cons": "The tasks are very monotonous. Lots of coworkers are getting laryngitis from leaving tons of voicemails every day. Metrics are tied around talk-time, dials, and various stages towards conversion. The expectation is that you have to always be on the phone chatting up a lead and pushing a very niche program that the school offers. Stats are shared publicly with the entire department. You have to have your phone plugged in at all times for this job and cannot step away from your desk without indicated that you're either not logged in, taking a break, or on lunch. Your phone will ring on the hunt line and if you do not pick up that is a ding on your record. Oftentimes you will be required to help students who are not your own or your specialty. Take too long on a break, or have a slow day when few calls are coming in and you will be called out on it during your weekly coaching. Goals are not often achievable unless you steal leads from other people or have a very salesy attitude. Whether or not your leads convert depends on a lot of factors outside of your control and on a bad month you will be blamed for the outcome.\r\n\r\nThere is very little communication between departments. Enrollment counselors are expected to be the phone contact between every department for the student, miscommunications are very common. Students will receive confusing, inaccurate and pushy emails from marketing and enrollment counselors are expected to clean up after the mess. Sometimes the customers can be very abusive or manipulative and management will always be on their side.\r\n\r\nPrepare to have every aspect of your workday audited and scrutinized. Calls are recorded and you will be forced to be self-critical from the coaching form. Even if you hit every requirement on a coached call you will be nitpicked on something nonsensical. They want you to dial out often, while keeping long, drawn-out conversations on the phone, while staying on-task, while emails and other calls are coming in, while pushing every lead (whether fit/unfit) through the admissions steps, even if they can't afford to go to school or have a few basic questions. All of this while keeping a very huge smile on your face. Customer service is a very large part of this job and the expectation is to give a WOW experience to every point of contact, even if the school doesn't offer what they want you will be required to do legwork for each prospect and will be called out on not spending your time properly. Management is very contradictory and hypocritical in this regard. The same momentum and results during a busy month are expected every month during the year, there is no break and there will always be a new aspect of the job to learn without replacing an older process. Expect a 60-hour job compressed into a 40-hour workweek with lower pay than a high-school educated call center.\r\n\r\nYou will get PTO but using it will be very difficult depending on who your manager is. Sick days raise suspicion and vacation days are granted based off of what the team's needs are. If you're working the required late night or Saturday and need to take it off prepare to beg every member of your team to let you trade. Overtime is rarely approved. Scheduling is very strict and your days will either be packed or stagnant depending on how bad the turnover is.\r\n\r\nWGU is growing too fast, it's noticeable with how much harder each individual has to work but compensation does not reflect that. Depending on the time of year your tasks will inflate with no increase in pay. WGU is a non-profit for the tax benefits only, it operates as a for-profit in terms of pushing every lead through the clearing stage. It's management's job to make sure that workers are happy enough to want to stay here; yet due to turnover during a busy time of year our department heads had a meeting to forbid promotion or transferring from within enrollment, all while patting themselves on the back for a job well done.\r\n\r\nThere is no upward mobility here, any expansion is horizontal to maintain the same call-center business model, with a few senior elites in management or QA positions. You have to be in the right clique while maintaining a yes-man attitude if you want to shine with anybody. The nature of this job has bred a very toxic environment within the last 2 years and has led to a lot of tattling and backstabbing between coworkers.

Then a survey goes out to every student you enroll asking if the enrollment counselor was timely in their calls. What kind of backwards thinking is this? You are frequently monitored, or shall I say nitpicked, by quality control where you must complete a standard self evaluation on a list of items they deem necessary on every call. They don't take into account the flow of the call or if you are running out of time because you need take your next appointment.  The self evaluation has no flexibility.  Even though the company is non profit, the presidents make over $800,000 a year while they pay their enrollment counselors not even a living wage. I have friends with GED's that get paid more doing call center work then enrollment counselors at WGU where it is required to have at least a bachelors degree. You are afraid to speak up on a concern because you will be labeled as a trouble maker and will be soon out the door. I made this company over $100,000 a month with enrollments and tuition fees and I was paid a wage that wouldn't even allow me to keep groceries in the house.
