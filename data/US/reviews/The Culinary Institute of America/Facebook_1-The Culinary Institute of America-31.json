The orientation was painful for the welcome team and orientation leaders because of their poor management. The CIA required students to move out of summer so they could clean and remodel the dorm. However, the dorms weren't clean and fixed at all, all the money went to making the campus look pretty so that when new students came, their parents could be impressed. When new students move in, their bunk bed is broken or without ladders. Water fountains at the dorm are broken for at least 2 semesters, and they still haven't been fixed yet so people need to get water from the egg to refill or somewhere else to buy them. The CIA spent a lot of money creating new school logos, changing uniforms, making the campus look nice, and building their hotels. The outside looks fabulous, but the inside is rotten. The CIA is short-staffed (chefs, professors) yet takes more students than usual. The CulSci program is a good example because they only have four instructors. They condense the program, so there is much information in one class. It is confusing when they expect you to know the things that weren't taught to you before. Hard for one instructor to manage 20+ students in a small lab. One chef instructor has been teaching for 30 years and no longer has enthusiasm for teaching. They don't care about how the students can learn better. It's none of their business and it's never their fault the student didn't understand them. The CIA's kitchen classes are getting easier because they want students to move on to bachelor's degrees. Yet, their academic classes are not strong because it is just a culinary school, and again they are not hiring enough instructors. Students are diverse, but the faculties are not. If you have any incidents or things to report, you will find out they run very bureaucratically, and they never keep you in the loop. They charge students a lot -- they get wholesale price or sponsored but they charge 28 points (dollars) for the case of 12 water bottles and 10 points for 10 cans of sparkling water?"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Avoid", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Managing Director in Napa, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None that I can think of", "cons": "There are quite a few"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Do not accept a position at the Culinary Institute of America", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Hyde Park, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful landscape and buildings to work in and around.", "cons": "Too many, you will be treated poorly by senior staff since that is the atmosphere."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "School", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Hyde Park, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Chefs are nice and school work isn't that stressful", "cons": "Needs better roommate assignment system"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Admissions", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Admissions Representative in San Antonio, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great food.
