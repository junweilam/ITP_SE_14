There is really not many pro's at all about this place other than that. It's pretty sad how an organization that claims to stand for something positive runs its operations like straight garbage. Management treats their employees with no consideration or respect. What's more sad that the individuals that run things are criminal against their own kind. Everyman for himself! No matter how well you perform, none of that matters. Management sleeps with who ever is willing to do so in exchange for ammunity, or to move up the ladder.

The union is a joke with the delegates themselves blocking growth and promotions. \r\nLet's start with management. Staff is under the worst pressure to make numbers. Blood drives and donor centers are over booked and understaffed and then expected to meet some ridiculous goal. Team leaders have gone as far as convieniently forgetting or just flat out refusing to give lunch or 15 min breaks when staff have been running around all day. Management is also way too involved in petty gossip and knowing staffs personal business for what ever reason. Promotions are reserved for management favorites, family members or childhood friends  who have no idea what they are doing. Don't even think that hard work and going above and beyond the call of duty is going to get you anywhere because it's not. It will only leave you frustrated and abused.  Let's talk about getting days off. By law you are  supposed to have 2 consecutive days off to relax and try to put what's left of your life together but not in this place they will mandate you to work on your days off even if you have already workers 36 days in a row and call it operational needs. Personal/ vacation days are hard to comne by like I said try to put what's left of your life together is not going to happen. Vacations are denied and don't bother asking for a day off or to be accommodated for a doctor's appointment or a family event. Oh and dont forget to smile and give the best customer service even when donors are being rude, disrespectful, racist and sexually harassing you because once again you don't matter to management they only want the money so who cares how you are treated it's all about the money. They have a way of making you feel humiliated and worthless from the second you walk in the door. And this is management on all levels from the team leaders all the way up to the CEO who by the way is so disconnected that when ever he finds the time to pretend he cares about anything but his bottom line and walk into any blood drive no one knows who he is. \r\nNow the union. If you want to be a donor specialist which is a fancy name for phlebotomist/ medical assistant you must join the union.  There is no way around that. Now with the union comes a union contract that management completely disregards is unethical and the delegates don't even know. Any contractual promotions such as person in charge again fancy name for supervisor or training promotions for learning how to use different equipment goes by seniority. Now how management gets around some people is by looking at attendances and errors and customer complaints to not give you the promotion and when that's done and mangment had no other choices and picks who ever is next that's when the union steps in and grieves the promotion because their friends where passed over. Now this process stops the promotion temporarily which gives management a second chance to find something on the current candidate so now they won't get promoted. Oh lowrd  don't get cought up in any thing that will get you a visit to the office because not only will the delegates just sit there and not say a word but they will walk out the door and tell everyone what happens. So enter the lions den at your own risk because either way you are screwed."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Terrible senior management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Account Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, tons of personal and sick days", "cons": "- NY region works on a favoritism basis.\r\n- If you are not on the list you will be targeted. \r\n- Director is not organized, micromanages and disrespect the teams opinion.\r\n- New ideas are only taken in consideration when originated by one of the top favorites or another department.\r\n- Departments do not work together\r\n- Director has a reputation and often brags about her strong ability of getting rid of people (either fire them or make up rules to make it impossible to stay)\r\n- No opportunity of growth"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "A challenging work environment both politically and competitively", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-The mission of supplying blood to the community is important and gratifying.\r\n-The salary and benefits are decent.\r\n-Being able to work with some very intelligent people", "cons": "-The internal politics are challenging for an outsider\r\n-A small group of people make all the decisions and not always in the best interest of the organization in my opinion"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bad management, dysfunctional enviroment, dissatisfied employees and overall a horrible place to work.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Apr 2011", "job_title": "Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are great, 5 weeks vacation plus holidays and sick time.
