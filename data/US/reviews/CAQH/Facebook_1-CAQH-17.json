Soon I realized that the company has a great work culture with a positive and vibrant environment. The leadership has great attitude with plenty of positivity and enthusiasm. The senior executives set the right stage and strategic direction to the company. The mistakes are treated as great opportunities for the company to succeed not allowing the blame culture to flourish.  This is where the right attitude makes a real impact on the culture.\r\n\r\nAs a Senior Business Analyst, I have the opportunity to do what I always wanted with proper accountability. The work is very creative and at the same time challenging.  People collaborate and help each other to succeed. The work is flexible and managers are very cooperative. The compensation and benefits are great! \r\nThe key to real success is an ability to adapt to changing environment.

I have worked in several companies that experienced very rapid growth and change.  It can be challenging to incorporate new employees, new ideas, new methods, etc.  Employees with longer tenure may often have difficulty adapting to changes and it may take newer employees a while to adapt to the existing culture and fit in.  The best companies try to take the best of the old and new and position an organization to handle rapid growth and change.  In my opinion, the pros greatly outweigh the cons.  I am able to speak with my manager about anything at any time.  During these periods of change, open, honest communication is the key.  My advice to everyone is to address the issues head-on in a constructive way.  Speak with your manager.  If we can't communicate directly, it's impossible to move forward.
