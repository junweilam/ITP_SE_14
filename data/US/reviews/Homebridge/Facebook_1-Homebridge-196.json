It is by far the most RIDICULOUS and frustrating payroll method I have ever encountered! It is so archaic. Whoever presented the method to the IHSS Consortium should be fired! First, they require a manual submission of one's time sheet every 2 weeks that needs to be \"mailed\" all the up to Chico, CA, which takes about 2 to 3 days. Then the worst part, the \"processing\"  Timesheets are processed by a crew of employees that claim they process them in a timely manner. Please note the words, \"they\" and \"claim\". I would not use \"timely\" to describe the duration of their process. After the processing, the check gets cut, placed back into the Pony Express and you wait another 2 to 3 days to get it. All in all, you receive your checks a week (I've waited up to 2 weeks!) to get your check in hand. Most companies are very diligent about making sure their employees are paid on a specific date, not here. You get paid whenever you do. There's no guarantee, so financial budgeting is not an option. Direct Deposit is offered, but after you submit the request, it will take a little over a month to get it enacted. As with everything regarding the payroll method, why the delay? Your guess is as good as mine. lol. I don't understand why this agency doesn't modernize and set up an ONLINE payroll system? It would be 100% more time efficient, \"eco-friendly\" in doing away with the paper timesheets (as well as the Pony Express!) and cost-effective. Why outsource a crew all the up in Chico, CA.?
