Working hard and doing a good job was not enough to merit advancement.  Mind you, I didn't strive for advancement, so my opinion is based on observation and speaking with other employees.  It's a big topic of conversation there.\r\nSalary was not a living wage.   It would greatly benefit Ochsner to invest in their employees.  Many hourly employees lacked motivation and had decreased productivity due to low wages and perceived lack of opportunity for advancement.  Must be self motivated to consistently perform at peak level.   Very small awards were given to employees recognized for best performance of the quarter, etc. A company the size of Ochsner should award more, perhaps paid days off so as not to incur actual costs.\r\nThe e-mails sent from CEO seemed like it was just talk, not that he actually believed it.  It's easy to put out some talking points, but unless they're honest and acted upon, it's just repetitive words.  CEO and all upper management should take time to visit the front lines, much valuable insight and feedback could be gained while interacting with the hourly employees.  Skip the Power of One presentations and use that time to interact with front line employees.  Empower employees at all levels.  I think you'll be surprised how they will meet and exceed your expectations.  \r\nOchsner is a good place to gain experience and training that can be leveraged to seek better employment.  I believe my employment at Ochsner gave me an edge when seeking new employment.  Potential employers seemed to value and possibly respect my association with Ochsner.  Good for resume.  \r\nBottom Line:  If you can live on what they pay you, it's a good place to get your feet wet. Be assertive in asking for what you want from your supervisors.

Ochsner continues to add responsibilities to the nursing staff - most recently, the PCTs no longer do vitals or accuchecks so nurses now have to do that on top of managing patient loads that are at times unsafe. When the census is low, nurses get floated (without the option to refuse) to units they are untrained and unqualified for, and apparently now if you get called off, you will not be allowed to take vacation time to cover it. The hospital apparently dumps most of its budget into marketing and buying new locations instead of paying its staff a living wage and maintaining staffing levels at an appropriate level to ensure patient safety.I worried about losing my license due to the working conditions at main campus, and so did many of the nurses I worked with. In some departments, management has resorted to paying hiring bonuses to new grads in exchange for 2 year contracts - yet there is no retention bonus offered for RNs who stay in their job.  Bottom line, Ochsner is run like a for-profit corporation, not a world-class hospital.  They abuse their nurses, management is indifferent, and patients will eventually pay the price. With two new hospitals opening shortly, Ochsner needs to figure out how to retain its experienced staff before they all leave for the better pay and working conditions offered by the competition."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Employment at Ochsner was a disappointment.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Information Services in New Orleans, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Power of One is encouraging. \r\nSurgeons preform leading surgeries.", "cons": "No room for career development inside departments.

Unclear expectations and scheduling. So, to be clear FOR them: You DO work EVERY OTHER WEEKEND, BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, NOT just one of the days. The therapy position is HOURLY, NOT SALARY. You will be offered a yearly figure and they quickly break it down for you to hourly. You clock-in and clock-out upon arrival and departure and there is a half hour of UNPAID time allocation for lunch each day. The pay is signifcantly less than the starting pay listed on the APTA/AOTA websites. And don't worry, even though you are working every other weekend, you get a minimal increase in your hourly pay (< $4), it is in NO WAY closer to time and a half. Also, whether you plan your schedule to leave at 4 or 4:30, you will HAVE until 5 pm at least 1x per month to cover necessary patients.  You will be told that there will be an inital period of orientation and then after about a week you will see patients... also NOT true, you will be expected to pickup patients and start a caseload by the third day in the hospital and you will be expected to carry a FULL caseload after a week and a half. This may not be trouble for all, but just a warning for new graduates.  Also, on weekends, expect to work in an area of the hospital that you have never been oriented to, this is where having awesome co-workers come in handy because they are consistently willing to help, but management doesn't play a role AT ALL. Another thing to pay attention to is the \"flex day\" you have off when you have to work the next weekend. They say they offer flexibility and try to accomodate those that work every other weekend. This is NOT true, you do NOT get to pick your flex days. In fact, you can count on NEVER having two days off in a row when you work a weekday (i.e. work Mon, Tues, Wed, have off  Thursday, work Friday, Saturday Sunday, have off Monday and then work Tues-Fri and then have that weekend off and then repeat.)"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Decent  Money,  Horrible management and Morals.
