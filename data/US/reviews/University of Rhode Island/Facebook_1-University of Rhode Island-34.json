Going above and beyond is rewarded, though!\r\n\r\nStaffs are generally well-balanced and allow you to make friendships and work with people that you normally may not get the chance to. I learned a lot. Supervisors in my experience were great--but leadership styles were incredibly varied. One on one meetings with supervisors were common (I believe required) and they were a great opportunity to improve communication and get help or flexibility if you needed it.\r\n\r\nThe schedule is for the most part flexible. Other RAs will generally be happy to switch on calls or office hours with you. Schedules- and on calls- can certainly get crazy though. You will get war stories- funny, terrible, sweet, or some combination.
