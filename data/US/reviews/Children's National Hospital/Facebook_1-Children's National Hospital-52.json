My first job as a new grad was on the respiratory care floor (which merged with medical care and doesn't exist anymore) and it was a great place to start, learn/practice new skills, get mentoring, etc.  Medical care was crazy and management seemed very much removed from the floor nurses despite being in an office on the unit.  They also seemed to only talk to floor RNs when disciplinary action needed to be taken and never for praise or anything positive.  GI phone triage wasn't too bad, but the attendings were fairly unappreciative of the triage nurses despite how much we helped field all of their patients' calls.  Child psych had great management but was a pretty chaotic environment, although I imagine it's probably the same in any child psych unit at any hospital.", "cons": "1.

Delegating to most techs on medical care seemed pointless sometimes because the RN ended up doing half of what was delegated due to the tech not doing it and not reporting to the nurse that it hadn't been done until the nurse checked up on the tech later in the shift and found that there were many uncompleted tasks.\r\n4. There are many amazing, hard-working, talented RNs all over the hospital, but of course there are lazy ones too who don't help their peers even when asked for help, always seem to be in the break room when other nursing are busting their butts for 12 hours straight.

When you ask for information from somebody within the department, the first question that is asked is, \"Why do you need it?\" People outside of the department will request the same information from many different analysts because they do not trust that they will receive accurate data.  There is currently a push to be \"employer of choice,\" but management has not explained what it feels makes an employer an employer of choice.\r\n\r\nThe skill sets of analysts are not fully leveraged or appreciated. Claims are made that we \"are paid to think,\" but analysts are just expected to run reports, not analyze or interpret the results.\r\n\r\nA program has been unveiled to recognize the performance of employees on the spot, but managers are hesitant to recognize staff. The bonus is not cash, but rather points to use on goods on a dedicated web site.  One on the spot bonus is sufficient to buy a pack of socks or an old VHS tape, nothing of significance.  You need about 4 of these bonuses to buy a video game or a dress shirt.\r\n\r\nA lot of managerial behavior is driven by incentive payments. There will not be money available to attend training or conferences because a large portion of director bonuses are based on their ability to stay under budget. Pay raises have been limited for the support staff for several years and have not kept up with the rise in the cost of living.  Although managers have not received any pay raises due to \"the economy,\" incentive payments for the managers have continued to rise and continue to be paid out despite the state of the economy."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great hospital, talented staff!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, Critical Care in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This was a great hospital to work for.
