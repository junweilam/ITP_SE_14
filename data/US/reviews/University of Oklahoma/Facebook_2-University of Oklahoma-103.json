Workplace aggression, in both covert and overt forms, is common and bullies operate within the established university rules and policies. The dynamic began (to my knowledge) when administrators (even mid-level administrators rising from ranks of the faculty) began being paid over three times that of faculty. Even 15 years ago, this was unheard of, but it is now commonplace at OU. As a result, administrators, including mid-level administrators (e.g., department chairs, assistant deans) are loyal to upper administration, no longer loyal to \"their\" faculty, and even further out-of-touch with student needs. Mid level administrators are frequently expected (by upper administration) to somehow enforce practices that are not aligned with the faculty and not in the best interest of our students and/or to student education or training. Ultimately, this pressure on mid-level admin results in their support of the staff members under their employ, over their support of faculty. Staff members don't work for the university, faculty, or students; they work for the administration. This dynamic created a breeding ground of workplace bullying. Faculty members most targeted, and most likely victimized, have been those most respected and trusted by students, and those who are viewed by students (and others) as capable, hard-working, and respected. Aggressive tactics I have witnessed first-hand include verbal and nonverbal aggression in public settings (e.g., at all types of meetings), and regular occurrences of manipulative and underhanded tactics of psychological abuse and humiliation. Faculty members who do well at the University of Oklahoma are those who pursue their own best interests, those who use difficult situations to leverage more resources for themselves, and those continually-honed impression management abilities far exceed their ability to actually engage in effective teaching and meaningful research with students."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Student Library Assistant in Norman, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly environment with an opportunity to polish customer service and administrative experience", "cons": "None.
