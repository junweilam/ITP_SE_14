I had a genuinely terrible experience working here. From the awful nurse who \"precepted\" me to the verbally abusive clinical manager, to the $32/hr they paid me in 2018, it was an awful experience. I now know why they require you to sign a 2-year contract (which 5 out of 6 nurses in my orientation class broke - that's how bad it was there). They tout the fact that your hours are 8:00-4:30 Monday through Friday with no weekends or holidays, but you will actually work 7am to 7pm to get all of your documentation done. And you will not get paid a penny extra. They act like you are are paid hourly (as if you would get paid for the extra hours you are forced to work) but this is NOT TRUE. You are a salaried employee and will not get paid for any time over 40 hours a week. I could go on and on, but I would advise you not to work here if you value work-life balance or a manageable workload. Lastly, the culture is very \"corporate\". It's not at all like any other nursing job I've had. The nurses are treated like the low people on the totem pole.

As a single, full time working Mom it is super difficult to find enough time in the day to \"do it all\"! Hospice care is exhausting and Care Dimensions has always been mindful of much needed days off. Management is very reasonable and recognizes that family should always come first. Education is extensive given the sensitive nature of our field and I have never felt unsupported by my co-workers. This was truly impressive to me given that I am alone in my car, traveling to patient homes everyday. I had less support at previous jobs in acute care settings. \r\n\"Choose a job you love and you will never work a day in your life.\" Confucius\r\nI cannot say enough about Care Dimensions, from the top down this company whole-heartedly strives to take care of both patients and employees.", "cons": "I would say the cons are not really concerning to me as the pros vastly outweigh them in comparison.
