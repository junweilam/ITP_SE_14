Conservatively, I would say that at least half of Student Services staff are severely overworked and underpaid at UNC, though staff experiences will certainly vary by department. Broadly, UNC prioritizes the hiring of upper level admin, while deprioritizing the hiring of low-level staff that allow UNC to function. We have WAY MORE provosts, deans, directors, etc. than we did when I was undergrad here and much fewer full-time staff positions. Post-pandemic, UNC decided to increase admissions without hiring additional low-level staff AND in spite of existing classroom shortages (student services staff are partially responsible for finding classrooms to schedule courses and events-- this is a significant part of the job), meaning student services jobs are getting more difficult. Like most people who work in education, my most absurd responsibility is to put a band-aid on problems that are actually systemic to the University with little to no assistance or resources. \n\nAdministratively, UNC is a dumpster fire. This was true prior to the pandemic, but COVID really shined a light on a lot of their dysfunction. If you decide to take a student services job, you will definitively be impacted by their decision-making. If you're lucky enough to have a good chair and department manager, admin's negative impact on staff will be somewhat ameliorated but that's a big IF and realistically, there's only so much that individual departments can do in that respect. \n\nIf you have no choice and decide to take a student services position, keep your resume and references up-to-date so you can quickly apply for other jobs once you hit your limit.\n\nSide note: avoid a low-level job with the Registrar at all costs. I work closely with folks in that department, and they too seem to be horrendously overworked.\n\nSide note 2: Be very wary of the one-line positive reviews for UNC on this site. I find them to be highly suspicious given what I now of campus-wide staff burnout and frustration."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Working in Clinical Research @ UNC", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Research Coordinator in Chapel Hill, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- wide exposure to clinical research within a large, well-connected, heavily resources academic medical center. \r\n- great healthcare\r\n- access to university resources and tools", "cons": "- inexperienced managers\r\n- low pay\r\n- burn out\r\n- stressful\r\n- low retention"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "On", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Learning Specialist in Chapel Hill, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flagship school and the many opportunities to build relationships with students", "cons": "Little room for growth or advancement"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Computer Systems Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Computer Systems Analyst in Durham, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people in the company", "cons": "None to speak of so far"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Tech Support Technician in Chapel Hill, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The location is great and there is a sense of community and flexibility", "cons": "You are not always able to grow professionally as quickly as industry"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "It's grad school", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Dec 2021", "job_title": "PhD Student in Chapel Hill, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get paid to study and can get decent industry placements coming out.", "cons": "Not the best stipend out there.

Funding has consistently declined since 2009.  As a result it has created an environment were there are pockets or groups that fear they will be the next layoff and as a result are afraid to share knowledge to help UNC grow which as a result leads to various teams not working together to resolve issues.    The budget decline can be managed well with the right people in place but in a smaller percentage of departments poor leadership style or management results in wanting to blame a decline in services on individual employee productivity when in fact it is simply a result of declining resources. \r\n\r\n A large part of the buildings / infrastructure are in disrepair / poor upkeep due to lack of funding and mismanagement (there are instances of air conditioning and heating running in older buildings at the same time) while new buildings are constantly being built.  Parking is a disaster due to lack of planning (typically they love building new buildings but down't plan adequate parking along with it).  Some management styles are to lead by fear when faced by shrinking budgets which results in low moral, lost productivity, and passing the buck or blame for issues so the speak by other employees as they fear being singled out as the reason an issue occurred when in most cases the issue was created by poor Departmental policy.  \r\n\r\nThe overall climate with the State budget has forced UNC to make some tough decisions that have often resulted in colleagues you become close with leaving for better opportunities.
