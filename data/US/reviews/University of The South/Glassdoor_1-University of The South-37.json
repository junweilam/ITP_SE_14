I was specifically told mine wasn't ready a week into my contract but had emails dating back to three months before my contract once I finally had access. Students were made at me for not having textbooks in the school store but this was because I wasn't added to my courses until a week or two before the semester. The university has rental housing for faculty that is walking distance campus but this doesn't outweigh the fact that it's overpriced (in large part because the university has a monopoly on the housing in the area)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in Sewanee, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, paid time off, fun work environment", "cons": "low pay, strange environment overall"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Student Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Group Fitness Instructor in Sewanee, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing boss, training provided, flexible team", "cons": "Low pay for fitness industry standards"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Food service worker", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Food Service Worker in Sewanee, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very well rounded benefits available.", "cons": "Low pay for heavy amount of work."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Intern in Sewanee, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Welcoming, super nice, great people, lax environment", "cons": "Probably some nepotism going on"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good Vibes All Around", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Access Services Assistant in Sewanee, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fairly open to communication, good humor in regards to TAS's duties, which cover many duties from my experience, always trying to keep things going in spite of the stress", "cons": "Potentially a flaw of the temp position, but moreso the immediate nature of assisting with various projects without an idea of an end goal.
