To be honest the work did get repetitive to me quick however, there are a few other positions in that department you could apply for after you gain some experience.

Everyone I've worked with in this department especially management has been very approachable, professional, and kind. Even after working here for almost 2 years I forget some procedures and people are always willing to help if you have any questions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that I think they have great benefits, some of them being partial tuition reimbursement (after you reach your 6 month mark you can be reimbursed approximately $3,000-$3,500 per year for tuition however, I don't remember the exact number), a free employee health clinic, and profit sharing between all employees I believe it's every quarter-year. \r\n\r\nAlso, as a current student I have been interested in shadowing a few different labs. Management has been very helpful and more than willing to help me set up a time to get an overview of some other labs and spend a few hours observing which I appreciate.", "cons": "Work is repetitive and can feel mundane at times. Also, although I was always comfortable asking questions I personally wasn't completely confident that I could fully perform my job after training but to be fair it does take me awhile to get a hang of things. It took me a few months afterwards to be really comfortable with the work/procedures. I understand the amount of trainers are somewhat limited and management wants to get new employees out on the floor in sufficient time while ensuring everyone is trained in an effective and standardized manner however, I think it would help to allow trainees more individual processing time with their trainers if needed. Everything felt somewhat rushed during training and there were some very common processing procedures I had completely forgot after I was assigned a pod however, my PST was very patient with me. All things considered training was still highly informative there was just an overwhelming amount of information at first.\r\n\r\nEven though there are some negatives, all things considered it's an excellent place to work and a great company.
