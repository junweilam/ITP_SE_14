Management is horrible there is no communication, no sympathy (example you need to leave because your child is sick or you are all you will get is an OK, no I hope you guys are better soon or anything) instead you are made to feel horrible about it NO MATTER THE SITUATION example you have a death in your family, they don't care. This may not pertain to all Managers but at least half. We do have a gym on site you get a whole $5 off WOW right!!  Your vacation, holiday and sick pay is rolled all into one I think you get about 6 hrs each paycheck - I know awesome right? Also if you miss or are late 8 times you are fired, in a rolling calendar year, even if you are only late by 8 mins (which is technically 1 min as we have a 7 minute lead way) Now if your manager likes you she may let you slid on the late thing.  Oh we also have childcare on site which I think it is around 170 a week maybe more - but NO discount for you employees. We do get a 10% Culvers discount ONLY in Portage - but hey it's Culvers and the food is awesome!! Some people that would in the building are nice others are not. YOU CAN NOT SMOKE - although you walk around the hospital and other places on your 15 minute break (by the way not all departments get this) but even though you are walking even off property you cannot smoke.. well you can just don't let anyone see you because they tattle pretty quick. Also, don't be surprised if your coworker(s) do not do there job or are constantly messing up (this is pertaining to the dept. I work in  cashier, billing, reception that type of thing. Anyways you will see this proof of messing up time and time again yet you can still keep your job.. WTH right I am sure there is more but until next time. Also, you will get emails saying you did something incorrectly,  however they normally do not show you proof of your mistake, so really how will we ever learn, plus instead of just emailing you to inform you of this they have to CC everyone under the sun.  Also, there are ALOT of people here that are on a high horse and they think they are better than us lowly workers, it's pretty sad yet entertaining."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Medical-surgical and cardiac/pulmonary rehab nursing opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "24 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Portage, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small rural hospital, state of the art facilities, access to providers, primary & specialty, independent hospital/clinic, wellness center, community oriented", "cons": "Infrequent postings of other available positions (employees must be satisfied), potential pay discrepancy with larger organizations, not focused on research"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "31 Jan 2019", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Portage, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team to work with, always ready to care for the patient first.", "cons": "Negative employees, that complain about the job they are paid for and the continued negativity they stir up in the organization."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Patient Care", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "26 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Portage, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is good, flexible with schedule when needed, most staff is very friendly and caring.", "cons": "staff turn over, start too many projects at one time and don't seem to finish all the way,"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bad Environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Portage, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone seeking employment unless you like being treated poorly.
