Avoid as if it were Covid.\r\n\r\nI spent a tad over 6 years (too long) working for a program serving teens and young adults. The first year or so was OK but things went downhill after that as more and more politics/ideology was introduced. Trainings, articles/books, posters, speakers, statements by upper management.. all saturated in the kind of propaganda that is now so seemingly commonplace in society. Very unfortunate.\r\n\r\nWhat I learned is that the job was much less about providing meaningful support to clients than it was about virtue signaling. And the kinds of people you can expect to work with, at least in my experience, are either na\u00efve (at best) or Nurse Ratched types.\r\n\r\nI strongly suspect that one of my former supervisors was associated with Antifa.\r\n\r\nHere are a few interesting statements made by either my supervisor or select members of my team over the years (no disciplinary action taken):\r\n\r\n\"I hate men.\"\r\n\"White people are the devil.\"\r\n\"We're all socialists here.\"\r\n\"Individualism is white supremacy.\"\r\n\"Capitalism is patriarchy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on. Super professional stuff here. Great idea to bring to the workplace.\r\n\r\nLots of gaslighting, guilt tripping too.\r\n\r\nAll of this gleefully camouflaged by glitter, rainbows, and unicorns. Such love, such inclusion, such respect. A unicorn rubber ducky was used to award staff in my program for going 'above and beyond'. No, I'm not making this up.\r\n\r\nThe organization, as a whole, made it a point to signal their virtue over current events on a regular to placate employees and likely to maintain/secure sources of funding. They were big on bandwagoning the BLM movement at the time, probably still are even now that they've been outed as a criminal enterprise.\r\n\r\nDon't bother bringing any of this to the attention of HR. They are staffed by SJWs. They love careers in administration. At best, you will be ignored. At worst, you will be placed on a plan with intent to terminate.\r\n\r\nSo.. again.. if you consider yourself a thinking person and aren't on-board with the woke garbage in this day and age, avoid the hassle and apply elsewhere.
