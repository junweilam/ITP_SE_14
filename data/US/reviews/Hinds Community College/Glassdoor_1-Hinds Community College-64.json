They don't train, so you have to pickup what you can as they hand off work to you, usually stuff that's tedious but nothing that will add to a real skillset. If you are lucky, like me, someone will let you train under them and you may finally get some recognition. Otherwise, management does't care anything about you or your family, although they may say so to your face. The pay is the worst, for upper level IT it's disrespectful. I left there with a mountain of debt because I had to live off credit cards to pay for medical visits, living expenses, and sometimes food. Hinds is a place where you go to give up and die in your office, filling out useless paperwork or errands that are assigned to you. Don't plan on learning anything or expecting anyone to give you the time of day. If you go on an interview, ask them about \"Daily Reports\". Also, lookup \"Cache memory\" (CPU) and \"The Language of the internet\" (TCP). Those are on the list of all time stupid interview questions that many of them probably couldn't answer without looking it up, so don't feel bad if you miss some questions.
