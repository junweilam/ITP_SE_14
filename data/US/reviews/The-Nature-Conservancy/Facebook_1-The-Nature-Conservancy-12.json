What's also admirable is TNC's focus on their staff as people and their goal of having a true work-life balance at the organization. It's no wonder I have colleagues who have been here for decades.

In my chapter (state), layoffs are entirely arbitrary. The first to go are those with greater seniority because of their higher salary - I have seen many great workers, with more than 15 years, get laid off - the de facto result is that TNC discriminates against older workers, TNC's mission has changed drastically in the past few years.
