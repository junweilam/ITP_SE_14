The main aims of management seem to be to increase the salaries of management, create new and unnecessary jobs at high compensation levels and to keep doctors by paying them higher than average salaries. (Doctors also get a large portion of their college debts paid by working at SIHB.)\r\n\r\nImproving healthcare and outcomes for all SIHB patients, seniors, veterans, teens, those suffering from domestic violence? Increasing use of the clinic by the Native American community? These things are NOT on management\u2019s or the Board of Directors\u2019 radar or to-do list.\r\n \r\nThere is great inequality at SIHB between the \u201cimportant people\u201d and everyone else. Waste and misuse of federal government funds is the norm at SIHB. There is a Pulitzer Prize awaiting a reporter who really digs into SIHB\u2019s past and present and reports the truth. \r\n\r\nAs far as Thunderbird Treatment Center? It is understaffed with unqualified employees and presents real dangers for patients; its main buildings are in terrible condition. \r\n\r\nIf you are considering a job at the SIHB keep these things in mind:\r\n\r\n1.\tWhat is said in your interview is a sales pitch that you should rigorously question and challenge, especially if you\u2019re interviewed by upper management (the CEO). You will be told you will be \u201cempowered.\u201d You will not be empowered; you will be controlled and \u201cguided.\u201d Upper management acts like the SIHB is its \u201cfamily-owned\u201d business, and the Board of Directors remains silent and gives a stamp of approval to anything.\r\n\r\n2.\tYou will have almost zero power in your job to make decisions or change things for the better, no matter your title; HR is powerless -- A BAD SIGN in an organization. All decisions are made by a very few people. Upper management is especially unqualified in the recruitment area; the more important the job, the more likely a bad hire will be made. Creating unneeded upper management positions at SIHB is the norm. \r\n\r\n3.\tYou will be working at a place where the majority of workers are unhappy, scared of losing their jobs, and \u201cact out\u201d this unhappiness by fighting with each other. Employees are constantly arguing and complaining and quitting.\r\n\r\n4.\tFor the most part, you will be surrounded (even in upper management) by people who do as little work as they can get away with and who are hired for positions they are not qualified to fill. Since SIHB staff can\u2019t do their own jobs, they get assistants and/or consultants to \u201chelp\u201d them (at a high monetary cost to the SIHB). \r\n\r\n5.\tUnless you are a doctor or in upper management, you will be paid poorly compared to like jobs in Seattle.\r\n\r\n6.\tThe SIHB is shrinking (not growing) after at least 15 years of careless, unethical and greedy mismanagement by past and present \u201cleadership.\u201d Favoritism and nepotism are the norm: if you are liked (and never challenge management) you get a new title and more money; people are hired for jobs because of family connections, not ability. \r\n\r\n7.\tThe Board of Directors is distant and disconnected from SIHB operations; they don\u2019t know what funds are available or how those funds are being utilized. On Board of Directors meeting evenings, I heard board members state openly \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d\r\n\r\nI am very sad to say that if you are a patient in need or a job seeker, for your own physical and mental well-being go elsewhere for your medical care and your career."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "I used to love working here", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Passion for improving the health of urban natives, an innovative health center with a ton of potential for those of us who grew up on the rez and want to find connection in the city.", "cons": "Bad management, little respect for long time employees.
