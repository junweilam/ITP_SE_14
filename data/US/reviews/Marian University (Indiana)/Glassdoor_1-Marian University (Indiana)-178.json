We simply cannot support a graduate program in the sciences with the lack of labs and funding for research. The medical school seems to do it, but the rest of campus simply can't. And even the medical school faculty talk to us and seem to have concerns about the quality of their MS program that it is just a tuition generator and most of the students don't get the experience they would at a school with resources.

All the men in the administration are paid substantially more than the women, which can be verified through public records.  There is severe micromanagement and no support for the  core curriculum. The administration only cares about money, not about preserving the dignity of individuals. They even knocked down the convent where nuns from the founding order lived in order to build graduate student housing. That sort of behavior makes Marian a Catholic school in name only. Instead, the administration worships the almighty dollar, and yet the school is millions and millions of dollars in debt. It's very unstable. \r\n\r\nBut the worst thing is the way that the administration bullies the faculty. It treats everyone like they are expendable and uses fear to keep people in line. I wouldn't work there again if I were paid double the money. Having left, I feel like I've finally been restored to sanity."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Help Desk Analyst", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 May 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Muncie, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people i worked with were very nice and easy to get along.
