Any positive reviews were probably written by someone in administration. \r\nIf you think you are coming here to help people in need you are not. Your job is only to make contact, write a note in the crappy electronic system then move on. You are discouraged from spending too much time with clients. . A certain percentage of your time must be billable and your numbers are given to you each week and you are held accountable for them or lose your job. Who goes into Human Services to be treated like that? On the MH side meds and counseling are provided but still it's \"make contact and move on\". Intellectual Disability side is the same only worse. THE JOB IS TELEMARKETING AT BEST. \r\nWorking in the field has unreasonable expectations attached known as benchmarks. Your job is only to make your benchmark by any means necessary, which could mean nights and weekends. Fraud is rampant.\r\nManagement uses threats and intimidation to get what they think they want. Your job is always being held over your head if you don't make your numbers. There are no professional managers here. All of them are past clinicians, psychologists, social workers, doctors, etc with no training in management. Their only skills are parenting and whatever they learned from their last supervisor. \r\nCEO is worried about turnover but does not know how to do anything about it. No recognition, no incentives or reward system. No culture and nothing to work for except a below average salary. You can be assigned tasks that are not in your job description. You can be moved around at will into anything they want you to do like it or not. If you don't like it you are told you can leave. They do not want to help employees find positions that will be mutually beneficial.\r\nFront line workers are treated like low class people. Input from workers is unwelcome as managers and executives are too immature to accept that someone else may have a good idea. Managers are unwilling to learn new things, be creative or adapt. Managers are intimidated by good workers and don't want to be shown up. \r\nFavoritism (and other \"isms\") are rampant. People are hired based on anything except qualifications. Intelligence is not appreciated here. Just quietly do your job, your ideas are not welcome because, again, managers are too immature to consider they may need to grow.\r\nThe quality of your work does not matter. If all of your clients call in to support you, you will never be told or recognized even if you make your numbers. Benchmark is all that matters. \r\nThere is also very limited upward mobility. Managers rarely leave and when they do they will groom their favorite or execs will look outside to fill the position.\r\nLeaders here are basically bullies. And many managers here are dinosaurs.
