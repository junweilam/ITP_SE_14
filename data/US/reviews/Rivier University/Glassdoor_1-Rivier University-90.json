Sister Paula works hard to protect these students at any expense - will allow them to treat staff with disrespect, foul language, and attitude that would not be tolerated from other students. \r\n\r\n2. Pay is low. Take whatever you're thinking and subtract, subtract, subtract. \r\n\r\n3. No chance for advancement. Upper management has been there for 20+ years. No new opportunities. \r\n\r\n4. For a work environment of mainly middle aged people it sure feels a lot like high school. Gossip, backstabbing, slander, etc. If you can stay out of it you will do fine. \r\n\r\n5.

Lots of seemingly random policy changes with little to no explanation. \r\n\r\nTL;DR - not a bad place to get your feet wet, but not anywhere you want to get comfortable.
