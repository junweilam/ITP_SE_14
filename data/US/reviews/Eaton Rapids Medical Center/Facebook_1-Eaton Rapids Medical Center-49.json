They do not listen to the employees well enough, and will gaslight you if you try to stick up for yourself. Upper management should not be trusted, the whole breaking down silos is just talk. There's not much improvement going forward with administration in the hospital. You will have to walk around on eggshells to work for Eaton Rapids Medical Center, and no room for growth within the company. Document every interaction you have. They like to use threatening behaviors to get you to fall in line. Also, it is a rural hospital the culture is very rural and not LGBTQ friendly."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Okay place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Denials Management Specialist in Eaton Rapids, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great health insurance, best places to work committee, many other great benefits at a low cost.", "cons": "A very small health system"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Overall great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Manager in Eaton Rapids, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smaller atmosphere that has a great culture for staff.
