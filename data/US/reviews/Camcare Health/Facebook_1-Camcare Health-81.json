The working hours are 8:00am to 4:30 pm and lunch(you do not get paid for lunch) is one hour no paid  breaks. Problem is that they force you to work through lunch and after closing time with no pay for either (.In other words you are not compensated for overtime) They will tell you that you get free health care and you should be happy with that. You have no time to clean up the opertory between patients,and little time to do your instruments, and they allways run out of supplies meaning mask, gloves, intruments and dental materials. Some of the dental assistants work very hard ,while others just do nothing and sit on there butts all day and talk on the phone at the front desk, and when you ask them for help they will tell you no. It is a hostile working enviorment ( the patients are the worst too!!) and Camcare has a high turnover in employment ."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Leaves you wanting more", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Facilities in Camden, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Majority great people to work with.", "cons": "Minority lack people skills, management skills."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "an awesome learning experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Nov 2011", "job_title": " in Camden, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "no out of pocket healthcare cost", "cons": "small company no room for advancement"}], []]
