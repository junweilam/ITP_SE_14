Because of this, United Regional has money to invest in expansion, renovation, and hiring and retaining quality workers. The mission statement (divided into two statements) is: PASSION- to provide excellence in healthcare to the communities we serve. PURPOSE-to make a positive difference in the lives of others. These are more than catchy slogans designed to impress the public. The CEO and Management of the hospital actively work toward these goals and over the last 15 years or so, have made some impressive changes by implementing nationally recognized systems specifically designed to bring patient care to the highest standards possible. They actively engage employees by having them set goals within their own department to reach these standards and provide bonuses yearly based on achievement of those goals. The bonuses go to the employees, not the management. United Regional also provides feedback in \"Employee Forums\" four times a year  where the CEO speaks to every employee about a wide range of hospital issues from \"State of the Union\" to tracking bonus status to gossip. They also put out a monthly magazine and weekly email \"What's going on\" letters in addition to having an active employee website that provides information, free education opportunities and tuition reimbursement information. There are celebration events at Christmas, during Hospital Week, during Nurses Week as well as an annual All Employee Event where the entire staff of the hospital gets bused offsite to see a play (usually involving senior management dress in hilarious outfits and a really good speaker). The hospital also regularly compares employee earnings to hospitals of similar size and makeup to ensure that they are competitive with wages and retain employees. They give across the board pay increases if they find they are falling behind in an area. The benefits are good and the health insurance has remained remarkably stable despite nationwide increases in cost to the employee in most companies.
