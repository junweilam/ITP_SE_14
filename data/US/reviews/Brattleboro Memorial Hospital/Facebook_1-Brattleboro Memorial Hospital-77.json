He decided to get rid of the Walk-in clinic housed on the campus that is independent from the hospital, runs entirely on donations, fundraisers and volunteers.  Local doctors, nurses and dentists who volunteer their time and provide ESSENTIAL care to people in the community who may not have insurance or cannot pay for the ridiculous medical costs we have today.
