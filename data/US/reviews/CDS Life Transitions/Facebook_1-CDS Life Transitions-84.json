When I first read other Glassdoor reviews about CDS Life Transitions prior to my employment, I wrote off the negativity as sour grapes and assumed the author was mistaken. \u2028I WAS WRONG.\u2028\u2028\r\nNepotism is rampant, and it is absolutely true that the CEO will look after the careers of his two children over other employees and the good of the company. Human Resources turns a blind eye to the complaints received about his daughter and son. His daughter really does watch a lot of TV at work, I was surprised to learn that was true.\u2028\u2028\r\nAnother review mentioned that the CEO is heartless. This is also true, and it is well known in the nonprofit community that he is a bully. He insults and berates his staff. Breaks contracts on a whim, and is genuinely unpleasant. You really will regret working close with him. \u2028\r\nFor a company that\u2019s purpose is to serve vulnerable people they certainly don\u2019t live up to that mission.
