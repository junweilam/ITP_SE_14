I moved to the area for other reasons, and applied at GVMC.  I accepted the position when it was offered to me, even though it was a 65% pay cut for from my previous facility.  Pay is understandable, GVMC is a small 120 bed hospital, so I expected the pay cut, just not that severe.\r\nIf you work in the healthcare field doing direct patient care, and are NOT a physician, you may find this facility tedious and absurd if you have worked at other facilities who have advanced past 1983 medical practices.  Physicians are still looked upon here as \"gods\" who are not to be questioned, regardless of their abilities/knowledge base.  After observing several physicians ordering non indicated medications and other treatment modalities, I began to become more verbal about it, and was told other healthcare workers are not to question physicians. \r\n The emergency room physician and staff in general are probably the worst.  The physicians don't see patients in the emergency room for roughly the first 20-25 minutes that they get an actual  room.  The nurses have a check list of generic orders they can just check off to do and the physician later signs the orders.  Many of these orders are non indicated as well.  Unnecessary labs, ekg's, breathing treatments, all to patients who have no true indication for them, and are either done because the staff (physicians included) are not competent in their diagnosing skills and have to order an enormous battery of tests to diagnosis, OR it is simply done to bill health insurance/medicare/medicaid and increase the facilities revenue.  \r\nMany of the physicians that work at this hospital are older, and do not seem to be aware that advances have been made in medicine, as they still seem to practice as if it is 1983.  I never met one physician who was open or receptive to discussion/suggestions/or input about patient care, no matter how outdated their practices and treatments were.\r\nThe hospital has a terrible reputation amongst the locals in the area, I was told by many many people in the community that the nickname for Greenbrier Valley Medical Center was \"Death Valley\", I'm not sure I would go to that extreme.  The nearest hospital is over an hour away besides GVMC, and unless I would die within 10 minutes, I would take the chance to drive to another facility for healthcare.  \r\nI can honestly say their is nothing positive about this facility as a whole, or even any department in general."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not worth it", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Phlebotomist in Ronceverte, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to get experience straight out of school.
