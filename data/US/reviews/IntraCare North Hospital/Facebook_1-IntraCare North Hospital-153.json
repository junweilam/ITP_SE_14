During those 8 years I realized if you invest in them, they'll invest in you. IntraCare is a learning hospital where education is valued and all feedback is important. They provide great customer service and patient care! The team at ICN are vigilant and also treat everyone with courtesy, dignity and hope. This is a place that live their mission. They walk the walk and talk the talk. ICN is often in demand due to patients being so much better when they get out. I know this by personal experience when my loved one had a psychotic break and was sent to ICN. They stabilized him, provided educational tools and explained why these things are important. Tools in his tool kit to pull out when needed. He's 5 years being med compliant and no use of substances. Thank you ICN for giving me my brother back and a better quality of life", "cons": "Often can be at capacity due to high demand"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Pay bare minimum because they only hire people with provisional license", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Therapist in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You are able to get experience", "cons": "They make it clear that there is no long-term investment in you"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Stress", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are great people that worked here", "cons": "Unsafe patient ratios.
