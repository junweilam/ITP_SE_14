My boss was condescending, insensitive, and a micromanager who wouldn't let you do your job. not to mention that they didn't even know how to do many aspects of the job. My POC coworkers and I faced daily microagressions in this space. If you work here, be prepared to be underpaid, taken advantage of, and gaslit. Overall, this clinic is run by white people who pretend that they care about their POC workers and patients but are more interested in their own status within the community and clinic. There is a reason for the high turnover rate they experience."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Learned a llot", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Health Educator in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You help people that need it.", "cons": "I would rather not comment."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Volunteer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice staff and working environment.", "cons": "Nothing bad to add to my experience."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management needs to do better", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Health Educator in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Helping the Patients and Insurance", "cons": "Management is the worst, they do not listen to what employees have to say about their bosses who can be verbally abusive"}], []]
