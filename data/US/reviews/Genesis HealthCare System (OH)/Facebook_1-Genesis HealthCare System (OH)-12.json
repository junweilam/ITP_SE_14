Of course you must use their Hospital and doctors. The medical staff is sub par, but treated as royalty. The Hospital is old, dirty and the equipment is very outdated. They time off policy is a joke. They don't even offer bereavement, you have to use your vacation. You can't even use the time off policy because they are so understaffed.You are constantly expected to stay many hours over your shift with no extra compensation. I do have a family and struggle to find a sitter who will watch my children 16 hours a day. Can't afford an in home nanny. I don't work in management.  \r\nThere is little communication from management .Policies are interpreted at the discretion of each department manager always to their benefit. Don't ever question a doctor, even if the outcome could be bad for the patient you will be fired. Employees are to bow down to every physcian because they bring in revenue. It's all about the mighty dollar. The new CEO has cut benefits and raises so he can make a name for himself by building a new hospital. Management knows they don't have to treat you fairly because there are many nursing schools in the area, and plenty of new grads to take your job if you quit or get fired. The morale is so low and everyone is constantly complaining. With  the tight job market they have no choice. No compassion for employees or patients. Management doesn't know how to manage finances. Poorly run and always in the red.

Managers attempt to write up staff at the end of the year to prevent giving pay raises. Overall environment is very unprofessional with very immature employees but management worries more about obtaining magnet status and numbers. There is no respect, appreciation or gratitude for those employees who work hard and are dedicated. Many of us have devoted many years to the Dept but in the end have found new employment. Managers will sit in meetings on their cell phones yet if someone is caught with one in a non-patient area checking their phone it's a huge offense. Managers have created an environment to turn staff against one another and they no longer trust each other.  Even have lost outstanding radiologists due to poor management.
