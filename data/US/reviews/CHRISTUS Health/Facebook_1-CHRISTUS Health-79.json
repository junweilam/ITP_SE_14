I heard one of them literally say \"Im the boss, when I say jump you say how high\" and \"if you don't do X. Ill just fire you\". While it is true that an employer can fire you for any reason in Texas, using profanity or being a jerk is taking it a bit too far. I am all for firing people for cause but that doesnt happen here. Promotions are also not based on merit but on the rapport you have with C level execs.
