Perhaps other departments are better but Student Health Services gets no respect from \"upstairs\".  The only good thing are the employees in Student health. Your coworkers will be what get you through. If you are a full time employee, however, you will enjoy state benefits. As a part time employee though you will not receive any benefits.  I've heard positive things from other departments within the university and for the most part employees in student health are one in a million.", "cons": "Would not recommend this. Other departments at ODU may be okay to work for. However, Student Health Services is not appreciated by any of the \"upper crusted\" management. Within the department, supervisors are lazy and very few actually perform their supervisory role; instead just collect a paycheck. It was very rare to see the supervisor step up and fill in for someone who may have missed work. This type of thing seemed to be beneath them. The only thing that this department cares about or is even remotely worried about are the students; which in turn just results in spoon feeding these COLLEGE aged children. I was actually told by a supervisor once that \"the employees needs are not important in the Health Center.\" Any place that treats their employees this way and believes that their employees needs are not important or of value is not a place I would recommend working. As a part time employee they truly treat you like the low man on the totem pole. They think that you have no life and that your life should revolve around the health center, as a part time employee-I think NOT! Another thing is that they think part-time means working every day. This is fine if a person is okay with shorter shifts, perhaps an older individual but for most people a 4 hour shift is not really worth the time of driving and fighting traffic. Spreading the allotted 29 hours over 5 days is ridiculous. This leads to the next downfall: part-time employees are limited to 29hours/week which is about 1500 hours per year. As the old saying goes, a team is only as good as their leader and this department needs to take this advice and seriously look at who the \"leaders\" are and do an overhaul. It is actually laughable the amount of crap this place puts their employees through especially the low ranking part timers. It is also shameful the way they treat employees that have been here for many years. There is no support for these employees. Also to note, I have never had a supervisor that tells your personal business to other employees until I worked here. Working in health care you think they would know a thing or two about confidentiality. When I tell my supervisor something in confidence I expect it to be kept that way but not the case here.
