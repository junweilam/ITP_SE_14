I began bringing attention to the many violations that I witnessed being performed by the staff within the organization. I worked there for 1 year and my time as an employee could best be described as stressful and miserable. I would never recommend this hospital to anyone considering employment there. I have witnessed numerous unsafe and unsanitary work conditions that are rarely, if ever, addressed by management. The Phlebotomy Department is extremely cliquey and the staff are unhappy due to the low wages, no advancement opportunities, bullying, and favoritism. Overtime and desired shifts are reserved for members of the current clique in power although no one seems to last long as they have a very high turnover rate. The current management has no managerial experience, no training, and zero accountability and still was promoted due to favoritism of management who has since been fired for sexual harassment of a former employee. There is a general unprofessional work environment causing a lack of communication and accountability which makes working there very stressful. I would describe it as toxic place to work. I have witnessed staff tampering with patients blood work by opening 3 tubes and pouring them into 1 (which is not permitted) for A Type Screen. Staff at Holyoke Medical Center rarely wash their hands after drawing patients blood. Staff rarely clean the lab chairs after blood draws. Gloves are limited. Tourniquets are reused on multiple patients during blood draws. No goggles are provided to the staff. No splash guards are available to protect staff while labeling patient specimens. Needle sharp containers are overflowing as are the garbage cans with blood soiled gauze. Staff uses larger gauged needles to fill the tubes of blood faster causing discomfort to the patients. Improper use of heel sticks by staff to perform finger sticks on patients to draw blood faster which is not commonly acceptable or proper procedure. Patients should exercise caution when visiting Holyoke Medical Center as patient safety and care seem not to be a priority to this hospital. Confidential and personal patient files are poorly handled and are often left unattended for anyone to read/browse. Staff openly discuss patients information in common areas of the hospital. If your blood work is not ordered STAT it will be left unattended and vulnerable to being placed in the rack inside a clear opened plastic box in the blood draw room for an extended period of time. Tubes of blood are often mishandled and go missing. Extensive wait times can be expected due to call outs by staff. Staff members are often on their cell phones, or hiding in the back ignoring the patients waiting in the lobby or take extended lunch and or coffee breaks. I have witnessed a employee smoking her vape pen inside of the phlebotomy laboratory in front of other employees in violation of state law and company policy. This woman happened to be friends with the current management so she was never reprimanded. This hospital is infested with cockroaches on the top and bottom floor predominantly. They run across the lab floor like kids in a candy store. Staff sometimes catches the insects in containers used for urine samples and leave them on the desk of management. They are just ignored and business goes on as usual. Holyoke Medical Center has an increasingly high turnover rate for hospitals in the state. The Laboratory Department management was a predator who abused his power and position of authority. He was terminated from Holyoke Medical Center and his previous place of employment for sexual harassment, violating company policy, and for poaching a female staff members personal phone number from the employee files for his own use. Both the male and female management were demoted and are currently no longer with the company. Six employees were also fired within the 1 year I was employed. Many were terminated due to issues regarding errors made labeling a patients blood sample. I alerted Human Resources and Administration of the multiple disturbing events I had personally witnessed. I submitted multiple written and verbal complaints. They were ignored and shortly after I was removed from the daily employee schedule reducing my hours to zero. I believe that qualifies as workplace retaliation. They then stopped scheduling me for all future shifts and I was told to not return back to the Phlebotomy Department. Retaliation is fairly commonplace at Holyoke Medical Center. I understand that every hospital is a business but their daily practices which happen frequently are a wake up call and should raise concern for the community which it serves and general public safety at large. I felt it my duty and obligation to alert anyone thinking of using this hospital to know the truth. Hope this makes a difference."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 May 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Holyoke, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people here are friendly and easy to get a long with.
