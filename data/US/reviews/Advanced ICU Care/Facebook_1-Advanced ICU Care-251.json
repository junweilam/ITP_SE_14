Where to start?\r\n-Tone deaf management.  Upper management has been replaced, and cronyism-ed so badly, that no one can tell management what is wrong, or the most efficient way to do something.  When someone in upper management has an idea, that is the policy you will take, especially to the detriment to... everyone and everything.  \r\n-understaffed, and overworked clinical staff.  The company has grown double within the last couple years, in terms of bedsides monitored, but have not grown the number of doctors per bedside sufficiently enough to make it worth-while.  \r\n-Nursing staff has terrible turn-over, due to poor management.  Nursing management is often overbearing, aggressive, and out-of-touch with how everything actually works.  \r\n-Doctors, though over provisioned for hospital beds, are also treated like mini-gods.  Some Doctors expected to be catered to for everything, including forcing -other doctors- to move stations, so that particular doctor could sit at his 'favorite' station.  (Not inconsequential since it takes about 20 minutes to log in and get set up).\r\n-Clinical Support Staff (Effectively IT helpdesk) is mostly useless.  there are 1 or 2 technicians who seem to want to help, but most of them take zero initiative to fix or follow through a issue, they just act as a phone receptionist for IT problems.  They'll 'make a ticket', and escalate it to someone higher up in IT.  Not a great solution when you're working with high risk patients all day.\r\n-Customer Account Management is a massive debacle, as none of the client account managers wants to actually manage their accounts, barely acting like anything more than a nodding head, agreeing to almost anything a client wants, even if it's not feasible.  \r\n-There are individuals in upper management brought in by nepotism who can 'do no wrong'.  Former Employees who have spoken out against them have been ostracized or completely ignored until they left the company.\r\n-IT is a shambles in general.  They've lost IT leadership 7 times, and they have, more than once, hired leadership with little to no actual IT experience, but apparently don't listen to what their reportees tell them.  Projects that should be vetted better end up in production on the operations center floor, and flounder because upper management forced them through, even though they were warned it was far from a usable product.  \r\n-Upper management has wasted money on pet projects that were doomed to failure, and were told were going to fail from day one, with every warning sign imaginable, but still spent 6 figure dollar sums and committed to multi-year service contracts, which collapsed within six months.\r\n-An HR department that was regularly antagonistic towards employees in favor of shielding upper management, leaving employees with little recourse on how to actually address problems.  \r\n-a top level manager who, in the middle of a company wide corporate call, told everyone 'we're doing well right now, but the economy hasn't quite picked up yet, and you're all lucky to have this job, and that there are plenty of people out there who would love to have a job here (or as most people took it: 'you're easily replaced').  \r\n-Pay well below the average rate for many positions inside the company, often times paying a well trained, experienced, loyal employee poorly, until they leave to make far better money with less work, and/or a better title, and then the company hires a replacement at 10-25% more than the previous employee SHOULD have been making, but with the new person having a quarter of the experience and skills necessary to do the job.\r\n-Several times, when someone would leave the company, they would just take that person's responsibilities, an instead of hiring a replacement, dumping the responsibilities on one or more other, already overworked, people.   While leaving other departments who are overstaffed and under worked completely untouched.\r\n-promoted one 'individual' to a crucial position over a department (with title change a jump up from their previous position) that is hugely important to the function of the company, when they had zero experience inside that field, and no skills that could even translate over to work in it.  crashed the entire department to a complete stand still, and was so mis-managed that I hear they are -still- trying to recover from it, even though they've fired that person and brought in someone with actual experience in that role.  The person they promoted wasn't even fired, they left for medical leave, and then quit afterwards.  They were never reprimanded for their massive failures, even when one of those failures almost shut the entire company down from a legal standpoint.  \r\n-Much of the management in the company takes credit for the ideas or work that regular employees do, but then throw those same employees under the bus if something goes awry.\r\n-For a company that relies on IT as a backbone of it's services, it drastically understaffs it's IT group, often only having one person per role, with no good backups, leaving outstanding issues sitting if someone goes on vacation.  (This happens elsewhere in the company, but IT seems to be the worst offender of this).\r\n-Top level Manager who actively worked to push out a well regarded director (who was hired under the previous Mangement), and then worked to ruin that previous directors job prospects outside of Advanced ICU Care.  \r\n-Most of upper management is from either California, or NY.  There is a real sense of superiority coming from the people in those locations over any of the other locations."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor Management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive pay, benefits are good, small enough company to know everyone.", "cons": "Management inexperienced, inconsistent, and has employee \"favorites\""}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Stay Clear", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Data Specialist in Creve Coeur, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay, nice building, and one hour breaks", "cons": "Extra mean coworkers, freezing temps in the monitoring center, management only cares about flawed work flow, working with minimal staff, and unrealistic expectations"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "RN", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Technology driven, not physically stressful but mentally challenging.
