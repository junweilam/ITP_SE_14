My supervisor encouraged the TAs to be independent when organizing lessons and leading experiments. I appreciate how much she trusted us with the role, I never felt stifled. We could grade, quiz, and do exams at the pace of the class. She also understood our busy schedule, so we typically graded at our own pace. I liked grading as soon as possible, but if I had a heavy class week, I had the room to grade a little later if necessary.", "cons": "My one comment would be organization. If you are very self-motivated, this will not be a problem. You must be on top of requesting the experiments and chemicals from the supervising lab coordinator. Everyone in the department is very busy, and requesting things ahead of time is optimal for having the best results in class. Other than that, you should be great. You might also find that you love teaching, as I did! :)"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Student Worker in Huntsville, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great staff and good administration", "cons": "Communication is not its best"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Head", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 May 2023", "job_title": "Camp Cousellor in Birmingham, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to be and work", "cons": "Small, needs to be updated, food is ok"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Challenging Workplace", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "27 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Database Manager in Huntsville, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people.
