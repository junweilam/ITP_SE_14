QUAD, formerly called AIM (Artificial Intelligence in Medicine) develops Nuclear Cardiology software. Pros: - Start at 16 days/year of paid vacation, which increase to 21 after 3 years. - Excellent medical benefits - Cedars-Sinai as a whole is a solid company - You get a paycheck", "cons": "One problem with QUAD is that new hires are not compensated in a competitive way. As such QUAD can possibly be a decent foot-in-the-door job, but you shouldn't stay here any more than 2 years unless you find you love it. My time at AIM/QUAD started off well enough, but over the many years I was there I was never promoted and my salary never increased in any meaningful way, until right before I left, and even then it still wasn't brought up to a competitive market rate. \r\n\r\nAt one point I had to confront someone in a leadership position with verbally abusing us for 2 hours during a team meeting. There were leadership changes, and after that things got even worse for me. A leader with no software engineering experience insisted on timeline estimates for when new features would be completed, and pushed for estimates that were not realistic. If I then failed to meet those unrealistic time estimates, I was asked to work holiday weekends to make up time, and overall life was made miserable for me, because even if I met a deadline, the best I could hope to hear was \"Okay so the next thing we need done is...\" No one at QUAD ever celebrates a teammate's successes. There is very little teamwork/collaboration between developers at QUAD. If you are hired, you are expected to be competent, work on your project mostly in isolation, and look up anything you don't know yourself on Google. Some are more friendly and will help if you ask, but others will have attitude if you do. \r\n\r\nAnother issue at QUAD is that you are expected to wear many hats. I did not just do software engineering but also DevOps tasks. This makes it difficult to specialize, which is required if you want to advance your career.\r\n\r\nSince leaving QUAD, I've joined another company that has amazing teamwork/collaboration, wonderful mentorship for more Jr. engineers, far better compensation, no micromanagement, and no asking people to work on weekends. I specialize in my chosen area, and am surrounded with friendly teammates who also specialize in my area, so we all help each other grow.

More to the point, in my experience and in my personal situation, there was nothing in place to actually measure an employee's contributions, skills, development, etc. What this allows, is for a manager to basically promote (or demonize) whoever they \"feel\" is in their best interest. I also realize, sadly, that this is probably more common than not when a company gets to sufficient size. \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine that's not very motivating.

I obviously understand that companies probably don't try to hand out promotions like candy (however if they're smart, it IS in their best interest to try and retain good employees). However, not being clear in any way at all, will, and has in CSMC's case, lead to many employees leaving.

Mid-level management usually have never ascended the career path as a study coordinator or held any progressive role in clinical research. \r\n\r\nMid-level management usually come into their roles due to the politics of faculty members. The people at this level are rewarded for not rocking the boat and for keeping things status-quo. As a result, high quality employees become frustrated with mid-level management's inability to 1) relate to the work that the clinical research staff is doing 2) protect and provide effective leadership for clinical research staff from investigators or other ancillary departments and 3) fail to understand how the value of the staff should be rewarded with career advancement to help retain top talent. \r\n\r\nInstead, mid-level management will always keep senior management's best interest in mind and make decisions that harm the staff working the hardest. At whatever level you are brought in at Cedars, you will have a hard time advancing in terms of salary. Once you are brought in at a level, that will forever be your benchmark as you advance in higher roles. Even if your worth is closer to a mid-point in a salary range, you will always be given the lowest of that scale because you've advanced from a lower salary title scale. Their compensation practices for internal talent is outdated and has resulted in countless top talent being lost. \r\n\r\nAlso, because mid-level management does not possess the skills necessary to manage clinical research staff and/or a clinical research portfolio, the management of sponsored research funds can be irresponsible. Budgeting for clinical trials is underestimated, which results in department-wide deficits. In other departments where budgets are done correctly, excess funds may sometimes be used to cover the department's operational deficits. Either way, the clinical research staff working the hardest to deliver top quality studies are not protected financially. The end result is mid-level management always cutting corners at the bottom to cover the interests of those at the top. \r\n\r\nLastly, Human Resources does a poor job at investigating staff concerns of documented and fact-based reports of bullying, harassment, and retaliation. HR sides with middle-management and goes as far as reprimand employees on how they should be behaving towards middle-management. HR will prefer to hold the door open for top talent leaving than to rock the boat with thorough investigations for middle-management. \r\n\r\nHR will also be involved in advising management of unverified concerns regarding internal transfers for promotional opportunities which has resulted in talent being \"black listed\" for openings in the hospital."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Overworked", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay was good, medical plan was cheap, nice 401k.
