I've made some very good friends working here!", "cons": "After working here (for near a third of my life) I will be leaving for so many reasons! They are not family oriented at all. For instance, I needed to change shifts to accommodate changes with family at home, put in for a transfer and was denied. Which is a shame because they can't keep staff for anything. They keep raising the wage, but it's not worth staying. They don't offer medical to part timers, though most of the positions are part time and part timers work more than full time hours on most days because of the lack of coverage. Managements horrible! My manager has absolutely no clue what she's doing, and she's the one that's supposed to be training me. I've been trained wrong and had to go to other managers or RA2s or 3s (who also plan to leave the company) for the correct training. My clients have been left behind and put on the back burner for so long simply because they don't live in a group home owned by BLDC. They expect me to do my job, but don't give me the resources to do so. For instance, we have gone paperless. All our documentation is electronic. This happened over a year ago. I have yet to be given a laptop to work on at my clients home. When I need to do paperwork, I have to go sit in a 5'x9' vestibule where everyone clocks in and out at. No a.c./heat. Just between 2 glass doors. Always filled with flies from people coming in and out during the day. Not pleasant. It's not really about the clients anymore. It's a giant power struggle, \"who's in control\", kinda deal. All they care about anymore is how we look on paper for CARF (accreditor). They come every 3 yrs, so every 3 yrs it's a cluster of madness trying to make sure everything's up to date and in the system when really there's no reason to not be on top of all that at all times. All the managers are awful. Its not about \"how can I help you to be more efficient in your position?\" its, \"I'm gonna start writing memos and DAs and this will go in your performance appraisal!\" I would never recommend this job to anyone, and that's sad because I love the clients and they deserve so much better!!!!! I pray that BLDC gets bought out by a better organization that can do/give better for the clients! Not to mention, they waste money senselessly, but then we have clients that bring home $2 paychecks every 2 weeks because they don't provide/find work for them. Sad huh, who can live off of that? Which leads me to the process of requesting money from payees. The clients rarely get their money by the time they need it, then staff have angry clients they have to de-escalate because they can't do/buy what they want/need. Its all crap, simply put. Wish it wasn't, hasn't always been, but it just is.
