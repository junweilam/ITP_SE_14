Poor facilities for basic research. Some examples:\r\n- IT will not allow you to install software for your research. Even software for instruments takes IT a long time to clear to get installed. IT support is specific for clinical work but if you are doing basic research it is inadequate. Using your computer to connect to their network is also a nightmare.\r\n- Infrastructure for research is outdated. The clinical part of the hospital is fine but the labs for basic research are old. Temperatures in certain instrument rooms go very high in the summer, borderline damaging instruments.\r\n- Core facilities are good but the institution provides very little support to them, making them understaffed/overworked.\r\n- Instrument service plans by official vendors do not get approved, making instrument failures catastrophic and again slowing down research.\r\nOverall, surprisingly poor infrastructure considering they are a Harvard Medical School affiliated hospital. \r\n4. Understaffed immigration office. If you are a postdoc and are on a visa you have to be on top of your immigration documents at all times, else you could be stuck. Fellow researchers had to leave the country for prolonged periods or permanently due to visa issues which could have been avoided.\r\n5. No internal funding opportunities for postdocs e.g. no travel awards etc. If they are there, they are not well advertised in any way.\r\n6. No clear pathway to progress up and get promoted even if you have exceptional performance in your annual review.\r\n7. Health insurance and benefits provided are more expensive in comparison to neighboring institutes in the Longwood Medical area."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "BIDMC", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Physiologist in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome doctors and staff, good learning experience", "cons": "you dont get a raise for doing an exceptional job"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "RN, BSN", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive colleagues, safe, respected, inclusive", "cons": "Limited parking, non-union, potentially lower pay"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Instructor position", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Instructor in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "As a researcher, BIDMC is a bit of a research hub- plenty of people working just down the corridor with super exciting tools and methods.
