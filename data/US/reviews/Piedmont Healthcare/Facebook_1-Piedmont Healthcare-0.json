The copay/premiums are also very high for you to be staying within their provider system. \n- Very lack luster management - not interested in their employees, tend to stir the pot by adding drama to the unit, friends with HR/directors so can be hard to voice a complaint, side with doctors/physicians over nurses/nurse practitioners,\n- Don't invest in the growth of their employees - current employees cannot participate in the EPEP program for shadowing opportunities under different providers/physicians. Only Pre-PA/Pre-Med students are allowed. CMAs looking to become RN's, RN's looking to become NP's will not be able to access Piedmont's EPEP program.

In many cases management is hired from outside rather than promoting from within the company.  If promotions from within the company do occur, it is more often based on the good-ole-boy system (friends, favors, etc...) which results in many people in management with no leadership ability (and with the lack of any internal training, new managers who have never managed before are ill-prepared to tackle this role leaving the employees very disgruntled since the new manager does not know what they are doing). \r\n\r\nHuman Resources\r\nHR does not investigate issues and concerns brought about by employees but rather chat with the manager to get their opinion and use that as the conclusion.  The lack of any impartiality from HR results in the employee base not trusting HR.  Secondly, HR does not evaluate whether new applicants meet the minimum qualifications for the job.  If the person was referred by someone high up in the company, they are rubber stamped and fast-tracked into the position.

If you start with doing floor runs it may take you years or you'll maybe never get into the IV room or OR satellite. Management moves up and trains people in different areas depending on if they like you personally or not. For example,  pharmacy students work here NONE of them have ever been trained in the IV room or OR satellite they only do runs, and they've been here for years. Another downfall of refusing to cross-train coupled with high turnover is there's constantly holes in the schedule putting more workload on other techs. If everyone was cross-trained anybody could pick up those shifts making it easier for everyone. I've never worked at a hospital where everybody wasn't able to do everything, it just hurts the department in the end. \r\n\r\n The workload is extremely heavy.
