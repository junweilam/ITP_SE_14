In addition, and most importantly, I was treated like a professional.      As a matter of fact the ONLY thing IPRO offers is the compressed schedule, take that away and watch the mass exodus happen.  \r\nA few years ago IPRO cut the number of sick days in half\u2026..at the same time we don\u2019t want to spread communicable diseases like the flu as our clients; the Department of Health and CDC advise,    Many of us work in and out of hospitals and clinics where the communicability of these infectious agents is greatly enhanced.
