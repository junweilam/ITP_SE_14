Some upper management lacks basic knowledge about marketing and engage in outdated practices for decades. If you want to learn from the best and become an expert - this is not a place for you. I was going through constant toxicity and emotional abuse from my manager. He would \"threaten\" me that I could lose my job any minute, although my performance was great. He would take credit for any good work produced by me but when projects did not sit well with the upper management, he would put full blame on me and claim he had nothing to do with it. I got fired because he did not take responsibility and neither HR nor upper management investigated it how they should have. I had so much proof that he lied on me, I offered to show it twice, but they did not look at it. They have never given me any warnings, but chose to simply get rid of me because there was a personal issue, where my manager could not handle me getting any recognition.
