Decisions are repeatedly top down with little to no consideration of students, employees or implementation and are ironically often reversed.  Also, an acute fear of reprieval exists on the campus management level.  In one instance a PhD senior faculty member who was diagnosed with terminal cancer felt the need to keep it a secret until a week before she died.  She hid this because she was petrified that if she revealed her condition she would be fired.  Sadly, I agree.  Illinois is an at-will state and employees can and are fired for whatever reason.  One day this included the campus President, Director of Operations, Director of Human Resources, One of the IT guys and a worker from the library.  I mention this because job security and being fired is a consistantly and openly stated fear in the company, even among the best employees.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is little career growth on the campus level.  A person doesn't move up from a local campus level... or it is very very difficult and yet to be demonstrated in my four years of working there.  The hours and pressure to get admissions can be intense and at the local campus level it is a very high context environment.  In other words, you are very aware of your place and rank when things get tense.  \r\n\r\nWhen looking for other jobs, I have been told that the for-profit education sector's former employees are judged unfairly in interviews and it can become a vortex that keeps you in for-profit education (though I have never experienced that myself, nor have I known of anyone NOT getting hired because of their for-profit experience per se).\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a lot of pressure with lawmakers and the gainful employment laws.  Massive lobbying has apparently taken the teeth out of the legislation, but there was a lot revealed when congress did those investigations.  As a result, morale is rock bottom, management doesn't get it and this is why the stock is the lowest it has ever been. With the way things are, I would bet Argosy is being poised to be purchased.  I do not expect this company to survive in the long run.

And of course, it would be your funeral if you tried to bring up the fact that the leads were crap. You'd be spoonfed a statement like \"there's no such thing as a bad lead.\" Absolute garbage. The other major frustration I had was the restructuring of the company. They changed the management of regions and we had a new regional manager type (I forget the actual title), who was in charge of a few of the Argosy locations. This person was awful. They used intimidation and they had absolutely no people skills at all. This person didn't like the approach of one of the admissions reps, so they sat at the AR's desk for hours one day. They also talked down to others, which was not ok. My other issue was with the employee review process. There are several competencies, like professionalism, product knowledge, student focus, and a few others. Now say that you don't hit your expected numbers. They will start to change your different competencies from \"exceeds\" or \"meets expectations\" to \"below expectations.\" It's frustrating to be completely professional at all times and representing the company well, but as soon as you're not hitting your numbers, they might say \"well, if you're not getting students, then you must not be professional.\" But since they can't actually fire you for not hitting your numbers, then this is how they have to do it I suppose.

NOT THE CASE every single miserable day I would sit at my desk, with my headset on making phone calls for 8.5 hours or I was in a training session about making phone calls. Nothing exciting about it in the slightest. \r\n\r\nLack of job security- In my location, new groups of Success Advisors were being hired every single month, but the pool of students who were willing and able to go to school wasn't getting any bigger. This put a lot of pressure on SAs to stay on top of their game because it was very obvious that everyone was replaceable, layoffs were constant. \r\n\r\nSales- I took this position because I was excited to help students, unfortunately, that's a very tiny part of this job. Management is OBSESSED with numbers! I spent most of my day calling through a random pool of numbers and reading a script. Hardly anyone you speak to is actually interested in school, that doesn't matter to management, though. You are supposed to get these people into a program whether they're interested or not. Many times while talking to a potential student I would come to the realization that school wasn't the best option for them financially, that doesn't matter to management either because they think nothing of having a student take out all sorts of loans. Many times I would gracefully end the call without signing them up for school, because in good conscience I just couldn't. This would always get me in trouble as all of the calls are recorded and letting someone go without getting them enrolled is a big no no. \r\n\r\nLack of Recognition- No matter what you do it's never enough at this place. You can reach all your goals or even surpass them but management will always be there to remind you that you should be doing more. \r\n\r\nWork Life Balance- During the interview process, it was made to seem as if the position had a set schedule and if you were willing and able to stay late or come in on weekends to \"help\" students you were more than welcome to. However, once I was in the position I was constantly pressured to stay after normal business hours and come in on weekends. I was made to feel like the work I accomplished during my 8.5 hour day meant nothing if I wasn't staying late. It didn't matter that I had children to pick up from daycare at the end of the day. I did come in one Saturday and learned that by \"helping\" students they meant making more obnoxious telemarketing calls to uninterested people.\r\n\r\nManagement- I believe that many of the SAs care about the well being of the students but management couldn't care less.
