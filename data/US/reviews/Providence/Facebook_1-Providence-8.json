In that time, COVID has changed the landscape much. When I started it was a very nurturing enviornment for a baby nurse to learn - I was accepted into the RN residency program in fall 2000 and it was an amazing place to learn and grow. Pay was about on par with local hospitals and benefit packages were sufficient.", "cons": "The largest problem has been that Providence (Everett) management has been at war with the nurse's union to the point where they increasingly do not communicate and work with the nurses (through our union) and slowly over time things have gone from bad to worse. I really saw how horrible our union was treated during contract negotiations when they offered the nursing staff a 1% raise and were going to take away benefits such as our EIB, or earned income benefits which are accrued and pay out when we are sick beyond the first set number of hours - a critical benefit that we had had in our contract. When I started, we enjoyed a 4:1 ratio of patients to RN on our orthopedic floor. Most of the Med Surg floors were similar. It has gone from that ratio to 5:1 and most recently to 6:1 as of February 2023. I finally left because I did not feel safe with the patient loads they were heaping onto the RNs. The company has been hemorrhaging nurses and has not incentivized them to stay with the company nor has it provided updates on how to remediate the problem. The CEO left a few months ago and the new CEO has not discussed staffing issues for several months and only emailed the employees to discuss how a TikTok video claiming the RN's had to take 8 patients one night was false (I've heard the video was accurate in that all the nurses called out the next day when they found out they were going to be given 8 patient loads a second time). While 6:1 ratios are the new normal there, 7:1 have happened here and there as well (as well as a very few 8:1 times). Providence has not discussed any plan with the workers on how to get out of this problem. They are loading the staff up with so many patients that they quit and leave and go to other jobs. We all know the CEOs and management make millions of dollars (despite being non-profit, or not for profit or whatever) and so it feels pretty slimy to work for an organization that really does not put it's frontline workers first. Providence may be the one reason that safe staffing legislation actually gets passed because it is becoming so dangerous to work there that people are leaving for safer environments. Many managers on the floors have left Providence now (we have lost three managers (all in the same position) recently and the position is once again open all within a year's time - the reason why?

What kind of nonsense is that? I have to burn my PTO while I am sick, even though I have earned sick pay? It seems like this was an effort to discourage employees from calling out sick for the day, but what sort of message does this send to employees, really? We are going to punish you for taking care of yourself while you are ill? Even though we are a healthcare provider? This is one example where Providence talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk. Their whole mission is \"easing the way\" for patients and staff- how did this ease my way when I was out sick? \r\n\r\n- No specific hours set aside for vacation or holidays. PTO is one lumped pool, so for holidays you have to make sure you have enough time set aside in your bank. Otherwise, you could be in the negative. What an odd and unhelpful system. This may have changed since I left the organization, but I would recommend asking recruitment about this during your application process. - Hounding patients to pay, even when they should be receiving financial support or free care. I felt so many examples that were brought up in the recent NY Times article resonated with my past experience as an employee. I was forced to ask people about how they could pay for their children's specialist visits out in public in the lobby where others could hear. I have had mothers cry in front of me and others about how they cannot pay, but still was instructed to ask for a \"good faith payment of at least 25 dollars\". If they couldn't pay that, we asked for whatever they could afford. How is this caring for the poor and vulnerable, as the mission states? It has now come out in a more recent article that Providence will now be making an effort to refund patients who were wrongly charged (even sent to collections might I add), but this is only happening after they were called out by the NY Times. Really shameful in my opinion.\r\n\r\n-Very challenging to get out of entry level positions. I had to eventually leave to see any career growth/development. I tried multiple times to ask for more responsibility, more training and more opportunities. I spent 3 years in an entry level position with a bachelor's degree and then a master's degree for the last year. Partially my fault for holding out hope for a promotion or new internal opportunity, I was loyal to a fault. Learned the hard way by wasting my own time. - Providence recently (about 3-4 years ago) outsourced their HR department to another country. This really highlights the point that how they treat and care for their staff is not top priority. When I was trying to transfer to another internal position, it was an absolute nightmare. I didn't have a point person to contact when I had questions about the process, pay or general questions. I understand that large companies often opt to outsource HR/Benefits, but the company they have chosen to partner with serves more as a barrier than a support in my experience. \r\n\r\n- Working for such a large organization, has its cons. I found that a lot of direction and messaging coming from the top felt out of touch with what was really happening in the clinics, this was especially the case during the pandemic. There was the occasional bonus pay (which is great but not enough- this was the standard amongst most healthcare organizations at the time) as well signs calling us \"heroes\", which I personally found patronizing as nurses and other staff literally risked their lives as they were underappreciated and underpaid. \r\n\r\n- From my experience, culture was very competitive, people were looking out for themselves mostly, but that was truer in the first clinic I worked in than the second, take this with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\n- Lastly, I would just advise any potential applicants to think twice about working for Providence. They really indoctrinate staff with the mission of \"caring for the most poor and vulnerable\" and \"easing the way of patients and staff\" but I feel like they are benefiting off/hiding behind the original mission from the founding Sisters and not really caring to make an effort to apply this to modern times or healthcare. Providence's messaging from the top constantly harkens back to the how they began and their heritage, but they have let greed blind them. I would love for them to truly reflect; \"what would our founding Sisters say about how we operate today?\""}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Na", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Burbank, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great con workers and that\u2019s about it", "cons": "None at the very moment"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Overall good workplace", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Audiologist in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "work/life balance positive work place flexibility", "cons": "poor pay unfair salary lack leadership"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Pretty good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Medford, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good long term benefits, long training period.", "cons": "Location being in Medford, Oregon."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "used to be great", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Beaverton, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "still a bit of the small community and helpfulness left free phlebotomy class", "cons": "lowest pay in industry. less than a care home. consistently understaffed. but not just normal understaffing purposeful cutting down amount of cnas on units. in the year i worked there as a cna we went from regularly having 5-6 cnas on our floor to regularly having 2-3"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "okay place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Pharmacy Technician in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "they are more relaxed and not as strict", "cons": "pay rate is pretty low,"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Hard times in Healthcare", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "2 Dec 2022", "job_title": "ICU Registered Nurse in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Every unit has its support people - meaning it\u2019s easy to make friends on the unit and friends = better working environment.", "cons": "Like every healthcare system - post covid healthcare is HARD.

Law enforcement agencies hold Providence security with good regards.\r\n\r\nI can start by saying that the healthcare plan and HSA is a huge bonus to working for Providence. I pay almost nothing for my medical, dental and vision plans, dumping excess into my HSA and retirement.\r\n\r\nThe shift differentials for swing ($1.50) and grave ($3.50) are incredibly enticing, especially for anyone who's experienced working security elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt's not contracted security and staff treat you with respect. It's a great feeling to be the one medical staff call in to solve issues and defuse volatile situations. In some considerations sometimes you have to play devil's advocate, bouncer or emotional support.\r\n\r\nThere's a dozen locations to work, you aren't bound to one hospital and you get to experience how different places are ran, if you don't choose to take a job at one location. There aren't only just hospitals to work at either (clinics, office buildings, mobile patrol).\r\n\r\nThe equipment issued is of moderate quality. Everything you carry is issued and paid for by Providence. Uniform policy is relaxed and more dependent on the location and supervisor. \r\n\r\nProvidence provides it's own certification academy that gives you an idea and prepares you to work in a hospital. Providence pays for all the necessary certifications. Providence is investing more into training by directly showing us.\r\n\r\nProvidence covers you on on the job injuries and helps support you. Dealing with their 3rd party workers compensation is hit and miss.\r\n\r\nMost of your coworkers in security are great people. It's easy to joke around and have fun with eachother.\r\n\r\nThe job itself is relatively easy. Most of the time you'll respond to dispatch calls or conduct proactive patrols. You're left up to your own on most occasions.", "cons": "Non-unionized. Almost all of the medical and support staff have a union, security doesn't. It's hard doing your job when there's fear of reprisals coming from other department's unions. Providence expects us to enforce policy on staff that have more power than we do.\r\n\r\n5 ON 2 OFF schedule. The schedule is terrible and doesn't give you enough time to decompress after stressful days. We're stuck on 5 day work weeks because the dinosaurs don't want 10s or 12s.\r\n\r\nThe job can be stressful trying to keep medical staff, co workers and supervisors happy. Sometimes you have to go against what someone wants, sometimes coming at a cost. If you aren't a politician you'll have to learn fast.\r\n\r\nSome days you'll be running around all day, it isn't uncommon having no time to take a lunch. Providence only gives a 30 minute unpaid lunch with the expectation that you'll stay on campus \"in case\" anything happens.\r\n\r\nComing from security it was a big learning curve, especially how Providence wants things handled. Department policy is liberal but hard to balance politics between medical staff. There's lots of policy that needs to be understood, not including the legal requirements hospitals have to adhere to\r\n\r\nYou're expected to RUN to situations and fight when necessary. I wasn't used to fighting coming in the gate, it is a learning curve I'm still managing.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have interest in fighting or physically restraining people this isn't the job for you. It's a common occurrence that you'll have to deal with drunks, psychs, incredibly disrespectful people and very violent people. I have been spit on, bit and called unimaginable things from people ranging from children all the way to grandma's. If you can't control your emotions you'll end up hurt or without a job. Being able to talk to people should be a top priority when hiring people.\r\n\r\nThe police and jails send their problems to the hospitals. It's not uncommon to have police dump people off and run away.\r\n\r\nYou'll have frequent interactions with psychiatric patients. It's challenging and sometimes dangerous being placed into situations trying to balance safety for yourself, other staff and the patient. It can also get frustrating dealing with the same aggressive people. If you aren't prepared mentally it can be a rough learning curve. Sometimes medical staff don't understand your perspective, turning situations dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe pay and benefits aren't really aligned with the expectations and duties Providence has. The pay scale is all over the board, from $18/hr ranging to $25/hr starting. There are NO incentives to keep people interested in sticking around. The yearly raises don't even cover the rising cost of inflation. Other local hospitals offer higher wages to their security, some which don't even do half of what we do.\r\n\r\nSome hospitals are giant high schools. Lots of gossip and general immaturity coming from medical staff and support staff. Learning to navigate and keeping your head down is challenging. It makes it even more difficult when you're an introverted person. It's not uncommon for guards to get fired after getting a little too comfortable around medical staff. Holding your tongue is a virtue.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't directly employed at a single hospital scheduling can be challenging. It wasn't uncommon to work double shifts or have quick turn arounds (graves to swings). It's expected that you work at every hospital in the portland area, which could mean working a few days on swing shift at the portland medical center and a day shift at saint vincent's.\r\n\r\nDepending on the location, security managers and supervisors can be hit and miss. Some are genuinely great people, others not so much.\r\n\r\nTraining can be a stressful time. You'll be training at every location and evaluated on your performance. There is no way to learn everything about a hospital when you're not given very much time at locations, some you won't even return to for months or years."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Classic healthcare problems", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Patient Experience Specialist in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good management, good work from home options, good upward company mobility.", "cons": "Very religious (uncomfortable for non relgious employees), over worked, underpaid, angry patients, lack of resources, expectation to always be willing to work overtime."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Not a good place to work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 May 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Spokane, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "12 hours shifts are nice but no vacation time", "cons": "no summer vacation time bc we are super short stuffed"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "wage", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 May 2022", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Mount Angel, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team\r\nwell managed\r\nalways want to improve the quality of service", "cons": "occasionally short-staffed\r\nThere are hardly any places to grab lunch around"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Amazing boss", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Physical Therapist in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great team, even better boss, good pay", "cons": "productivity demands can be challenging"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 May 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Everett, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work with some of the best coworkers and get to see diverse patient population", "cons": "Management is poor.
