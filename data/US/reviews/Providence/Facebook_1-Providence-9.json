This was done as an overreaction to the decentralized way that each site used to operate.  Centralization of things like the EMR was a very good thing (or at least a good idea, if not hastily and aggressively implemented), but they went overboard.  Along with the EMR they also centralized as much of the rest of the IT infrastructure as they could, including the career opportunities.  These days, if you don't live in Orangewood, CA then you don't have a shot at the higher end IT jobs.  All the remote sites offer are basic grunt work IT jobs.  Even then, a lot of the career employees were laid off and their jobs handed to contractors like Gordian Dynamics.  What's worse is that the central teams show no respect for the IT techs at the remote sites.  We're treated with a lot of disrespect and as if we know nothing.  That pretty closely sums up the state of the IT culture at Saint Joseph: the central teams think that remote sites are full of idiots, and the remote sites think that the central team is full of jerks.\r\n\r\nWhether they are overworked, understaffed, or just plain slow and stupid, the central teams move at a snails pace and don't support the remote sites very well.  The hyper centralization puts remote sites in a position where they are entirely dependent on the central teams to deploy configurations or run reports in order for us to do our jobs, but it takes months for them to do anything.  This leads remote site techs to come up with cheap hacks and workarounds.  Many settings that would be best deployed via Group Policy or SCCM are instead configured locally because it's just easier than dealing with the central team attitude, and we at least have the ability to manage it ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe CIO wants to lead a company like Apple or Facebook.  He's lost sight of the fact that he's ultimately an IT manager, not an innovative software company CEO; but he's running IT in that manner.  He's also a bit too much of a politician (like, he seems accustomed to lying).\r\n\r\nBeing on-call in IT is legally dubious, because you don't get on-call pay while you're on-call; you only get paid if you actually get called in.  Management claims that this is legal because being on-call is \"non restrictive\".  We're told that we don't have to respond when getting paged while on-call.  That's an outright lie.  If we're on-call and get paged but don't respond then we will be in trouble.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, my position is just a job, not a career.

I think the best reason to work for Providence Health & Services is that I am proud to be part of the Providence family for the things that they do for the community.\r\nThere are more, but here are the key points of what I observed so far:\r\n1)\tThe organization treats the employees with respect by welcoming the uniqueness of each individual. This is more than just the Equal Employment Opportunity in writing. You can still be yourself doing what you do best for the organization. I've seen some cubicles decorated with Pokemon, Godzilla, Seahawk, Star Wars, you name it. You will feel like home so quickly. I feel that I don\u2019t have to try hard to fit in because I felt a warm welcome from my peers regardless my look, my race or ethnic.\r\n2)\tThe organization provides health and saving benefits, and also the commuter benefits. As someone who came from out of the state, this is a huge benefit. There is also a benefit for carpooling or bicycling to work. For me, I just love my ORCA to get me to places easily and independently than driving on my own \u2013 parking can be a headache. There are more benefits for commuter that I mentioned here though. Speaking about benefits, I love having the gym in the headquarter buildings with shower.\r\n3)\tThere are plenty of mission driven non-profit organizations out there, but providence walks the talks in everything. I just love how the organization promotes volunteerism that benefits the community. One of many examples, Providence does not just do gardening to beautify the buildings, but to donate the harvest to the community.\r\n4)\tThe recruiter treats the candidate with compassion even when the applied position after position did not work out in the candidate's favor. The recruiter keep in-touch and connects the candidate with other recruiters in different areas of the candidate's interests. In addition to this, the recruiter even follow-up to see if the candidate is doing okay in the job search journey. In my case, this was the team manager. Nowadays, there are only a few recruiters I\u2019ve met that recruit with empathy.\r\n5)\tThe department I am part of always collaborate with others for improvement opportunity. This is aligned with my belief that change is the only thing permanent (by philosopher Heraclitus). There are plenty of resources accessible to learn on my own too. Also, do you ever eat a cookie with a code scanner to a thank you video? I love how creative is the department as they promote creative thinking in their works.\r\n6)\tThe team manager that I am part of, she welcomed me at our first meeting with a hug and warm greetings. She made sure I have everything I need to get started using a tool to guide me through my first 3 weeks. I am not talking about the office supplies, but the required information, the resources, and learning communities to equip me for success in my role.", "cons": "I really did not see anything that I feel disappointed about.

They were told about what was going on and how the newer energetic workers were lying, cheating, backing other employees and not others.
