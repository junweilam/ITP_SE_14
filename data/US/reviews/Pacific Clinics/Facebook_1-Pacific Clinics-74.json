That was not made clear to me upon interviewing and may have deterred me had I know. You must meet a monthly number of clientele which you will be responsible for recruiting or bringing in to the office for assistance. If you do not meet this quota you will receive disciplinary action in multiple forms, but usually by having to meet with management and tell them why you haven't met your numbers and how you will make them up in the following month, in addition to that month's numbers. Because of the natural structure of the program numbers tend to dwindle at certain times of the year but you will be expected to fill your quota regardless. The quota is the most important thing to them. I was denied vacation time for not meeting quotas in consecutive months. \r\n\r\n-Micromanagement is the law of the land. This can be helpful when you are new and need a lot of guidance, however it quickly becomes unhelpful once you know how to perform your role. \r\n\r\n- The pay is very low considering all of the roles and responsibilities you will fill and that they are requiring a bachelors degree. As with many jobs, the longer you stay and more seasoned you become the more you get on your plate. However your pay will not increase and there is no position to promote to. \r\n\r\n-Management will not stand behind you when it comes to student confrontation or disrespect. If a student becomes vocally upset or abuses you verbally, it will be entirely up to you and your coworkers to defuse the situation, and if you don't succeed in this you will have to have a meeting with your supervisor to discuss what you could have done better. You will not be provided any training in de-escalation or crisis prevention as you are not considered \"clinical\" staff. \r\n\r\n-High turn over rate, we had 4 people (not including myself) quit in the two years I worked there, and 2 of them didn't even make a full year. To give you an idea, there are only 9 staff members to begin with, so this can greatly hinder productivity and add new responsibilities to your plate while they search for a new person to fill the role. \r\n\r\n-I could write a book about everything that went on at this place during my time there but overall, if you are fresh out of college, with no experience, and are really struggling to get employment it'll get you by for a year or two until you can move on to something more in line with where you want to be. But if you are someone who is looking to work in mental health or psychology as a career, I'd highly recommend looking elsewhere for something more clinical as the format of this program is geared more toward education than mental health."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good place to work for overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Mental Health Therapist in Glendora, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, get clinical hours quickly, great clinical experience", "cons": "Big case loads, lots of billing"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good place to work pre-licensed", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Therapist in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "pay, flexibility, supervision, training opportunities, plenty of vacation and paid sick days", "cons": "case load, paperwork, hard population, severely mentally ill, home visits"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "just", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Lifeguard in Kennewick, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people who work here are fun.", "cons": "Sometimes there is a break down of communication from some of the managers."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not the best", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Therapist in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Own schedule.

The problem with this is that it is UNREALISTIC to complete our job tasks in the time given. We are not staff who are hanging around all day doing nothing. Client care is important to all of us and we make sure to meet our client's needs. Unfortunately, the way our offices and jobs are setup with many meetings, much administrative paperwork that can't be billed for, non user-friendly computer systems, and too much responsibility being put on line staff for things that are not billable, such as OMA's, the increasing amount of random forms required by either PC or DMH, and understanding of dense MEMO's from random EHIM, HR, or other upper level departments, it is nearly impossible to keep up. \r\n\r\nIt is well known that NEARLY ALL therapists and case managers take work home (whilst understanding there is an unspoken rule that they can't really openly express how often this needs to happen) to complete billing. Maybe if PC were more flexible with us to allow us telecommute days or other benefits, we could all be open about how to best get all the work done, but I feel like that use middle level management to shield themselves from the realities of the troubles that line staff face and they just put pressure on management to have us line staff either \"figure out a way\" to do it on our own, or get fired, or get so stressed out that staff leave."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "30 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great mission; great staff.
