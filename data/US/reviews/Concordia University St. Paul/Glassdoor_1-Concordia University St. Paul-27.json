The contract and part-time faculty are ignored and often talked down to as though we don't know what we are doing. They seem to be moving towards a for-profit model and moving most classes online, which are all 7-week courses . \n\nAll syllabi are being modularized with teaching freedoms removed - making individual experience and expertise unimportant. They try to suggest that we still have academic freedom to add uniqueness to the lectures, but those are all dictated to you, and we are not allowed to change anything within the syllabus or how blackboard is set up. The value of bringing decades of practical industry experience to teaching is not there. The changes are significant and being incorporated quicker. Many full-time faculty have responded to these changes by leaving - most within the last 6 months. You need to be a part of the \"in-group\" that is moving the University to this for-profit model, or you are pushed out through extreme micromanaging, marginalization and/or demotions. \n\nI've seen some talented faculty be broken down and replaced by younger, less insightful, and experienced faculty who won't challenge anyone. It's demotivating and concerning. I'm not sure how much longer I will keep teaching here. When you teach part-time, you do so because you want to help students learn what they need to know in the workplace, and you have critical insights as to what is required and why. There is no other motivation - as pay certainly isn't. Why would anyone teach part-time or as a contractor if we weren't truly dedicated to teaching students what they need to know? So with your doctorate, you can make less than $15/hr? We'd all make more money working at fast-food restaurants would likely experience far less micromanagement and endure fewer condescending conversations."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Excellent Employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Associate Vice-President in Saint Paul, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great environment and team spirit", "cons": "Very conservative culture can be prohibitive"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Team", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 May 2021", "job_title": "Conference & Event Services", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employees at the school form a tight knit community", "cons": "Low pay even if overqualified."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Math Tutor", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Stocker in Richfield, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Teach college math and review previous courses", "cons": "The schools online system regarding scheduling was labor some"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Does not feel like a university", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Saint Paul, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small campus with friendly faculty and staff.
