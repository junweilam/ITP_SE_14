They claim to have an open door policy and be against retaliation, but I never witnessed raising concerns there to be taken well. Leadership reactions have ranged from labeling those who\u2019d speak up as toxic, to actually firing people with no warning after they complained about documented problematic behavior from their supervisors.\n\nImpact: The value they embody least, in my opinion. From international regions going a year or more at a time without a Managing Director to funds being spent in petty ways like sending staffers in high ranking positions on unnecessary trips, or paying large sums to keep people from taking action after they\u2019ve fired them with no justification. From a donor\u2019s perspective, I don\u2019t think MFA is at all a good organization to support.\n\nIntegrity: One of the more troubling and unethical things I witnessed there was Leadership publicly encouraging all staff to write good reviews on Glassdoor to balance out how many negative ones there were at the time. Also, they claim they give credit when it\u2019s due, but for as long as I worked there, I noticed a deeply ingrained pattern of excluding qualified employees from being promoted. Instead, directive positions would go out to external applicants with a hustle mentality, who soon proved to have no insight into the organization\u2019s mission and only deteriorated what little progress was previously achieved.\n\nGlobal mindedness: I always perceived a colonialist-minded approach to org-wide work. International regions have never been autonomous, and I think it\u2019s very problematic how they tokenize the couple of staffers from the global majority in their public facing videos and yearly reports.\n\nInnovation: Is the one value I\u2019d say they arguably carry out to some extent, but as I said with global mindedness, they\u2019re determined to push a US-centric approach to all regions, regardless of whether it\u2019s culturally relevant or not.\n\nCollaboration: They pride themselves in approaching entities with different stands and values, but they systematically go out of their way not to do that within the organization. If you hold views that are at all different from Leadership, you\u2019re shut out. Historically, you only move up the ladder if you show nothing but praise, as constructive criticism and promotions are simply incompatible at MFA.\n\nIt\u2019s sad how much potential the organization has had throughout the years and how consistently they wear out people who could have been instrumental to significant change for animals.\nIn the end, I became one of the many who left the organization burned out and disappointed from not having been allowed to make a significant impact for animals killed for food."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- excellent and ethical executive leadership\n- loving and kind coworkers\n- incredible mission\n- understanding of work life balance and social justice importance to our work", "cons": "It's a nonprofit so there will never be enough staff to do all the things that need to be done."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Inclusive, Dedicated, Intentional Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Since joining Mercy For Animals, I have been impressed with the welcoming, inclusive culture.

Little did I know, this would set the tone for my remaining three years at Mercy For Animals.\n\nAt first, I was okay with constantly being understaffed and expected to always do things outside job description. However, as time went by, I realized and it is my opinion that this wasn't due to not having enough resources to fix things in my region (Mexico), it was a matter of constantly being an afterthought for the leadership team. It is my opinon that we had no real support from them, we were left to our own devices to come up with strategies for our region but without any real autonomy or proper budget to execute them. \n\nIf you don't care about the actual cause Mercy For Animals stands by, it might be a decent place to work at, based solely on salary and benefits, however, I had never experienced this amount of neglect and mistreatment from an employer. That's probably why there's a constant and considerable amount of staff rotation, which caused many key strategic roles to be empty in my region for the majority of my three years there. This rendered us stagnant and unable to do almost anything of actual value for the animals.\n\nLast year, things turned out to be even worse when my former team was introduced to the new manager, from the very beginning things were very rough. We were verbally told by her that we were expected to work late if she needed to, that we should stop complaining so much about culture and focus on working instead, she said that the things that we were doing weren't impactful or good enough based on just feelings or first impressions, she created a very hostile and unsafe environment for me and my colleagues, and she wouldn't take feedback possitively as retaliation was not uncommon.\n\nIt is my opinion and experience that concerns raised to HR and supervisors are always \"heard\" but at the same time, always disregarded. I never felt like real action was taken when raising concerns or giving feedback.\n\nIt is my opinion that the reason my former direct supervisor would get away with destroying team-morale, not following communication guidelines, forcing staff to share misleading, inflammatory posts on social media, embellishing metrics to make her look better and making classist and xenophobic remarks, is because for more than a year, we didn't have a Managing Director, and like expressed previously, I believe that leadership never really turned an eye to our region, and even if they did, I also believe that none of them really know Spanish good enough like to understand what's really going on.\n\nOne of my collegues would constantly be treated pretty badly by our former manager, and when we decided to speak to HR about this issue (yet again), a couple days later the both of us got fired. \n\nThey told me that the reason they were letting me go was that \"they could tell I wasn't happy working there anymore and that nobody likes working with someone who isn't happy\" I politely asked if this decision had anything to do with the situation going on with my manager at the time and if there were any other reasons for letting me go, since I never got a warning or any complaints, they told me that \"me not being happy at the workplace was more than enough to terminate my contract. \"\n\nBefore the virtual call ended I was already locked out from slack and my email. \n\nI was very upset by how things ended, I invested three years of my life working hard, giving my best ideas, while also trying to improve things at the organization, and at the end they didn't even gave me the chance to say goodbye, but what bothers me the most from this particular situation is that two key positions were yet again left empty, for no real reason, and they also had to pay a really big amount of money as indemnization for injustified firing according to Mexican law. I do not understand why they'd do that and \"waste\" money meant for the animals firing people like that, rather than actually make efforts to improve working conditions so people stop feeling unsafe, unhappy and burned out. \n\nAs of August 3rd of 2021, my former boss is still working at Mercy For Animals.\n\nI hope this message reaches someone thinking about working there and that you really consider other options until Mercy For Animals seriously works on these issues, this is particularly the case if you'll be working in a region that is not the United States. \n\nAs a final note, I remember a time where morale improved only for the US staff after they had their yearly national retreat, (pre-pandemic), after the fact, I saw HR asking through slack to leave positive reviews for MFA at Glassdoor. I believe they did this since they were flooded with negative reviews from the 30+ employees that resignated in a time span of less than year. I felt this is important to point out since I found that practice to be unethical and unprofessional.\n\nThank you for your time reading my review."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "workplace harassment, retaliation,", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Remote work\nPassionate coworkers\nOpportunity to help animals", "cons": "Supervisors without any ethical values or experience\nLack of core values\nMicromanagement"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Outstanding mission and culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good culture and mission, welcoming team, remote, good benefits.", "cons": "average pay, some turnover, starting pay on the low end."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "MFA is my happy place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is the best place to work in the animal rights movement and probably very good overall for the whole nonprofit sector.

Not only are senior leadership members earning high salaries, but they are giving themselves promotions and raises as they are laying off and demoting invaluable team members who were the heart of the organization. There are so many incredible, talented, and compassionate people who work for the organization, but they are being severely mismanaged by new faces who are completely disconnected from reality. Aside from lay offs, they are experiencing resignations left and right. MFA 3.0 is a mess. They created a guiding coalition to develop a 3-year strategy and basically interpreted staff suggestions the worst way possible and when people tried to speak up and give critical feedback, Leah (MFA's current president) and other senior leadership members responded by saying, \"this is the strategy you created, this is what you wanted.\" No, we did not want our beloved organization to be mismanaged into the ground.

Deliberate lack of transparency, outward as well as inward. High turnover, including at the leadership level. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 2019, eight team members were laid off. It was explained to staff that this was necessary due to a budget shortfall. Staff were denied raises, and the annual staff retreat was removed from the calendar. (Later in the year, however, the organization held an extravagant event that cost over half a million dollars.) \r\n\r\nSince the layoffs, over 45 additional team members have left the organization.

Those of us who remain are being told that turnover is \"in line with the industry average\".\r\n\r\nIn 2019, leadership instituted a new strategic plan. Since then, program areas have changed (some have disintegrated altogether), many programs have switched around, and no one can keep track of what the organization is even doing anymore. Meanwhile, there is talk of global expansion into Asia, despite the inexperience in those regions and the overall inability to keep staff retained anywhere.\r\n\r\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion are critical to the movement and to the health of this organization. Women, people of color, and LBGTQ team members make up the majority of the people who have left the organization, sadly. Meanwhile, those promoted into senior roles, especially at the upper levels, have all been white men. This organization is becoming less and less diverse, equitable and inclusive every day.\r\n\r\nThis organization is so important to the animal rights movement, and it is shameful what it has allowed itself to become.
