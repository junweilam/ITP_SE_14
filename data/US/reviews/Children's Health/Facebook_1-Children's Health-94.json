In a hospital, ironically, some managers will probably die from the stress this company puts on their employees in this way. They would actively promote men because their race when they had sexual harassment complaints filed against them repeatedly. It backwards and inefficient. At one point, in discussions with someone in billing, the company is wasting millions of dollars simply because they don't follow up with billing properly. The company is too top heavy - the executives make up almost 10% of the 10k people company.

He struggles to lower his nose enough to see the utter dissatisfaction that a good - I'd venture to say majority - percentage of his subjects, er, uh, I mean employees are experiencing in their roles.  This dissatisfaction is a result of four years of tremendous turnover at the upper-middle and senior management levels.  As a result, culture and tribal knowledge have suffered immensely.  While often times, new blood is needed to shake up an organization and bring in high-performers to move toward a culture of action and creativity, the result of the last four years of leadership recruitment at CMCD has been a disaster.  Most of the new leadership, with the exception of Population Health, have contributed to the exodus of top-producing talent, the fostering of a \"Fear Culture,\" and a feeling that the gig, no matter the tenure, is temporary.

It's almost enough aggravation to drive you mad!! Benefits have been cut over the past year and more cuts are coming.\r\n\r\nManagement puts a \"spin\" on everything. They have hired more communications people to help with marketing to different audiences, including internal.  However, if you read a story they wrote about your department or how great the organization is to employees, you would be shocked and not even recognize the place they are describing! It is amazing how selective they are in listening. They only hear what they want to hear, and you'd better only speak up if you agree.  Otherwise, keep your mouth shut and you might just be able to keep your job for a littel while longer.  Asking for honest feedback is a ploy, and they will retaliate if you speak up.\r\n\r\nManagement is not consistent in how they treat employees or problems, and speaking up can cost you. There are pockets of good management, and if you are fortunate enough to work in those areas, you will really enjoy your work and benefit from the leadership and mentoring you will receive. However, the environment created and tolerated by the senior leadership usually drives those good managers away eventually, which is disheartening to those hoping for positive change.\r\n\r\nUnless you are a nurse, expect your pay to be less than competitive. Perhaps they are counting on the mission to attract and keep you there. If you ask for a raise, you may be lumped into a category of someone who is \"driven by money\" and that is seen as negative and will hamper any advancement you were hoping for. Even HR leaders speak negatively of those who try to negotiate, provide a counter offer, or otherwise don't accept what you are given or told to do.\r\n\r\nProcesses are bureacratic and cumbersome.

Continuous back-stabbing and lying for their own advantages, at the detriment of the organization as a whole; especially the employees. The amount of financial waste that goes on daily is sickening and a case study in why health care cost are so incredibly high. I have personally seen millions spent on projects to literally have them immediately abandoned after they where completed. (Specifically IT systems) There is zero accountability for this waste and unfortunately the executives continue to give their stamp of approval on this type of activity as they reward those in control of these bad behaviors. The pure lack of profit and loss responsibilities/accountabilities is completely insane. There is a continued focus on how to squeeze more money out of state and federal reimbursements and how to create new lines of business, chasing pots of gold at the end of random rainbows, rather then focusing on how to make existing areas efficient and profitable. Children's is leading the way in terms of it's cost of services, it is among the highest in the nation.\r\n\r\nA lot of the issues are directly related to the a love hate relationship between the Doctors and the organization. The Doctors love to hate everything the hospital does and the hospital loves to cater to their every whim. If you have a facility that is open and staffed 40 hours a week and the doctors choose to only see patients 15-20 of those hours, well you can see the problem there. The executive leadership is so afraid of the Medical Staff and the relationship with UT Southwest that they will not do anything about it. Again, common sense says that you don't staff for the 40 hours of you find doctors that will work a full week seeing patients. The arrogance and god complex that 95% of these doctors have is ridiculous and has been left unchecked for far too long. \r\n\r\nThe business model of Healthcare is a broken and one could not expect Children's to not fall into some of the same traps that it's peers do. However, the continued directed this organization is going is only going to lead to it's ultimate demise; maybe this will be a good thing. It is a 100 year old organization and continues to run it's business like a 100 year old organization; old, slow, and inefficient. There are so many senior leaders that want to be like the perceived peer hospitals, but no one wants to do the hard work to get there. They want to spend their way to the top. \r\n\r\nBad behavior amongst the leadership is so common it almost appears it is taught at some level. There are leaders that continue to degrade, demoralize, and denigrate the employees day in and day out. When brought to HR's attention or even to simply their peers, it is overlooked or explained away in some manner. Employee engagement scores continue to indicate that the employees and senior leadership are not on the same page with the happiness and well being of it's employees. Most groups are short staffed and long hours are demanded from all. The idea is work life balance does not exist. There is often expectation that work continues well into the night each day after normal business hours are over. I do not shy away from hard work for the sake of getting to goal on a project or effort. However, the expectation is that you pull these types of hours 365 days out of year simply because. Everyone needs a good understanding of working smarter and not harder. Sadly enough, staying late and working weekends is talked about by everyone as some sort of badge of honor. \r\n\r\nThe senior leadership operates as some sort of oligarchical dystopia society. The rich get richer and the peasant employees must do as their kinds tell them. There are no open doors to senior leaders. If you interact with them, do so only if you have first been spoken to. Then act as if they are better then everyone under them.
