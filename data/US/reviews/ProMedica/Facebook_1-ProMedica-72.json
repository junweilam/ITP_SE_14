You can get fired for calling off too much or being a bully but not for acting like you're brand new even if you've worked there many years or are just plain lazy.", "cons": "Wages and shift differentials are NOT competitive. Literally can go to any other hospital and get paid more hourly with better shift diff. Yearly col increase doesn't match or even try to compete with inflation. No incentive for senior staff to stay and 401k match only pays out yearly as a lump sum if you work there the ENTIRE year. \n\nHealth insurance benefits are tethered to Promedica network ONLY. If you live outside of network local providers are not covered out of \"convenience\" to your location (so you have to travel 30-60 mins to see someone in network). \n\nPromedica owns Paramount insurance and yet cost, deductibles, oop go up every year for crappier coverage. \n\nMid management is constantly being restructured leaving less people to do more work, this trickles down to charge nurses and other staff looking to earn points for an extra $1-2/hr. Mid management are usually scapegoats for a lot of things but I've seen terrible managers stay and great managers leave.\n\nIf you're a nurse on night shift plan on taking out your own trash, dirty linen, restocking your servers and being limited on supplies, especially on the weekends. Good luck finding pillow cases on a Sunday night.\n\nOh and I hope you trust your coworkers to watch your other patient(s) while you play transport and run to CT, MRI, x-ray, OR, IR, etc in the middle of the night for stat tests and procedures. I say this because when they're short all the charge nurses have a full patient load and are just as busy as everyone else (remember when I said more work for less people above?).\n\nA ton of admitting providers aren't in house overnight so good luck getting anyone to come in to take care of anything critical. The ones that are in house have an obscene amount of patients to cover. You are expected to place all the phone and verbal orders, talk to patients and their families about critical illnesses (visitors can be there 24/7 in some areas), answer questions, provide rationales and educate, discuss code status, communicate with all other departments any issues or barriers to delays, take care of your other patients properly and get out on time. \n\nEVERYTHING IS THE NURSE'S JOB. And if you don't get it done it's your fault. Anything you didn't do or wasn't up to par according to management you'll get the classic \"what could you have done better to NOT make John Doe throw his urinal at you before he left AMA.\"\n\nOrganization as a whole is very reactive and not proactive. Policies and procedures don't change very often unless something happens to facilitate change. Very much still run like a community hospital with a mediocre academic affiliation. Everything is someone else's problem when it comes to providers. No one wants to own their patient's problems and good luck getting anyone to agree on a treatment plan from shift to shift, day to day and week to week. If I had a dollar for every time a physician on call told me \"I'm just covering tonight this is so and so's patient\" but not really own the problem, I'd be very rich. \n\nPromedica umbrella is a sham because of this. Nothing is streamlined, individual departments and hospitals basically do what they want in regards to what supplies they use, how they run their weekend and holiday rotations, how they treat their staff, and what providers can admit to the hospital because that's the way things have always been done.
