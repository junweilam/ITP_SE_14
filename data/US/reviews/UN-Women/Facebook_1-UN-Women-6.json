Great grass-roots level work.\r\n\r\nExtremely cushy UN salary (junior/starting level makes about 70k net in NYC) plus very generous benefits  (housing allowance (up to 1k a month), 30 days paid leave, maternity, paternity, health, child education allowance (up too 30k per year per kid), 30k relocation, paid tickets to fly home with the whole family every other year, etc, but only for the small portion of the workforce in international (P and D) staff positions.\r\n\r\nLittle expected results and weak management oversight or enforcement: great for chronic slackers and over-the-hill bureaucrats who just want to cash in while traveling around on the corporate dime and waiting for retirement. Really perfect if you are politically or personally connected with management and want to pursue a side gig of finish up that part-time PhD while on the UN payroll.\r\n\r\nSolid work/life balance if you're a slacker.
