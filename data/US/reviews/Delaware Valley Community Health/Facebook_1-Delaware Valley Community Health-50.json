I needed something to do so I got a job doing data entry for programs at DVCH. Eventually worked at the front desk and then moved into the Billing Department where I hit my stride. I was a Billing Clerk, Billing Team Leader, Billing Manager, Director of Billing and today Senior Director of Revenue Cycle Management, this took over 25 years. I was fortunate to find a leader that influenced me to strive to be better as an employee and an individual and as the organization grew, I got to grow with it. Also, I continue to learn, which is important to me. One of the most exciting parts of my job is using what I have learned over the years and applying to the continuing changing healthcare finance/billing world. Embracing technology has always been a passion of mine and at DVCH they welcome new ideas that can improve process.\r\nOne of the most impressive parts of my job is what I do helps support the DVCH mission, caring for their communities health, check it out www.dvch.org for a business to care so much about its patients and staff is unbelievable.
