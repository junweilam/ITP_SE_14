I worked there nearly three years and we reorganized twice. Many co-workers were dismissed without warning, even when doing a good job. They would just disappear. \r\nManagement was set up in a way that there was a layer cake: middle management was pulled in the ever-changing direction of upper management. Upper management was more focused on looking good than doing good work, which is what the staff was concerned with.\r\nWith literally 50 different goals, coordinating large teams was hard as well. We had no infrastructure support, no databases internally, yet worked with exterior consultants that were paid gobs more than we were to tell management what we were saying all along. It was a comical error of overusing cheap tools (like Office, instead of analysis tools that the industry uses) by throwing bodies at it, all the while paying people externally, so we can be perceived as being frugal (because external contracts aren't 'administration overhead'). Penny wise: pound foolish.\r\nWe also had so many meetings, because I was on 8 distinct initiative teams, that performing became difficult. \r\nInternal upward mobility was only relegated for the politically savvy darlings. And even then, they were axed without warning. A few competent people could make an impact, but then they were dismissed without explanation as well. \r\nCertain personalities dominated the toxic politics of the office and became local deities. \r\nI don't know what it takes to be successful there. But I gave it my all for a 25% pay cut to work within my scope of values. Simply put, I was exploited and cast aside. Management continues to blame the victims of their insufficient processes and tone deaf policy. Morale swings between prison camp and the Titanic, post-iceberg.\r\nBy the end of my tenure, and after my third poor on-paper/official annual review (they did that to save money and not give you a raise), I was told that I was no longer welcome. \r\nI was devastated and had little self confidence. It's only now that I realize that it wasn't me. It was them. I'm a fantastic worker and highly desired now, and have worked in very prestigious positions. I just didn't fit in their culture of turfy layer cake.\r\nAt least I have some genuine friends out of the deal."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great and impactful job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent co-workers, collaborative culture, mission-based work, great benefits, investment in employees professional development", "cons": "Flat organizational structure limits upward mobility, process-driven management structure doesn't allow for as much nimble and adaptive management as is required in rapidly changing industry"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Has promise", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Oct 2012", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing work - groundbreaking, respected internationally, very respected organization", "cons": "Sr. management turmoil and lack of leadership from both sr. team and the Board is contributing to low morale and high stress."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Sr Program Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Senior Program Manager in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great cause in energy efficiency, interesting work, great colleagues.", "cons": "Poor leadership and lack of teamwork at director level."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great team to work for as contractor", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Contractor, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 May 2015", "job_title": "Research Consultant in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Collaborative approach to working with contractors\r\nMission driven\r\nClear, effective communications\r\nHigh expectations with the support to help you meet them\r\nFulfilled contractual obligations efficiently", "cons": "Industry-wide politics and bureaucracy can stall projects"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Important work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 May 2020", "job_title": "Manager in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is onboard with the overall company mission.", "cons": "Your ability to move to other positions in the company is very much determined by your hiring manager."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Quality Staff Exiting", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, flexible schedule, smart employees", "cons": "Non-strategic leadership, strange culture, soooo many meetings"}]]
