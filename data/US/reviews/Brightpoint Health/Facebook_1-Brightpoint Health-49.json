Primary Care Providers have become secondary to Business Development. Despite being an FQHC, few residents from the surrounding community are actually served. Business Development busses in new residents of homeless shelters that the Agency has a contract with to obtain physical exams and psychiatric evaluations as required by the shelters. While this raises the number of new patients served, existing patients suffer in contrast. Patients are double and triple booked and walk in\u2019s are encouraged resulting in extensive waiting times to see providers. Referrals to specialists take an exhorbitant amount of time to complete and providers frequently see a patient for a follow up before that patient even has an appointment with the specialist. Electronic prescriptions are routinely sent to the wrong pharmacy or not sent at all. The Agency\u2019s ADHC day Program has been expanded to include a broader range of clients to increase quantity. Primary Care providers are regularly reminded of the need to minimize time with patients. As for new patients, insurance eligibility is first checked at the reception desk upon arrival rather than before. Patients for mental health providers routinely show without the needed referral or are already in treatment at another facility and are brought in by Business Development solely to increase the number of patients served. All this results in a very stressed, inefficient, chaotic work environment where front desk personnel and laboratory med techs take the brunt of the anger; yelling, screaming, and cursing from the patients. Staff burnout and turnover is high. Lunch is 30 minutes if you can actually take it  since providers are required to see every patient on their schedule scheduled prior to their  lunch break time including same day walk ins. 3 years without a raise or evaluation. Recently, a merit raise was allegedly given but it appears to have been nothing more than a 2% across the board increase with no recognition for quality of work performed or dedication to the company.
