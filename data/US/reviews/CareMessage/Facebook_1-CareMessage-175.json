It feels good to know that our hard work goes toward helping real people, and often the people most in need of help. Coming into work each day is easy when you know the impact you're having on real lives.\r\n\r\nThe team here is hard-working, thoughtful, and mature. We trust each other, and that shows in the support and thoughtfulness around the strong remote-work culture. The team is still relatively small and growing at the right pace, and we stretch ourselves to achieve big results.\r\n\r\nI admire the senior leadership's care and concern they have for all aspects of the business, whether it is culture, employee happiness and growth, managing a healthy budget, or building the best product possible. We have already implemented solutions or are thinking ahead about the problems that arise as a company scales, and it's good to see the thoughtfulness there. The business itself is very healthy with good growth, strong customer retainment, and a solid balance sheet. We also have a supportive, experienced, compassionate Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nFor my own role, I have never felt quite as empowered, trusted, and supported, and I feel as if I'm relishing in that and growing all the time. We worked hard on ensuring a good alignment before I joined, and that has paid off in the time I've been here.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, the compensation is on the generous side of fair, the office benefits are satisfactory in the general tech world and excellent when looking at the broader job market (we are technically a non-profit, so are judicial with our funds), the work-life balance is healthy, the office is spacious and comfortable and in an amazing location.", "cons": "I don't have many cons to say, so these are a bit of a reach, but I would note that the office can feel a bit quiet at times with several employees being remote-based and other folks being rather heads-down and focused on work, and perhaps slightly introverted. I do think this will continue changing as we hire more people and the energy livens up a bit. This may not be a \"con\" as it's easy to focus, but at times I do crave a bit more of a buzz and interpersonal engagement around the office \u2014 of course, we can all do our part to improve this, including me.\r\n\r\nWe have a few talent gaps in the team currently, but are working on filling them actively. This shows as a \"con\" in the meantime as some folks are spread a bit thin, but the company does recognize that and is working to address it.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are technically a non-profit, which has certain limitations (e.g. there are no stock option incentives).

The lack comes from the top down.  There is a lack of leadership, a lack of communication, and a lack of culture. This is just the beginning of where the lack begins. However, there is not a lack of ego, narcissism, and immaturity that blankets the culture of CM like a cheap blanket. The executive team consists of a clique of several bodies with one head.  It is this narrow, shared group thought that will be the ultimately be the downfall of CareMessage.  With that being said, everyone on the executive team knows their part and how to play the role. Do not say too much or disagree with the founder or co-founder. When the company knowledge is limited to a few key players there is no room for growth and development and eventual failure. \r\n\r\nThe mission of CM is \u201cCareMessage is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to empower healthcare organizations with mobile technologies to improve health outcomes and reduce the cost of care.\u201d  CareMessage has prided itself on its mission and vision. CM uses this to pull on the heartstrings of its customers, donors, philanthropist, and employees. \r\n\r\nThis mission is what has and continues to bring potential employees in for interviews.

The \u201cWHY\u201d is very important and can save you a lot of wasted time, energy, anger, frustration, disappointment, but most importantly your sanity and sense of self.  If you believe in the mission and the story CareMessage tells I understand why this may have you considering CM as a viable work option.  However, you may be one of the few (everyone else has left or been fired) who truly understand and believe in the mission including the founder and co-founder. If it is the warm and fuzzy pictures on Glassdoor do not be fooled. Be sure to ask in your interview how many of those people are still employees of CareMessage.  \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a paycheck with an opportunity to learn what not to do come on board. In addition, you will receive no professional development, recognition, or opportunity to grow.  Sorry, those positions are already filled. \r\n\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n1.    Remote friendly.

They are not open to feedback and fire or punish people who disagree with them or voice opinions contrary to theirs. Most managers and directors lack management experience and are sycophantic. Other people in senior executive positions who may be more experienced are there only because they don\u2019t challenge upper management.\r\n-In my experience, promotions aren\u2019t based on past results and performance, but on how well you are liked by upper management (i.e., if you are their friend or don\u2019t disagree with them.)\r\n-Fluid staffing structure and changes are understandable given that CareMessage is a startup, but, when I was there, there was a high turnover rate that was not adequately addressed by executive leads or managers. This lead to way too frequent team restructuring, rushed organizational changes and low employee morale.\r\n-Harsh firing practices and lack of transparency in hiring pipeline.\r\n-Upper management tries to make up for toxic culture with perks such as snacks, catered food, and team events that almost nobody wants to go to. A good dose of acknowledgement and empathy will go a far longer way than all those perks combined.\r\n-Lack of clear company vision due to zero leadership from CEO. When I was there, the direction of the company changed every quarter.\r\n-In my opinion, the company has lost touch with its mission by heavily pushing for profits in an effort to become \u2018self-sustained.\u2019 \r\n\r\nFor me, the flexible work arrangement and possibility of working remotely were by far the best things about working in CareMessage. The noble inspiration of working for a mission-driven company dissipated once I realized that people who are running the company are so arrogant and self-absorbed that they cannot truly embody the empathy required to help improve people\u2019s health, which is a the core of the organization\u2019s mission. This is such a shame because I truly enjoyed the work that I did there.\r\n\r\nThis disillusionment also carried through when I witnessed the leadership\u2019s lack of empathy for employees. For the most part, employees are considered to be expenses rather than assets, and there is little concern for their well-being. If someone is liked (and by that I mean they are friendly with the bosses) they are rewarded and praised; if they aren\u2019t liked for whatever reason, probably having nothing to do with work performance, they are disparaged and criticized. Experiencing any kind of satisfaction while working there, in my experience, is only an option when not speaking up against the broken culture and management style; not bringing up innovative ideas or making decisions within one\u2019s scope that upper management doesn\u2019t approve of first; and staying away from the mess as much as possible (if at all possible)."}], [], []]
