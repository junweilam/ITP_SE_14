They understand that during midterms and finals you might need time off. \r\n- If you've completed all your assigned tasks, you can do your homework.\r\n- Skills are very applicable to any full-time job, especially organization, customer service, managing a front desk, minute-taking, and multi-tasking. You could easily translate the experience to an office assistant role. \r\n- You learn a lot about the different resources on campus, sometimes ones that you never knew about before. \r\n- The office functions on the school's schedule, so you're not required to work on Spring Break, Winter Break, etc. but you still have the option. \r\n- Opportunities to go to workshops that benefit your career. I was able to attend a workshop about LinkedIn during my work time.\r\n- Sometimes you get free leftover food from events going on in the SU.", "cons": "- There may be times where you're alone in the office.
