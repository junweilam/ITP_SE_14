Clinica Sierra Vista was once a standing pillar in the central\r\nvalley providing health care to under-resourced communities; recently, it has fallen into\r\ndisarray and chaos. The organization is rampant with nepotism, favoritism, and sexual affairs\r\namong leaders. A severe lack of transparency exists in hiring and promotion practices. Equity is not something that exists or is valued in the organization, as employees are not given a fair chance at opportunities for promotion. There have been several instances where executive leaders have been promoted based on loyalty and not competence. This happens at all levels of the organization. The organization is currently being led by Olga Meave, who used to be the CMO, and Oscar Fletes, the previous director of General Services, now the Chief Operating Officer. Both leaders lack the experience and the competencies required to create a healthy, thriving organization that values shared governance and employees. They have alienated other executive leaders and are relying on short-sighted unilateral decisions that dramatically and negatively impact the organization. Their poor decision-making and authoritarian leadership style lead to high attrition, dissatisfaction, and disengagement of employees at all levels of the organization. Most notably, long-time executives, leaders, and employees have either resigned or have been laid off under the pretense of budgetary constraints imbued by the toxic work culture they perpetuate and lead. Everyone fears they will be retaliated against for speaking up against poor decision-making and unethical practices. Leaders who dare speak out are pushed out of the organization. They have zero self-awareness and refuse to take any accountability for the negative impact that they have caused the organization. In their quest for power, they have destroyed many people\u2019s livelihoods without thinking of the chaos left in their wake. They say they value the patient population, yet both lack the lived experiences and empathy to honestly care for the people served by the organization both internally and externally. They are wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing.\r\nUnfortunately, because they are willing to push out whoever disagrees with them, many people\r\nfear speaking up. This has created a work environment where employees throw each other under the bus to protect their jobs, a classic symptom of toxic leadership. Clinica Sierra Vista is no longer an organization that values employees or patients. It\u2019s Board of Directors, lacks leadership, understanding, and business acumen, which further compounds the behaviors of leaders like Olga Meave and Oscar Fletes. If you want to work at an organization that places blame on everyone else, this is the place for you. If you want to work for an organization that coerces its employees into submission, this is the place for you. If you want to work for an organization where you don\u2019t know who you can trust, this is the place for you. If you want to work for an organization driven by self-fulfillment rather than improving the communities they serve, this is the place for you. If you want to work for an organization where you will be lied to this is the place for you. \r\n\r\nThe reputation of this organization in the community is poor as it should be. The turnover rate\r\nhovers around 28%+, which should tell you what you need to know. If you are considering accepting a job here, DON\u2019T! They have recruited employees only to eliminate their roles shortly after they started and have misled many employees about what their roles would be. Save yourself the torture, do not come and work for this organization. There are plenty of other Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in the central valley where you will be treated better. You have options, don\u2019t settle for this mediocre place. The organization had so much potential; unfortunately, incompetent leaders have been promoted who care more about themselves.
