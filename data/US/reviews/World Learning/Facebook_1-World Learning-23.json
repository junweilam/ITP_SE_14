Overall, I found that working at World Learning was a solid way to get my foot in the door in the international NGO field and develop valuable professional experience.", "cons": "Having moved to a new company with transparent, non-hierarchical communication, supportive and friendly management, highly effective onboarding and training processes, and room for internal mobility, I feel like leaving World Learning was akin to leaving a toxic relationship.\r\n\r\nAs many others have said, your experience at World Learning significantly depends on your team and your manager. Unfortunately, I found my team environment to be quite toxic. My managers did not advocate for me and misinformed me about company policy regarding promotions/raises and taking time off. On an interpersonal level, I found that my managers were often belittling, undermining, and insincere. Frustration from overwork or disorganization was clearly channeled downward. Half of my team left in less than six months this past year due to the extreme lack of opportunity for growth, limited mobility, and low pay. The management structure seems to reward those who discourage employees under them from seeking advancement and opportunities, and push out those who attempt to rock the boat. The lack of transparency from the top down and hierarchical communication structure makes it incredibly difficult to navigate this organization and sometimes even inhibits your ability to work efficiently. Having to go through very specific communication channels to make a request or ask a question about policy (your supervisor forwards your inquiry to their supervisor and so forth), feels very disempowering (my rank is too low to ask the right person this question?) and once again, limits transparency by excluding you from these conversations that directly concern you. In general, my department seemed to promote a culture of fear around contacting HR directly with questions about company policy or position advancement, allowing management to shut down any requests open discussion about these topics.\r\n\r\nTalking to colleagues from outside of my team, we found disturbing pay/annual raise discrepancies between us. There was little consistency or reasonable explanation for these discrepancies between the same positions on different teams, and no transparency for the process of receiving a promotion (or rejection for that matter). \r\n\r\nI never felt like I was properly trained to do my job. Although I eventually learned to do my job well, I was really left to sink or swim from the beginning, causing a lot of unnecessary stress. I felt like I was inconveniencing others by asking for help. I also found, shockingly, that some tasks or responsibilities I was assigned, no one else on my team had institutional knowledge of how to do, largely due to high turnover and routine brain drain, leaving me to spend significant amount of time figuring out these processes from scratch. Most alarmingly, I felt that the lack of consistent training and standardized processes left gaps regarding privacy and confidentiality of our clients, as well as general client care. I felt like my lack of official training in these areas was a huge disservice to our clients.\r\n\r\nDiversity & Inclusion is woefully underprioritized at World Learning. Talk of diversity and inclusion was very often reactive rather than proactive, with little transparency around efforts to improve or institutions/resources in place to encourage Diversity & Inclusion. This is critically important for an international NGO in the 21st century, especially one that has been known to underserve staff members of color and promote white saviorism abroad in the past.\r\n\r\nAs others have pointed out, the rollback of benefits due to COVID-19 was disruptive and, once again, not transparent. Our annual cost of living adjustment was cancelled for two year in a row, vacation time rollover was cancelled, professional development funds were suspended, and 403b matching was cancelled. At first, the latter two expenses being cancelled made sense due to the massive loss of income, but after finances were (supposedly) stabilized and our benefits were not reinstated, it felt like a prolonged excuse not to give us vacation time or cost of living adjustment without an honest explanation.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that most of the positive reviews of this organization in the last year are from middle or upper management, including new hires. I've found this laughably insincere and believe this illustrates the dishonesty in management at World Learning.\r\n\r\nIn summary, depending on the team you join, working for World Learning may be worth it if you're just looking to get your foot in the door, but make sure to having an escape plan in mind if you find yourself in a situation similar to mine."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Stuck in a cycle of leadership transition and instability", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager in Brattleboro, VT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "inspiring co-workers. programs are great for participants and those of us that work on them.", "cons": "Leadership has gone through multiple transitions over the last few years.

World Learning does pay more than their competitors and what they can't pay in higher salary or Cadillac benefits, they make up for in work/life balance and culture where they can. One con is that this can be limited based on your manager, though they try to make most flexibility standard across programs/teams/managers. If you bring up any issues in this area, leadership will listen and try to institute fair policies though, like any organization, it can seem slow moving.\r\n\r\nYour job satisfaction can depend on your manager, like any organization there were a few colleagues I knew having a hard time because of who their manager was or because of which project they worked on. If it was a project issue, those colleagues made lateral moves to other departments/projects as new funding is always coming in and opportunities open up. If dissatisfaction was manager-based, colleagues often did the same - moved laterally to new teams or projects.
