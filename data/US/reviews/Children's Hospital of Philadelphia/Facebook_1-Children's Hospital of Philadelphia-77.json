I cannot speak for EVERY department there as it is a huge institution; I can only tell you what my particular department was like.  I am reaching to find a word that could even come close to describing the utter insanity, incompetence and abuse that went on with the higher level of management in my department.  People were hired without the specific experience/background they needed in order to be effective in their leadership positions, but their abuse of power was rampant.  Employees were randomly targeted and SEVERELY mistreated.  Hard-working staff was treated degradingly and condescendingly; pummeled with workloads that were not humanly possible to complete; harrassed by non-stop emails and other communication; and never given praise or appreciation for outstanding efforts, or rewarded with well-earned raises.  There was no place for home-work balance whatsoever; long hours were expected.  There seems to be no recourse for any of this, either, as everything at CHOP is highly political, and Human Resources is completely ineffective and bureaucratic.

I had to continually push for them to step up and do their jobs in the HR department and was given no choice as to my next position.

I have been lied to several times about salary increases and have been given ten times more work and biohazard jobs that I never agreed to for less pay than was initially indicated for my first position. CHOP receives a large amount of money from researchers, so their behavior is basically unmonitored and they go unpunished for illegal actions.

I had multiple competing offers at the time I interviewed and was recruited here with promises of promotions and opportunities to write grants; none of this materialized. From the door at orientation, scientific researchers aren't treated as though they're a part of CHOP. I've worked at many research hospitals before and never felt like this. If the PI you work for becomes abusive, there is no recourse (and this happens often-- many postdocs at CHOP, like most R1 institutes, seem to be H1B visa holders who are dependent on their PIs' good graces to stay in the country. PIs thus have total control; this can lead to an abusive climate towards all postdocs if left unchecked, and PI power is totally unchecked at CHOP). HR is utterly nonresponsive to scientific staff and CHOP neither offers nor encourages any mentoring, career guidance, or professional training opportunities outside of your PI. PIs don't seem to be given any basic management training either, and are allowed to lay off postdocs at will so there is always the threat of that regardless of your prior performance. As a woman, CHOP was also a terrible environment-- for instance, my PI constantly asked me about when/if I had plans to get pregnant and about other private matters. HR does nothing. I was promised a good work/life balance when I interviewed but after a few months, a consistent theme of my meetings with my PI was his frustration and disappointment that I was not working 80+ hours a week (without being paid any overtime, of course). I am a parent, so this is not possible. Furthermore, professionally, working those hours would have done nothing for my own career since I was treated like a tech to work on my PI's random ideas and grants-- rather than anything that would have furthered my own career. My PI also had major issues with my using my sick days when my young child became ill-- not something you might expect from a children's hospital? But presenteeism is part of the culture; quality of work and overall productivity is not taken into the equation. I wish I could go back in time; it was career suicide to come here, and I can't think of any postdoc at CHOP for whom it wouldn't be, given the absolute power PIs are given at CHOP, combined with the lack of mentoring and human resources."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Senior Certified Nursing Assistant in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I liked working the  Children and some people .", "cons": "Unfair Management ,but i Liked my Supervisor very much !"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not what I expected", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Mar 2016", "job_title": "RPH in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You are thoroughly trained and have many resources to work with.
