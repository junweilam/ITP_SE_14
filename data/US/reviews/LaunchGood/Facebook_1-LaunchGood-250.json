These women are admirable and accomplished, and bring a specific insight to business that I have not experienced in a work place before. The entire leadership team are people I admire for different reasons, and those specific reasons are woven into their everyday interactions with our whole team. Our team members are valued and respected by leadership, and the environment they have created includes making sure we team members are a part of every step of the LaunchGood process. \n\nWhile LaunchGood is definitely a faith based organization, we have team members who are not Muslim. Why is this important? Because what they can relate to are LaunchGood's values that are at the forefront of everything we do. It's not about religion, it's about a code that we all live by in our personal lives that we can bring to work every, single day. Doing good and helping people in need are universal concepts that each team members holds dear to their heart. \n\nPerhaps the most important thing to me about working at LaunchGood is how we have the freedom and flexibility to live our lives in an organic way. I do work 9-5 but when there are things that I need to get done during the day that have nothing to do with work, I have the support and trust from my team to let me manage my schedule in a way that provides great work-life balance.
