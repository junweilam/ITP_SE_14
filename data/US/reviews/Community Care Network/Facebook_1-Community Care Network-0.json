If you want to work in mental health this is the place for you to grow. I look forward to training you! Note: My 5 star experience at CCN may not the norm as I am in a niche IT position in administration. I am also a glass 1/2 full optimist. Find the good.

This is a nonprofit, and nonprofit work is demanding in a different way than for profit work. While CCN is a big organization, staff here do a lot of plate spinning and admin staff especially wear a lot of hats. The to-do lists can get long and overwhelming, and it can be difficult to prioritize things because when your work directly involves the well-being of people, EVERYTHING feels like a priority. And, often, various programs are often scrambling to solve a problem ASAP. It helps to have good expectation management and boundary-setting skills. If you don't, the project pile-on is nonstop and you'll get burnt out very quickly. If you have experience working with non-profits, this will come as no surprise to you. if you dont' have this experience, it can be a bit of an adjustment."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor health care and staff", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Registration in Portage, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One welcoming and kind front desk employee", "cons": "Horrible staff and medical care"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Board Certified Behavior Analyst Bcba in Rutland, VT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great management and mentorship.
