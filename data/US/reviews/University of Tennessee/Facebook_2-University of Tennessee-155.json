Clearly, not every administrator is this way, but there are some extraordinarily slimy characters working at UTK.\r\n\r\nI have personally experienced  racism, ethnocentrism and sexism (a surprising amount is overt, a lot of it is subtle and much is structural in nature) and I have experienced the place as having a highly intolerant climate. In my opinion, there is denial about the climate by central administration who, from my perspective, is given to issuing lofty platitudes publicly, while enabling and supporting bad behavior and bad managers privately.\r\n\r\nI have experienced and observe a lot of conniving, back-biting, favoritism, nepotism, cronyism, unfairness, pettiness, lying and deceitful behavior. I am surprised at how much of this behavior there is.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the city of Knoxville, where UTK is located, contributes to its culture of intolerance and bigotry. Knoxville is not a good place to live as far as I am concerned - it is very \"old South\" (and not in the charming way).  I don't feel safe here.  \r\n\r\nIn Tennessee, where UTK is located, there is no tax on wages, but sales tax is very high and even food is taxed  which results in a regressive tax structure in the state - it is more expensive than it seems to live in Knoxville, especially if you don't make much money.  Many salaries at UTK are low. If you are considering moving to UTK, be careful about the kind of counsel that you receive when it comes to the actual cost of living. Don't be deceived by the line, \"but there's no state tax to worry about!\" -especially if you get offered what you think is a low salary.\r\n\r\nIn my  opinion, staff are not treated as well as they should be and I have witnessed staff (and even faculty) being constantly bullied and oppressed by other faculty and administrators; there is a lot of quiet desperation and people will tell you terrible stories about their experiences (off the record) if you get to know them and they trust you. People are afraid to speak up when wrongs happen.  Most people seem to look the other way when something bad happens or quietly be happy that it didn't happen to them (this time...)\r\n\r\nI don't see that central administration is concerned with the issues confronting regular people in the state even though it is a land grant university. Central administration appears obsessed with rising in national rankings, but not with activities that help people in the state enhance or improve their lives. In my opinion, central administration panders to the state legislature without offering real suggestions as to how higher education can improve everyone's quality of life. UTK is not unique in this, but TN is not a wealthy enough state to waste resources on chasing rankings that only serve to improve senior administrator pay."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Graduate research", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Knoxville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very flexible and friendly working environment \nInterdisciplinary research opportunities.
