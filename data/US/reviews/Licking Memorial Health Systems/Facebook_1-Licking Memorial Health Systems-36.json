When you are coughing and throwing up you do not need to be anywhere near food service which is where I was. how can an organization condone that employees should come to work sick then handle and prepare food for patients that are already there with health problems,  absolutely horrid this hospital shouldn't even be permitted to run horrible business and health practices. Managers and supervisors will take the first chance they can to undermine you and make you look bad when something goes wrong,  human resources are worse than debt sharks I sent in a letter of appeal to appeal my termination because I felt it was best that I shouldn't spread infection within the hospital especially handling food and their response letter was that I should have come to work that that was not an excuse to call off of work so clearly this hospitals priorities are completly about money instead of saving and improving lives. This hospital got an award for one of the best places to work in the US I have a good feeling that some money was thrown around under the table to obtain this award because any business that legitimately gets this award doesn't do that to their employees."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Love my job.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Certified Medical Assistant in Newark, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is friendly and seems to enjoy their work.", "cons": "Some upper management do not pay attention to all their employees."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Traditional Work Place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Network Administrator in Newark, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good beneifts, worklife balance, and good comradery amongst teams", "cons": "No raises based on merit only on how many years you've been there. \r\nNo clear path to grow and get promoted"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Tremendous compensation and supportive work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Staff Pharmacist in Newark, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Yearly raises and bonuses\r\nHealth insurance very inexpensive", "cons": "Nepotism\r\nLack of consistency in dealing with discipline"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Staff RN in Fairfield, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fair, great management, decent staffing, good benefits", "cons": "Short staffing on an ongoing basis"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good Luck", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Point of Care Technician in Newark, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good food, small hospital, good doctors", "cons": "People love to gossip, management never listens/cares"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great friendly Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Point of Care Tech in Newark, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance, Great people -
