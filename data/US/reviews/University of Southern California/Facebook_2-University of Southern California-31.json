Postdocs with the same teaching load get $65k, no annual increases, no benefits, unpaid maternity or family leave, no retirement plan matching. As a postdoc, you are neither treated as a staff nor faculty - postdoc is a separate cathegory. You still must perform some duties of the faculty (you can be asked to be on a committee, to supervise a senior project, to supply questions to qualifying exams) but you have neither benefits of being a faculty nor job stability of those. Finally, the salary. The minimum wage for except workers in LA county in 2022 is $62,400 per year. USC pays you just $65,000 per year (and it doesn't even give you some basic things like 5% retirement plan matching, something that you would get in almost any other job).

The 18 schools within the university compete against each other for student tuition revenue, which stifles collaboration and gives the place a siloed atmosphere. The bureaucracy is very slow and inefficient. This is mostly due to the failure of the administration to hire more staff in positions that are actually needed and to their propensity to hire other people in positions that make the university look good on paper. The vision of the administration is politically ideological, opportunistic, and in constant change according to the political climate of the day. This is a very greedy university and the goals are very budget-driven. Recent scandals have prompted some changes at the top, but a major remaining problem is that the board of trustees and the president have decided long ago to run the place like a corporation.

Imminent threats of layoffs and restructuring continually present creating tense and stressful work environment with low morale.

The fact that he is overworked and not given enough resources for the lab by the school worsens this.

Well, there is no guarantee on summer pay (and in the future this is looking like there'll be no guarantee on annual stipend renewal either). I got unlucky and had to pull teeth with my advisor to provide (at times no, at times half, and one lucky time full) summer funding. There is seemingly no push for faculty to bring in grant money. In my department, we had about 2-3 professors with funding, leaving nearly all PhD students to fend for themselves during the summers. Overall, the campus culture is every (wo)man for themselves, and it's extremely hard to build relationships with staff or faculty. I blame this on each department and office being so cramped up into the tiniest of spaces and often also broken up across different buildings relatively far from each other. Almost everyone who worked in my department felt lonely. Some thrived in that but most just put up with it. In 5 years, there was one admin position that went through 4 different people. People just kept leaving. If you're a PhD candidate, most people still treat you like an undergrad. As a TA, I got only a few hours of petagogic training before I embarked on a 5+ year journey teaching every semester. There was no accountability and no interest for our work as TAs. All TAs for all classes shared 1 office with 4 desks, rotating through. A lot of people work remotely to compensate for a miserable (amount of) space they're given on campus. Really, I spent most of my time unable to enjoy work and intellectual freedom and teaching here. I expected a very different experience off the sales pitch I got before applying. USC is not the private school environment that puts the student first. It really feels more like UCLA with pretty classrooms. If you want to build real relationships with students, I recommend going anywhere else at this point. I felt unable to give back the experience I had in undergrad because every effort felt like throwing time into a void. No one cared either way, not students, not faculty, not admins."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Fragmented IT structure, minimal centralized IT leadership, poor innovation", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Information Technology (IT) in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent perks/benefits.

In the meantime, our full-time staffing has been reduced to 10% of its original size. Staffing for events was dangerously low and maintenance was not dealt with for two years.
