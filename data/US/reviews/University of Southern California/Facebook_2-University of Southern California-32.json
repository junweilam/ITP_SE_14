Faculty often treat staff like second class citizens.  and this has created a strong Us vs. Them environment.  Since most management were faculty, they're often viewed as already biased towards them. Usually each school's dean has a 10 year term, really two 5 year terms.  So depending when you come to USC, you may be nearing the end of a dean's term.  usually any new dean will clean house and bring in his cronies. \r\n\r\nThere's also inter-school politics.

This includes faculty, who are given management roles over staff people who trump them in actual management experience.  To my knowledge, there is little to no training for managers and no mentorship on how to grow teams and empower people. In short, management overall is a disaster.

So, I'm really struggling financially, and living paycheck to paycheck, despite me having a Masters degree.  My boss has promised on getting me a raise (and that's also why I took the position), but its almost been a year and nothing yet.  I now how to look for a 2nd job, because I'm struggling.  I live very basic and I never expected to be so stressed with finances when I accepted this position.  Also, I expected more out of the benefits package.  The retirement is excellent, as USC will match my contribution.  However, the medical is too expensive.  I am paying about $250 a month for just my husband and me to have basic coverage.  The copay's and Rx benefits are also expensive ($25-50 for an office visit, $15+ for an Rx).  I previously came from the University of California system, and their health benefits were much, much better ($15 copay's, $10 Rx).  Also, what I'm finding equally as frustrating is how disjointed and fragmented the USC system is.  No one is accountable here, and no one knows what is going on.  We don't have set departments to contact for assistance (e.g. - human resources, purchases, etc.), and we don't have any employee development courses, etc.  I don't understand how this institution lasted for so long like this.  Even the employee orientation was confusing, and there is no one to speak to for assistance signing up for benefits, answering my questions ,etc.  They just showed these vague, short 2 min youtube clips on medical, dental, vision benefits.  That is not effective, and just lazy.  Again, I really like my boss and the work I'm doing; however, it I cannot receive a pay increase, I find it difficult to stay here much longer.  And it is true what others have said about staff being low on the totem pole in comparison to faculty.  My dept hosted a retreat; however, no staff were allowed to attend.  Only faculty could go.  It showed me that even though my boss values me (who is a faculty member), on the whole, I am not valued to other faculty members within my dept.  Also, there has been a lot of turnover here at the Health Science Campus, which raises red flags with me.  USC is losing a lot of talent to other organizations.
