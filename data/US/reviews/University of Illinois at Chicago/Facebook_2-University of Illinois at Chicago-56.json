I heard of students struggling to pay bills with the pay they were receiving (I was fortunate to have a higher stipend based the department I worked in). It's bad enough that the students will go on strike to demand higher pay every few years (many instructors also support this and also will protest for higher pay in their union as well). You may deal with disgruntled undergraduate students as a TA who are upset due to factors that are out of your control (though in some ways this was a positive experience in that it helped me develop skills in handling such situations as stated above). There were sometimes communication issues with instructors as to expectations but I think a large part of it was due to having to adapt different teaching modalities during COVID times and then having to transition back to in-person teaching."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Important work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Staff Nurse I in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You help patients who really need help - you feel valuable in that way.

It's all done online initially, but once hired, you show up to HR where you will read and fill quite a few forms, many are ethical in nature (won't discriminate, hurt, steal, etc) .  While it is extremely difficult to get any job at UIC because of the current hiring freeze (which really isn't a freeze...it's more of a slow down), you can either go the civil route (need to take exam) or academic route.  Many jobs are not advertised and there is a way to get a temporary 6 month assignment through the academic route where departments fill short-comings in their staffs.  They do advertise the official civil and academic jobs, but in my opinion, these are very hard to get because so many people apply for the small amount of jobs listed.  The temporary academic jobs can lead to a full time job if they decide to formally create the position which has to be approved by HR.   Once hired, the process takes a while for HR to get you \"official.\"  It took about one month since being hired to start.  While HR is very nice, they are by the book and will not help you in any way to give advice.  I think this is because of past cronyism  that has been cleaned up and they probably are trained not to help to avoid any perceived preference to candidates.  Once in the system, the benefits are pretty standard but as an employee, classes are free and you can earn your degree as long as you get accepted in the program of course.  The campus is safe where I work (by the medical campus).  There are police everywhere, emergency telephone beacons every block, and the hospital campus is pretty safe.  The Polk street L station is close by and UIC and CTA buses are everywhere.  Taylor street is awesome.  A lot of great pubs, restaurants, etc.  You also can get breaks at the new beautiful fitness center, CTA passes, and even a discount on your Sprint cell phone bill ($35 off my family plan!), and very cheap software for your personal use like Windows, Office for Mac (only $90!), Adobe Suites, etc. There are also many groups, organizations, associations, lectures, etc that are open to many so you can easily get involved if you have the desire.  The students are very down to Earth and I have not encountered attitudes like the \"I am God complex\" that are typical of DePaul, Loyola, Northwestern and University of Chicago students.  The students are culturally diverse and so are the staffs which is so refreshing.", "cons": "HR is currently re-classifying all academic jobs and they are converting them to civil jobs to prevent the academic departments from hiring people they know, but in my opinion, HR just ends up hiring some unqualified people because they seem to go out of their way to hire people without graduate degrees from what I have been noticing, thus opening jobs to a greater proportion of the population that don't supposedly get a fair shake at jobs traditionally held by people with graduate degrees, but the quality of hires goes down. I don't think a graduate degree is the ultimate qualification for every job, but that should not be counted against you when applying.  I think they need to re-think their hiring process.   Also, many academics run the departments you work in and they don't tell you about all the benefits like tuition reimbursements, etc."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Working at UIC College of Dentistry", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Staff Nurse II and Clinical Management in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent salary and benefits\r\nDay shift, no weekends or holidays\r\nCivil Service and union status", "cons": "Lack of leadership and direction\r\nDifficult to implement positive changes\r\nResistance to improvements/changes\r\nLack of mentoring of employees\r\nLack of encouragement to attend training or further career\r\nSmall pay raises\r\nEmployees not monitored for work performance, lack of performance reviews"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "A great opportunity to earn some money and a tuition waiver.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Mar 2012", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Monthly Stipend\r\n- Tuition waiver\r\n- Ineresting work\r\n- Publication opportunities\r\n- Interdepartmental collaborations\r\n- Great system of alumni and collaborators to network with when heading out into industry", "cons": "- May have to work beyond your paid 20 hrs\r\n- Have to research what is being funded\r\n- Older buildings have poor heating and cooling, resulting in annoyingly warm or cold temperatures for months at a time."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor pay and riddled with Bureaucracy", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Visiting Research Specialist in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My specific grant funded job was great and I had a great boss.

No consequences for inability to perform basic responsibilities. No consequences even for people who fail to arrive to work altogether, repeatedly, over the course of years, without reason. These are the people you will have to deal with, and pick up the slack for, if you are employed here. The University carries a lot of dead weight on a lot of different and costly levels. \r\n\r\nEvery task is a process that requires many months time in order to complete. For example: Every single person in one department, upon receiving and accepting an offer for a position from the university, and after reporting to the job full-time, did not get PAID for 3+ months (in one case - for 6 MONTHS!) - only god knows why. \"Processing\" HR would say. Lots of phone calls to lots of different people who would each tell you something entirely different and refer you to someone else who was equally ill-equipped to answer basic questions they were required to know the answers to, as part of their job. After having not been paid for my first month of employment, I was told that period was considered \"Volunteer\" work, after which I would begin to be paid. Lies. They exploit employees, period. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, employees were literally let go at the end of their contracts without any notice, and without any knowledge that they were let go at all. Four words: Milton from Office Space. People would continue to report to their jobs as usual, as they have been for 3+ years, because no one in management or HR told them: \"Oh, by the way, we have not renewed your employment contract with UIC, and you no longer work here.\" (Typically, they were automatically renewed from year to year without discussion, simply, \"Sign this.\") Employees in \"Visiting\" positions whose contracts were not renewed at the end of their term only learned they no longer had a job - an entire month after they lost their jobs - because they did not see a paycheck automatically deposited into their bank accounts. Management allowed employees to continue to believe they were employed, and to continue to work, despite funding having run out for their positions and thus not paying them anymore. Even more unbelievable, this didn't occur in a single instance - this was department-wide (for  employees with an academic departmental position). \r\n\r\nMore minor issues, comparatively: No raises. After several years of employment, it became costly to remain in this job, due to rising cost of living, and the stagnation of pay. Raises simply did not exist, and you can't get a straight answer from anyone as to why this is. You can't get a straight answer from anyone about anything, in general. Management will lie, or deflect, or cite ignorance, etc. \r\n\r\nNo room for growth: In this particular position - you cannot go anywhere beyond \"Research Coordinator.\" This is typical of this position in academia, however.  Unless you are pursuing a PhD in the field, which you can then perform your own research under. A Clinical Research Position in the corporate environment would progress into greater possibilities. \r\n\r\nHigher ups are often less knowledgeable than their research assistants. They don't know their own protocols. Their in-house practices do not match the contracts they agreed upon with funding institutions. They disregard eligibility criteria in favor of getting as many participants  in a study as possible. They simply don't know how to conduct (their own!) research. They have no clue what is required day-to-day in order for their studies to run smoothly. They don't know how to analyze data. They don't know where their laboratory equipment is located or how to use it. There is no guidance or support for RAs. RAs are expected to train themselves in areas of work the PI cannot and does no perform. And then, when there is an issue, the RAs are immediately to blame.. The issues go on, and on, and on... \r\n\r\nThe list of grievances is miles long. Stay away from this University. Appointed officials are corrupt. Management is completely lost. Many employees are incompetent and simply do not perform work. There is no support. There is no accountability. There is no transparency."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Useful as an introduction to research", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tuition waiver and decent salary with the possibility of publishing research papers and add then to your research experience.
