Some of the benefits are nice -- they get a biweekly fruit delivery, have a free bike program to help employees run errands and offer generous vacation to longstanding employees. They also have an unofficial but decade-long practice of giving staff the stretch between Christmas Eve and New Year's off as paid leave and recently introduced an annual bring-your-dog-to-work day.

It did NOT, according to my research on Salary.com, but when I asked for the data that supported their conclusion, they never responded. The Academy was a great place to work seven-plus years ago, but work-life balance can be pretty bad in some departments, with little to no recognition for sacrifice. After one huge, extremely demanding project I worked on, the core team got only the usual annual bonus for that year (less than one paycheck after taxes; bonuses depend on the fiscal-year outcome) and a worse-than-usual thank-you meal. After putting in about 130 hours' overtime toward the end of the project -- the most in my near-decade there, with multiple 12-hour days -- I got only two days of unofficial comp time and a fractionally higher annual merit increase. (I don't think our team had any larger a merit pool, despite the project; I think that was just how my manager chose to allocate it.)

Benefits overall are the best I've ever had, especially the 401k.  You can choose between Kaiser or Blue Cross for medical.  Dental is ok, but vision is surprisingly poor.  Professional development is offered to everyone, though some managers/depts encourage it more than others, and you may not be able to do something if it isn't directly related to your current job, even if it would help you be more promotable within the org. People seem to give praise and thanks to each other pretty freely, so it is a supportive environment in that way.  We usually get the week from Christmas to New Year's as a bonus week off.

This makes it extremely difficult to promote to better positions.  It also means there's a lack of fresh blood with new approaches and perspectives, resulting in a lot of \"well, we always do it this way...\".  Some upper management tend to be too influenced by advanced degrees and fancy schools and job titles, which has resulted in some poor hiring decisions.  I think most \"middle\" people are underpaid at least 10-20%.  Though managers do give praise, the way the evaluation system is set up, it's almost impossible to achieve more than a \"satisfactory\" rating.  Also each job is assigned a level number which is too inflexible; so even if you  achieve more or improve something better than your predecessor, you are still stuck in place.  This is especially frustrating when you end up with more responsibility, achievements, and skills than your numeric (and salary) equals.
