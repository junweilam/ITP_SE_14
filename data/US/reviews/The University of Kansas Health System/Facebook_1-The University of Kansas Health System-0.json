They strive to put patients concerns and cares as first priority and for the most part, they live up to this goal. \r\n\r\nIn my position, the pay was acceptable, certainly neither in the upper or lower ranges for the this clinical specialty. \r\n\r\nIt is exciting to be a part of a growing corporation and at this time, UKH is growing. The place is getting good press and is admired in the community and the country. Having that underlying pride and admiration for the organization in which you work is really uplifting and makes you want to go to work every day. \r\n\r\nThere are many opportunities to get into committees and nursing practice governance. In these committees you get to know other people throughout the organization, and that can be fun and helpful to your career. There is support for advancing your education such as getting a master's degree or a doctorate. \r\n\r\nMany direct care positions work 12 hour shifts, and some areas have other schedules.

This is the cultural norm for the department of nursing and by my observation, you are thought less of if you don't have a certifications, but you are not thought more of (or given more opportunities, autonomy, or pay) if you have them. This kind of emphasis on certification and degrees is probably common in academic institutions and magnet institutions. \r\n\r\nThe culture of the institution has a physician emphasis, regardless of expertise. That is, physicians' opinions on non-medical business practices can outweigh business specialists' knowledge and expertise. Decisions are sometimes made thusly. \r\n\r\nIt's possible to \"lay low\" and quietly do your job. Tread carefully if you decide to get involved in all the governance and committee work. I observed bullying and favoritism from time to time among those who hold power in the organization. \r\n\r\nParking at the main campus is annoying - there isn't enough available nearby for the staff and the patients.

Sure they say it's only for PTO related absences, however my department won't let you take time off without pay so I basically can't ever be sick without getting dinged for it. Real life happens, KU... accept it. However, my real issue is actually with how upper management treats its employees. Lack of communication and support have been rampant lately, with employees hardly being informed about mandatory training or job changes until the last minute. Half of the time lower-level management doesn't even know what's going on, making it seem like a very 'fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants atmosphere'...hardly what you'd expect from a nationally recognized hospital system. Support is also hard to find within a department, as half of management can't be bothered to answer your questions or even point you in the right direction. So good luck finding an answer...hope you figure it out before review time comes around! Advancement opportunities are also hard to find as management often promotes based on the length of your relationship with the institution, rather than actual work ethic and the ability to do the job. Sure, as with most places it's who you know but it's a real shame because management is starting to become overrun with people who really don't understand how to support or manage their employees properly."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Rapidly Expanding Organization - Great Environment, Great Benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Applications Analyst in Mission, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is a growing organization that is bringing on new hires all the time.

Excellent nursing care. Good facilities. Many outstanding physicians across numerous specialties. Patients appreciate the facilities, except for the non-private rooms. Physician salaries are good.", "cons": "Management has lost a focus on number of things, most importantly the actual quality of outcomes for patients. They have a single minded focus on getting larger, at the expense of making certain that the patients they already have receive care at the highest level.  To be sure, the advertising to patients says \"quality\" and so does what they say internally, but management actions belie these claims over and over and over.  When there is a choice between excellent patient care and procedures that make more money, they always, always choose the more money route. They have sold the sizzle, while the steak goes bad.  When a concerned physician became a whistle blower for a cover up of a bad patient outcome, the management fired him from his leadership position and redoubled their efforts at sweeping their willful disregard for patient safety and well-being . This is documented in court records. They previously paid nurses at higher rates than other hospitals in the region, so as to attract the best ones. Now  that they have a reputation, they say it isn't \"fair\" to pay more. Management has too many layers, and control is from the very top; even hiring a medical assistant for a clinic or an administrative assistant must be signed off by the CEO.  When the hospital acquired the physician practice, there were promises that management would adopt a diad structure, such that a physician would be paired with an administrator at all levels, ensuring that patient safety and needs were met by relying on physician input. This would be the management style of the Mayo Clinic. Those promises were abandoned.  What few physicians are allowed in management are all demonstrably \"yes\" men. Any physician who speaks truth to the CEO, including the former CMO, regardless of their skill level, is let go, because management views any dissent as disloyalty.  And finally, management in this institution, like management in most hospitals forgets that EVERY dollar generated is generated because a physician has performed and billed for a service.  It should be clear, even if your focus is on the financial, that anything that facilitates interactions between physicians and patients, rather than making them more difficult, is of financial benefit to the organization. Things that make those interactions more difficult in any way do not generate revenue but destroy it. And finally, like many lesser institutions, this one hires nurses as executives because they are cheaper, while falsely believing that they are garnering \"clinical\" or \"medical\" expertise. Nurses are not and will not ever be physicians, and they cannot understand the commitments to patients that physicians undertake (compare the number of nurses taking calls at home with the number of physicians who do so nightly), nor can they understand the medical issues. Not that nurses make poor managers; they are as smart and hard working as any other executive. But it is a delusion to believe that they bring any particular medical insight to the equation. Nevertheless, this management relies on nurses to provide information that they are not capable of providing."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Nursing Assistant in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They treat us really well and allow us to participate in ideas that help workflow.", "cons": "Brainstorming doesn't always allow for staffing vs. needs of the patient.
