Technical support and systems. First-rate support from the IT Department, in every respect. Their use of technology, and the ability to trouble-shoot remotely on those few occasions when I had trouble (always due to my lack of knowledge, not a system error), is just fantastic. The nearly full set of Blackboard tools are available, as well as nearly the full set of BannerWeb (called TopNet here) tools. My college has a full-time IT Tech, located in our building, as well.\r\n2. Interactive video instruction technology - also great. I did a brief training on the system in August, and since then my experience has been flawless. I taught one course this year that had students on-campus and, at the same time, in two remote locations. Technically, the experience was flawless. Facilitators were at the other locations to assist in coordination, and in proctoring of exams.\r\n3. Support for research. While this is not my focus, there appears to be much support for grant identification and application. Also, and despite being a pedagogical professor, I received a good personal allotment for professional development activities this year.\r\n4. Training in instruction. I've taken advantage of several opportunities for education in pedagogical techniques, from both dedicated staff and from panel discussions consisting of peers. Very helpful.\r\n5. Campus. It is a beautiful layout. The academic buildings are all within a few blocks of each other. The architecture is well above-average, and in the most recent decades there has been a greater focus on appearance when constructing new buildings. It has the feel of a smaller campus, despite 20,000 or so students. None of the academic buildings seem more than five stories, and there is plenty of grass and trees, making for some lovely scenery and a relaxed atmosphere.\r\n6. Students. I've been very impressed with the student population, overall. (I'm teaching juniors and seniors, which may skew my opinions somewhat.) And, the major I teach in is fairly difficult (although not the most difficult on campus), which may skew my view. Still, I have been very impressed by the attitudes and attentiveness of the students. Yes, like all students, they need to be motivated; but they respond well to the use of motivational techniques and instruction in personal self-development. Several times this semester, in team projects and in individual assignments, I have been extremely impressed with the students' efforts.\r\n7. Academic advisement. I don't have any academic advisement responsibilities, per se, as our college has dedicated academic advisors. My students report that all six of the academic advisors are great, except one. I still counsel students, of course, but not having to worry about course scheduling has freed me up with more time to spend on career counseling, as well as job and internship outreach and placement.\r\n8. Food. This semester a donor to the campus provided every professor with one free \"meal swipe\" a week, which will continue for Spring 2016. I typically eat at \"Fresh Food\" - a cafeteria-like environment serving healthier foods. Other options at the Downing Student Union include Chick Fil A, Lil' John's Pizza, Starbucks, and a burrito place (quite popular with the students). I've tried them all and have been well-pleased. You can purchase \"meal swipes\" (loaded to your i.d. card) as a professor for under $6 a meal (includes drink). Other food options exist on campus, at various locations. Off campus, Bowling Green is sometimes said to be the \"restaurant capital of the world\" on a per capita basis, and I have had many pleasurable dining experiences.\r\n9. Parking. I arrive before 8am, and have never had a problem parking in the parking garage nearest my building (only a block's walk away). At times during football games (a couple were held during the week) I had to park in a different lot, which was a couple of blocks further away - but even then had no problem finding a spot. Some professors who go out to lunch return to find a lack of spaces in their preferred faculty lot, but it seems that there are always faculty spaces available in some of the lots, just a bit further away. As is the case with most universities, students encounter some parking difficulties, if they arrive on campus in the late morning; WKU has a plan to build more parking structures.\r\n10. 403(b) Plan. H.R. has done a pretty good job with its 403(b) plan, with TIAA-CREF, Fidelity, and a couple of other custodians as options. It also has a 457 plan for additional deferment opportunities.\r\n11. Health Plan. I came from a state that had one of the best health plans in the country. Here, the plans are unique, in that there is a higher initial out-of-pocket each year. However, you can participate in various wellness programs where the University makes a nice contribution to an HRA and/or an HSA, which in turn limits your out-of-pocket costs. Overall, I'd rate this level of health benefits as a \"B\" - better by far than most in the commercial business world, but not as great as a few states' health insurance benefits.\r\n12. Collegiality, Mentoring. I'm sure this varies by Department, and by College, but within my department and college I am extremely well pleased. We have a great Dean and Asst. Dean, and they are very supportive, while being common-sense in their decisions, as far as I can see.\r\n13. Development/endowment. Appears to be a substantial endowment, and the President and Deans are raising more in endowment funds each year. Also, various \"Centers\" exist within each college, and external support for these Centers appears to generally be excellent.\r\n14. Overall, I've been most pleased with my first six months' experience, and with the level of support provided at all levels.", "cons": "Hmmm, every place has its \"cons\" ...\r\n1. Student parking. Always a concern at a larger university. But the number of student complaints is not all that great here. Parking for visitors seems to be available, as well. There is student parking available, always, but it may require parking remotely (at a lot several blocks away, or another larger one at the \"South Campus\" about 2 miles away) and taking a bus, which could be time-consuming for students. The campus administration appears to be committed to expanding the parking close to campus, through the erection of more parking structures on existing lots near campus. Overall, I would rate this a \"C+\" - although recognizing that most (if not all) larger universities struggle to keep up with student parking needs.\r\n2. Defined benefit plan. I chose the defined contribution (403b) plan over the defined contribution plan, although I have 6 years to possibly elect to switch over to the defined benefit (pension) plan. The State of Kentucky severely underfunded the Kentucky Teachers pension plan (which includes university professors), and this has created a real budget problem going forward for the State to address. And, like most defined benefit (pension) plans provided by the states, stricter rules now apply as to when vesting occurs and as to how benefits are accumulated; these rules are applicable to newer employees, which makes the defined benefit plan less attractive. I would rate the pension plan as a \"D-\" at present, due primarily to its underfunding. This situation is not something the University's Administration controls, but is a problem created by the State Legislature.\r\n3. Student retention is above-average for the freshmen year, but only average thereafter, relative to other similar institutions in the state, and nationwide. I'd give the University a grade of \"C\" on this. It does have a lot of programs and support for students, but from my conversations with students it appears that connecting students to the resources on campus requires more effort.\r\n4. Faculty/staff morale. While it is readily apparent that the professors here are fully supported in terms of their teaching/writing/service activities, the lack of merit increases and relatively low pay increases over the past several years has taken its toll and affected faculty/staff morale, to a degree. While my starting salary was appropriate, in my view, and substantial increases result with promotion, there continues to be uncertainty as to the State Legislature's support of higher education, in general, and faculty/staff salaries, in particular. Great universities emerge when they attract great talent, and without a restoration of CPI and merit pay increases to appropriate levels then WKU will, despite its great progress over the years (from what I have seen and heard), start falling behind. While nearly all state universities have seen reduced state financial support over the past decade, it remains unclear whether the State of Kentucky will get back on track with its support of higher education. I give this one a tentative \"D-\" ... much depends on the State Legislature's actions in the Spring 2016 session, when they adopt a new 2-year budget. For this reason I rate the \"Business Outlook\" at \"neutral\" below, rather than \"thumbs up.\""}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great University, But As With Most Colleges State Financial Support Poses Challenges for the Future", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 May 2017", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Bowling Green, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A. Beautiful campus. Relatively compact, as well, providing for relatively easy walking to/from classes and events. (Students complain about \"the Hill\" - but it's nothing compared to elevation increases seen at many other campuses.) New parking structure will further ease parking pressures on students - which are always present, but no where as severe as they are at most other universities.\r\nB. Diverse but generally pleasant, peaceful campus community. Relatively low crime rate.\r\nC. Nice facilities, in general. Although several academic halls are dated and in need of modernization (this is likely to exist on nearly any college campus). Still, many of the buildings are new or have been recently renovated, and are very pleasant and functional.\r\nD. Great football team. Great tailgating parties.\r\nE. While it may vary from college to college, in general I believe the leadership of the university is top notch. The new President brings forth a new catalyst for changes to occur.\r\nF. A very student-centric focus of the university, generally.\r\nG. A cohesive, student-focused faculty and staff, despite the lack of funding for faculty salary increases over many years. I'm rather surprised that faculty and staff morale and dedication is as high as it is - and this is a credit to the strength of character of Western's faculty and staff.\r\nH. Great IT support, in all respects.\r\nI. Benefits provided to employees remain good. Better than in most states, but not as good as some states. Still, this remains a positive.", "cons": "1. The largest concern is, and will be, the decline in state funding. The State of Kentucky, second only (perhaps) to Illinois, has a severe crisis as to the under-funding of its defined benefit plans. Of the total $11-12B state budget, $1.5B now goes to the state pension plan. A recent report indicates that a total of $2.2B is needed, for many years - a $700M increase in funding for the state retirement plans, each year! If the State Legislature addresses this problem (which it must), continued cuts to higher education (and nearly all other parts of the Kentucky State Budget) are inevitable.\r\n    2. This must be put against the backdrop of the lack of substantial faculty/staff pay raises - for many years. While, nationwide, the state support for higher education has rebounded, up 15% or so (and, if you exclude Illinois, up 20% or so) over the past five years, this is not the case in Kentucky. We are down 5.2% in state support over the past 5 years. And, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (in 2016), Kentucky ranked 6th-worst among states in the percent change to higher education funding per student since 2008. The amount of state funding provided for each student in Kentucky dropped 32 percent, or $2,771, since the recession in 2008 (until the report date).\r\n    3. The effect of this lack of state funding is felt most by students. Higher tuition rates have occurred, although Western Kentucky University still remains quite affordable compared to other universities (both in Kentucky and elsewhere). Housing costs for students, and in general the cost of living, remains low relative to many other college locales. Still, the \"funding gap\" for students which has occurred (due to the lack of federal increases in the sizes of grants) continues to be exacerbated, as WKU's tuition rates continue to (modestly) increase, and as new student fees are added at times.\r\n    4. As a result of the above, faculty and staff pay is low, relative to other (benchmark) institutions. This has resulted in various inequities (as often exist at universities, as they pay new talent nearly as much as experienced faculty). And it has led to the loss of too many highly qualified applicants, as they receive better offers for employment from competing universities. While a 3% pay increase over 2 years has been provided (after years of none), this has not even kept salaries up with inflation over the two-year period (in all likelihood).\r\n     5. The \"easy\" budget cuts have likely already been made. Cuts to student services are likely, in the future. As are possible cuts to entire programs, depending on the severity of state under-funding."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great benefits.

They will never grow or become anything more than a regional university.\r\n\r\nMost universities attempt to hire only graduates from other universities as faculty. The keeps ideas flowing, and promotes growth and diversity. The staff in at least one of the colleges of the university is almost entirely made up of WKU graduates who teach things the way they've been taught for 20 plus years. This is no way to lead a progressive educational institution into the future. There are also very few diverse faculty of any type other than Caucasian in this same college. The ones that were of other races or cultures either left or were discriminated against when it comes to tenure and promotion. One, who was a practicing member of the Jewish faith was questioned with a veiled threat of punishment, as to why they needed days off for major Jewish holidays. \r\n\r\nAt least in one college that I taught in, the review policy is shoddy and flawed at best. One person reviews you each year. If they don't care for you, or your student reviews are less than stellar (actually they can rationalize anyway they choose since it's only them making the decision) you lose your job. It doesn't matter if this was because they didn't like you for political or personal reasons, overheard detrimental rumors by students in the hallway (this happened to me, and was counted as a negative on my review. Since we all know every student is happy with every teacher everyday without fail. This was a silly and trivial typical unhappy student just venting situation too.), they can just get rid of you. There's no oversight or fair trial. Just a whim.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are decent. Better than other universities I've been at actually. But the pay was $10k less than any other public institution a colleague and I researched in the nation. That's for the exact same faculty position. You will also be expected to teach a 5/5 load if you are in this college and not tenure. Tenure is 3/3. That's ridiculous, and an overload at most institutions.\r\n\r\nTo maintain quality faculty, breed diversity, and bring in other methods and skills besides those already taught at the university they need to seriously review and revamp their hiring, dismissal, salary, and other faculty policies.\r\n\r\nThey also will accept students who score incredibly low on college entrance exams, and then place them into classes way above their level of current ability with few resources to help them. This sets these students up to fail, only to end up with student loans they cannot afford to pay back. It's all about retention at any cost at this school. I have never known another university that will reinstate students who have failed classes, give them a pad on the class they failed, and let them go on, just to keep \"numbers up.\" Is deplorable in so many ways."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "OK Place for a Graduate Assistantship", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Master's Level Graduate Assistant in Bowling Green, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My graduate assistantship hours are extremely flexible and I like my advisers and coworkers.", "cons": "The pay is just a basic subsistence stipend and not much else.
