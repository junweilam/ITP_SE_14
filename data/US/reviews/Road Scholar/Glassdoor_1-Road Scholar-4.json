They will tell you how to speak, how to feel, how to think. Not a lot of room for growth or for moving to other departments outside of the one that hires you. I believe this strongly limits the company as everyone tends to get stuck in the same role and no one understands how the other departments work. This caused frequent issues with the sales people who would tell customers things that were not true about booking flights. It can result in having people in positions they don't even like with no escape. The jog offers benefits, but I feel as if the benefits are mediocre considering how much stress, anxiety, and work the job actually is. My entire training class was hired during the absolute worst time to work in the travel industry. We were forced to stay late every day to answer calls, we answered call after call after call all day long. We dealt with customers who were irate at the company for not booking flights earlier for them or angry at the sales people for lying to them about flights.

The health insurance was amazing and the 301b retirement plan was 100% matched by Road Scholar, which is unheard of. My main issue was that the pay scale didn't always make sense with the scale of the job. For instance, those on the phones made almost $18/hr, whereas the Programs Associates started at $16/hr... Don't get me wrong, I know being on the phones is mentally draining and difficult because you're dealing with sometimes frustrated customers all day, however, they are basically reading off a script all day long. The Programs Associates do a significant amount of work compared to that, and during the busiest seasons, barely have time to take a breath because their plates are so full. Quite honestly, it made the associates feel as they they were taken for granted and not respected.  Maybe have the start pay for the Programs Associates be the same as the phone jobs... would make a lot more sense and reduce animosity. \n\nThe only other con I have is towards the contact center manager (only at the office I worked at in particular).  This manager could be incredibly condescending and rude. It was clear when she didn't like someone and she played favorites. I didn't even work for her, and this was something people knew.
