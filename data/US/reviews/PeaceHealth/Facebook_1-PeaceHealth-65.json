Many times it was only myself, the ACA officer and Mobile 1 (shift lead) for the entire hospital, and when Code Greys and other issues arose that required standby, there were few moments that felt like I was out of my depth. That said, the security leadership at Peace Health Southwest is about as braindead as they can get, and do more to assuage their egos, than taking responsibility for the safety of the staff and patients.

They will be given the option of voluntary severance or bidding for open positions in other departments.  This is all part of their most recent \u201cre-organization\u201d which originally started with trying to push Nurses and CNA2 to 12 hour shifts.  Both unions fought back and now 12 hour shifts are voluntary for current staff.  I am most concerned about the elimination of the float pool.  That means caregivers will frequently float to all departments, including ones they might not be competent in.  It also means the floors may be left short staffed.  Over the last year, the shift I\u2019ve worked on has been forced to care for 12+ patients due to shortages in staff.  It is very difficult to give good care under those circumstances.

Nurses are routinely floated to another floor after four hours and then have to return at the end of their shift to chart on the first four hours.  After being a nurse there I would never let a family member stay the night alone.  I know the nurses are working their hardest but as a nurse you don't even get a chance to look up your patients before you get report.  You come in early but still have to wait until the charge nurse finally makes the assignment.  I've worked in much safer facilities.  I wouldn't recommend working there unless you feel comfortable doing total care for six patients at one time because often that's just what ends up happening if you get a CNA who is completely overloaded or who doesn't want to do their job.
