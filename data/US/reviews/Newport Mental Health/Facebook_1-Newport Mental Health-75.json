During that time the organization doubled in size. As with any organization that is in a growth mode, it means there is tons of opportunity for anyone with initiative and vision who wants to move things forward. I found the organization's administrative team to be creative in it's thinking about problem solving, and this is why I joined the team. Those inside the industry know that it's a exciting time to be in mental health because of a confluence of factors. The clinical labor market is incredibly tight, yet funding is plentiful. The public spotlight is on mental health which creates opportunity and accountability. The clinical work and outcomes are literally life or death, and it's a community based organization so you don't have the distance from outcomes that you'd expect at a larger company. I found the work incredibly meaningful, and all-encompassing. Which is what a community deserves from leaders at a community mental health center. I highly recommend Newport Mental Health.", "cons": "Because of rapid growth, the organization is short on physical space and is in the process of securing additional space for employees who work in the office."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great team but worst management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Health Care Data Analyst in Newport, RI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Only good thing about this position is some of the coworkers.

The two higher ups there like to pick on people and if you are on their \"radar\" as everyone there calls it, you're screwed.
