Due to this you will be prepared and very well equipped to know when your rights are being violated, when you are being targeted and bullied, when your mental and physical health is being threatened and damaged, and what just about every single instance of pettiness, meanness, cruelty, and unethical and immoral behavior looks like first hand. However, after you leave Concord you will no longer be powerless to do anything about it. In this sense, Concord could be considered as boot camp for working in any truly unethical cut throat toxic work environment elsewhere, which could be considered a pro by some who are dumb enough to get a job somewhere else that resembles anything like Concord.", "cons": "Sub par wages in disgusting maintenance deferred old smelly buildings filthy with asbestos, lead paint, and carpet complete with traces of urine and feces from overflowed toilets, leaky roofs, mold, and terrible ventilation, heat, and air are the standard at Concord. Absolutely nothing you do is valued or respected, there are lots of backstabbing liars who are consistently trying to sabotage everything you do, every day you fear losing your job, or a surprise pay cut that can happen at any minute due to consistent budget cuts, financial irresponsibility, and expensive self-serving admin pet projects that no one actually wants or supports. The entire campus is filthy with mistrust, pettiness, meanness, incompetence, irresponsibility, abuse, and waste. Complacency is more than an expected norm and takes the form of cultism in that those who get fed up and stand up for themselves and/or justice in any way are first not considered team players, then labeled as enemies of the institution, and eventually targeted and eliminated by the President and her administration. It is standard practice for Human Resources to treat all employees as not valued and HR is not only non-supportive and incompetent, but can instantly become abusive, intimidating, and threatening if you feel your rights have been violated and ask for their help. There are no employee rights that are enforced or enforceable unless you go off campus and get a lawyer which is SOP for most abused employees, many of which do in fact win their court cases and then leave the school and the area anyway. Absolutely nothing holds the President and her cronies accountable for anything including bullying, intimidation, targeting, firing, and trying to ruin the lives of dedicated tenured faculty and staff that worked at the school for decades, not to mention the unbridled crazy excessive self compensation levels for administrators and their bought off loyal cronies that truly resembles some sort of legalized internal profiteering or embezzlement scheme at the expense of the students, faculty, staff, and tax payers. There is no job security, and your salary is much less than anywhere else you could get the same job, unless you are administrator or one of the multitude of bought off local loyalists, and you will never get a raise besides annual increment pay that only covers a fraction of the yearly increase of the cost of living. WV PEIA insurance is not that cheap, doesn\u2019t cover hardly anything even after your $1000 deductible, has very high copays, and there are very few competent doctors or dentists in the area anyway so you will most likely have to drive to Virginia and pay extra for being out of network unless you don\u2019t mind extremely subpar healthcare bordering on malpractice. The town hates the school and the school the town. It\u2019s really an unhealthy atmosphere in just about every way surrounded by drugs and crime although well disguised and fraudulently marketed as a quaint small town in the beautiful mountains where everyone is considered \u201cfamily.\u201d Absolute terrible place to raise children unless you are a huge fan of lots of family violence, exposure to drugs and criminal behavior, sexual abuse and assault, constant fear of harm, geographic and social isolation, and the resulting adverse mental health outcomes these will have on you and your children. Mercer County Schools are the worst that bully children who do not support Donald Trump Republicans and/or attend bible classes, both of which are emphasized in the public schools over science, history, and knowledge in general by pathetic religiously and politically biased teachers who don\u2019t even know their subject matter. Therefore most Concord employees home school their children, so be prepared. Everyone has an attitude and a gun and are looking for excuses to use them. There was a recent admin proposal to allow open carry on campus and for students to have guns in the dorms. Most have guns in their cars now regardless of policy which is not enforced. Concord can be not only toxic and unhealthy in just about every way imaginable, it is also a terrifying place to work and live at times, especially with the culture of hate, violence, guns, and drugs in the area and so much stalking and sexual assault on campus. There is basically little to no competent law enforcement that you can truly count on for protection and everything that happens is quickly covered up while victims are usually blamed and targeted instead of perpetrators. With all of this being said, nothing ever changes and everything seems to just keep getting worse every day making it such a self-defeating, self-deprecating, depressing, anxiety provoking, and hopeless place to work and live."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Creative Services Manager in Athens, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, beautiful campus, friendly coworkers", "cons": "Work a lot of overtime with no extra pay"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Nice friendly place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Director of Admissions in Athens, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Concord has a friendly welcoming environment.
