If you are looking into working at Sullivan, I would encourage you to read all of it. I want to be exhaustive in my experience working here, so I can warn the next person. There is nothing I can say about the pros after evaluating my total experience working at Sullivan University. Thus, it is going to be one giant Cons of working at Sullivan. Do not work here. Sullivan University is a For-Profit, private university. All the institution cares about is bringing in money by any means necessary. Don't be tempted by the slightly higher than average industry pay that Sullivan offers. The education at Sullivan University is terrible. My particular area of work was admissions in their Allied Health programs, particularly nursing. Nursing students at Sullivan University that actually get through the nursing program (many don't), as of 2022, ONLY 43.3% of nursing students pass the NCLEX which is required for employment in nursing. This information can be found on the Kentucky Board of Nursing: Prelicensure Program of Nursing Benchmarks. This means that 56.7% of Sullivan University nursing students take on tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt and won't be able to go into nursing. As an Admissions Advisor, we are instructed by management to heavily push student loans onto students, even if it means adding a crushing burden of debt onto the students, all for the sake of \"hitting the numbers\". Not to mention that their student retention rate is terrible. We are told to factor students dropping out of the program into our enrollment goals. Students that drop out still have to pay the loans they took out, and the way Sullivan prepares their financial package, they have to pay for 3 semesters/quarters at a time. Meaning that if the student drops out after the first semester/quarter, they will still have to pay for the second and third. In the eyes of the admissions office at Sullivan, you are not a student, you are a lead. You are a means to acquire money, that is it. They prey particularly on the underprivilege \"leads\" and use predatory techniques to rope you into attending Sullivan. During the introductory admissions training, I was instructed to always control of the conversation and not let the \"lead\" ask questions. To solidify Sullivan University's commitment to exploiting their \"leads\", I was reprimanded for saying at the end of a call, \"Do you have any other questions before I let you go?\". This is predatory, plain and simple.", "cons": "I am now going to move on to my personal experience working here. To give a little background, I have prior experience in higher education admissions. I worked for an admissions office that was wildly successful before working at Sullivan. Before starting, I read the other plethora of negative reviews here on Glassdoor but merely thought that the reviews were made by people who slacked off or didn't know how an admissions office works. I was wrong. As an Admissions Advisor, you have weekly accountability meetings to discuss your progress and enrollment numbers. During my meetings I was told I was doing a phenomenal job and that I picked the job up much quicker than most (which makes sense with my prior experience). Then without warning, was called into the office and fired without reason. You will have no job security if you work here. Managment is playing with students and employee's lives, all in the name of making more money for Sullivan. I declined a promotion at my previous institution to come work at Sullivan. If you work at Sullivan, you are just a number, nothing more. Don't expect to keep a job here if you don't plan on using their predatory practices to recruit underprivilege students. Naturally, the enrollment goals are unrealistic (the following numbers were told to me by my supervisor). Sullivan University's enrollment was at an all-time low prior to (not because of) COVID of approximately 1900 and they want to double that number to over 4000 within the next couple years (currently at low 2000s) without the willingness to improve the education. Additionally, comments were made about my physical appearance by a former dean that made me feel deeply uncomfortable. To give a little context, I am a young male, and the former dean is a much older female. On multiple occasions, she made remarks about my appearance that made me very shocked, uncomfortable and unwanted. If the roles were reversed (an older, male superior making comments about a younger, female worker) it would be deemed highly inappropriate."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Pay", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 May 2023", "job_title": "Admissions Specialist in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Had some nice people to work with.", "cons": "Management was not very nice."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Structured but unsatisfying", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Enrollment Coordinator in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Good place to work if you like processes being followed (this may have changed since 2020) -responsive HR team -Education benefits", "cons": "-Low pay -expensive, minimal health benefits -unrealistic and unreasonable goals for Admissions team"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Don't do it", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Admissions Officer in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not many pros to share aside from the occasional satisfaction of helping a truly dedicated student complete their enrollment.", "cons": "Questionable sales practices bordering on unscrupulous.

Calling the students constantly to ask them to send us documents and payments only frustrates and stresses them out. The only helpful service we offer students is 7 free sessions with a school counselor. -Admissions is a sales based role where they try their hardest to get students to enroll and do that by misleading students that we offer services that we don't actually offer. Students have been mislead into thinking that the career services department helps current students, it only helps graduates. Students have been mislead that certain credits will transfer when they will not. I understand why Admissions does this, their job is threatened if they do not meet numbers. -No forgiveness for students. I've often had to harass students to get me transcripts that are ridiculous to request. Several students will have college degrees but will be allowed to attend one Quarter just to be told that they can't come back until they have their High School Diploma. Why does a student need to give us their HS if they have college? Some students have come from war torn, poor countries and can not provide a high school transcript. One student has even explained that their \"former high school is rubble\". -I've often seen coworkers and middle management bend over backwards and jump through hoops to help a student, but often be shot down because of dated policies from the big wigs. -As crazy as it sounds, I feel bad for middle management, an insane amount of unrealistic expectations is pushed onto their shoulders and plate, so I don't take it personally when that is trickled down. -Inconsistent workload.

Many former and current staff have legitimate back pay issues.\r\n- Uncertain future.  Enrollment is down system-wide, hence the multiple January 2013 layoffs.  Also the system is constantly at odds with local, state, and federal levels of government, so it attracts political pressure to add to the already existing economic strain.\r\n- Sloppy management. Performance reviews aren't conducted regularly. Policies often change from week to week. Schedules aren't usually reliable. Employees arrive late, leave early, and take long lunches on the clock without consequence.\r\n- Blatant favoritism.  One group is told a lie to justify an injustice, then management contradicts itself to justify preferential treatment of another group months later.\r\n- Almost as many bosses as there are subordinates. (How can you truly be a \"director\" when you only \"direct\" 1-3 people at any given time? Who's the boss?)\r\n- Health insurance premiums are too high relative to the plans' benefits. Most healthy, single people are better off with individual insurance.\r\n- HR serves the corporate interest exclusively. That arm of the university is not impartial. The defensive attitude that it defaults to is unfair to employees.\r\n- No child care even though Sullivan trains child care providers.\r\n- You will be exposed to toxic chemicals in poorly ventilated work areas for entire work days many times a year because Corporate chooses not to do work of this nature on Sundays when campus is empty.

Again, LOL nope. On the first day of \"training\" (in quotations because it was 2 or 3 days of half-assed tutorials about stuff that barely related to the job) we were informed that we would be expected to make 100+ outbound calls per day, and that many times these calls were almost like cold-calling (inquiries were bought from a company who used less than reputable means to get them - many people thought they were applying for a job, not giving us their info).\r\n\r\nWe were constantly pressured to get more applications, regardless of whether it was in the best interest of the student. Well, I take that back - they would \"say\" that we should only offer applications to \"qualified applicants\" who were a good fit, then if we became picky with who we chose, we were berated for not getting more of our interviews to apply. There were constant threats of losing our jobs if we did not get more applications.\r\n\r\nI felt very uncomfortable admitting people to college who were barely qualified to do it (even though the school itself is a joke - but that's another story), especially because the programs were so outrageously expensive ($50,000 for an associates degree?!) and the salary outlooks for those programs often maxed out at $13/hr. \r\n\r\nI believe the Sullivan University System preys on the low-income and disadvantaged, taking their money and happily putting them into massive debt they will never get out of, without any concerns for the long-term futures of these students. \r\n\r\nI ultimately quit because I refuse to compromise my integrity, and the more I learned about my job and about the SUS, the more I realized that was what I was expected to do every day."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Wouldn't recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employee tuition program is a great benefit, although you must last for at least one year to enroll and then another 18 months (at full-time status) to complete your graduate degree.
