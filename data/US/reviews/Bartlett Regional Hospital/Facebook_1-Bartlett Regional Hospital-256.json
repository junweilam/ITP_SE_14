They worked hard at it and I think they were achieving their goals. The last couple of years I was working their the CEO had changed a couple of times due to how the board hired the CEO so there was a bit of instability due to that. Yet I thoroughly enjoyed working with the entire staff at the hospital. It was like a family and they really took top interest in making sure the patient was taken well care of in all aspects of their care (physician care, nursing, social work, diagnostic, therapies, etc) for both inpatient and outpatient services. Maternity services were phenomenal as I was a patient there during my years of employment. My children also had a few visits to the Emergency services and I was very pleased with how they cared for my children.", "cons": "I think because of the hospital board changing how they hire the CEO and the movement of an interim and even a new CEO out of the hospital within a year and a half period, it created a little instability.
