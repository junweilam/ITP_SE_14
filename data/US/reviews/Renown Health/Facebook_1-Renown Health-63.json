During my orientation, the instructor of one of my mandatory classes stated, \"I know Renown has a reputation for not supporting their nurses legally, but that's why we write policies.\" It is hard to follow their policies when you're severely understaffed with high acuity patients. If nurses forgot to chart something, the expectation was that I would have to come back into work within 24 hours or you would receive disciplinary action. MANY MANY requirements outside of your 3 scheduled shifts. I felt like I was working non-stop. Between my scheduled 3 shifts, on call shifts, meetings, eLearning, and mandatory class requirement, I felt like I never got a break. Vacation is almost never approved, and you can't cash out your PTO.

As a nurse they'll tell you that you'll average 4 patients at a time like most hospitals in the area, but 6 and 7 patients is very, very common. They're notorious for burning out their nurses.\r\n\r\nHR department is horrible - They're slow to set up initial interviews (probably under-staffed) then they seem to get involved in nit-picky \"rule violations\" that are applied selectively. I avoided them for the most part, but I witnessed the HR department target other employees.

You lose earned vacation when you leave. Every other employer I've worked for paid you for vacation days you earned but didn't use upon leaving, but Renown doesn't.
