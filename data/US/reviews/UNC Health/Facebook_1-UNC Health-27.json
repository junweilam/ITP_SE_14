New employees are trained by whichever employee happens to be covering the position they are to be trained on. No regard is taken as to the skill and knowledge of the training employee. This essentially leads to 20 different ways of doing a single task, which eventually leads to mistakes.\r\n-Even though housekeeping came through twice a day, the facilities were disgusting. It needed much more than a sweep and occasional mopping. \r\n-I expected a cutting edge, state of the art facility. What I found was a place stuck in the past, and unwilling to make changes to keep pace. When I was hired, in 2002, I was told of plans for development and improvement. When I left, 8 years later, those same plans were still being discussed. \r\n-Upper management's lack of knowledge of departmental operations. They tend to just see things in the \"big picture\", or like the way ideas sound on paper. They seemed to ignore the opinions of those actually working those ideas. I expect anyone in a leadership position to know the job of those they are writing the rules for, so well, that at anytime they could walk in and perform that job at a superior level\r\n\r\nI am not a disgruntled employee, nor did I leave this organization on bad terms. Many things within the department only started to decline within the past couple of years. My opinions of my workplace for the first six years were outstanding. I felt appreciated, respected, and looked forward going to work everyday. There was not a single point or change that occurred that triggered this downturn, it was a slow progression.
