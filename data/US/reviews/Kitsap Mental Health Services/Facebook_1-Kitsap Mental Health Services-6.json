Silos exist which prohibit staff members from communicating or coordinating with each other.  All such communication and coordination must go through the top management level of each silo.  Services are often provided in a manner that is not reimbursable to the agency.   Due to financial mismanagement (continuing to expand without the revenue or funding to do so), KMHS found itself $4+ million dollars in the red.  This resulted in austerity measures, including layoffs of many valuable employees.  These layoffs were handled very poorly, with a great deal of secrecy.  The layoff was a surprise attack on June 15th.  Staff were whisked away from their offices and informed that they were being laid off, and were not even allowed to return to their desks to collect the personal property until after hours, as if they had been fired for cause.  Other austerity measures include major cuts to benefits, including a 500% increase in the monthly premium charged to staff for health insurance.  This will be a big impact on paychecks."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Innovative, compassionate, and community oriented", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Manager in Bremerton, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have worked at KMHS for over 10 years.
