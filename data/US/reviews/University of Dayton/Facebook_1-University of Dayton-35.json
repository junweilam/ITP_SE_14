IEP instructors teach 5 entire terms in one calendar year, leading to rapid burnout and disengagement from students. It's terribly difficult to build the relationships with students (which is crucial according to our Marianist mission) when the very design of the program inhibits this goal. Over time, there has been increasing distrust between IEP faculty and management that stems from increasing control over course design and assessment. IEP faculty are constantly \"asked\" to serve on committees without any additional compensation. When these committees are headed by managers, the committee members have little to no control over decision-making. Ultimately, decisions in this program are made by management with little regard for how the decisions affect faculty. Because of this, distrust and resentment continue to grow while the management determines that the problem comes from teachers who just want to complain and need to learn how to be grateful for their jobs. In terms of job promotion, there is no possibility of promotion as an IEP instructor. You are either an instructor or a manager.
