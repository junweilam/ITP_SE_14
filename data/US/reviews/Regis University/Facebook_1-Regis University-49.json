They are trying to look under every rug to find a student. We are becoming a for profit institution.

They held a large scholarship event promising students money to only turn around and say \u201cno we won\u2019t give anyone money\u201d until faculty gets upset. They give away pity little amounts to try and make themselves look good. What a joke. The head \u201chauncho\u201d in charge is not a nice person. He doesn\u2019t care about anyone else\u2019s time but his and will work you to death just to try and make himself look good for the board of trustees and president. This is a guy that literally does nothing but work and work and even told several of us how proud he is of what he does and even missed his children\u2019s birthdays and their school events because his ego is that big! I have a family that I value and I value the time I get to spend with them. However, now this person is wanting people to work weekends (staff that don\u2019t even work in Admissions). This wasn\u2019t in my job description when I started. Do we have to use our vacation time on the weekends now? Is that now a requirement? If you look at this place, please please please look elsewhere. There is a major employee turnover problem and student retention is low. They care about their numbers and getting people in the door, but lose their \u201ccare\u201d about them once they start the academic year. I\u2019m not stating my role for fear of retaliation because I believe it would go that far with the current person in charge. The guy had a 22 page resume! He goes from job to job and will leave any prior institution a wreck. The board of trustees is just to blame for hiring such a careless and cold hearted individual. To add a cherry on top, there is no cost of living increases. I can barely afford to work. They did a measly compensation study to find they underpaid employees yet even after their little study, they still underpay you! If you enjoy your life, look elsewhere. As a former undergraduate student in Regis College with a now MBA and employee, I\u2019ve seen this place go so far down hill I don\u2019t think it can save itself. The reputation has been tarnished.

As an added bonus too, they will also not raise compensation for cost of living, which is sky high in the Denver metro area. The school also has a major employee and student retention problem.
