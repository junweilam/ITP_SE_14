A few months after returning to work following maternity leave, I suffered from postpartum depression. As a woman, it's always a concern to go to a male boss about needing time off for something related to child-rearing or mental health. However, I was met with nothing but support, words of encouragement, and the promise that my job was there when I was ready to return. The university president and vice president promoted my mental health and my family before the university. It would have been effortless for them to replace me and meet the needs of the university; after all, I was a faculty member suddenly in need of time off that left them with one less instructor each term. Instead, they maintained my position, and when I sent a simple email stating I was ready to return, they immediately put me back on their schedule, and I picked right back up where I had left off. \r\nI will always promote ECPI University as a fantastic place to work; I recommend it to any aspiring professor.", "cons": "If you prefer a set schedule, this may not be the environment for you. Due to the fast-paced nature of the degree programs, course schedules change every five weeks. As a faculty member, you have to be okay with your course schedule changing every five weeks to meet the needs of the term schedules."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Na", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "29 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Roanoke, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work environment.

I was lucky enough to build decent relationships with my co-workers who have been supportive and guided me through the how-to's of laying low so management doesn't rip your head off. For ECPI, production and progress are never enough- so get ready to be demeaned and put down! Higher management speaks extremely disrespectfully to their employees and does not believe in the concept of reward for good performance. They truly do not value their employees and consider people as numbers. Most people would expect basic inflation pay raises so they can AT LEAST live within their means- nope. High-performing employees will receive the same raise as the lowest-performing employee. They are typically always short-staffed and do not hire anyone new so they can save a buck- then the current employees are expected to do more so that they can accommodate the business, but never for more pay and NEVER are praised for going above expectations. During COVID it became evident that they were not concerned for their employees getting sick or being around the general public. Those that had to be home in 2021 had to take their PTO to be home (still were expected to work) because they were afraid when a global pandemic was happening and their family members were falling ill and going to the hospital..??? Major communication issues occur between departments constantly. If you are not at your desk the full 8.5-9 hours of the work day you are \"not working\" and this has to be addressed. For special circumstances you need to take pto (funerals, doctor's appts, mental health needs) other employees have to cover your \"shift\" and if there is not coverage you can not take take off. It is not the staff's responsibility to cover where the business will not staff appropriately. This needs to be fixed. The most frustrating part of working here was trying to stay open-minded and positive about the position. Annual reviews are encouraged by the highest management to only give menial numbers so that they don't have to pay their employees more- even if they are going above and beyond expectations. pretty pathetic they can't read a basic management manual to be a decent leader. Staff also needs to be a bit more diversified for the diverse student population it attracts. work hours are crazy long and have switched schedules. work life balance is awful."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Flexible, but that's all.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Federal Work Study in Virginia Beach, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loved working there, but the onboarding was terrible.

You will have to work Saturdays and be compelled to lie to potential students the same way you were lied to when you applied for this job.  You will be told by \"management\" how to teach and more importantly how to grade classes that you are the expert in.  You will be lied to about management personnel changes and school name changes.  You will have zero academic freedom but that doesn't really matter because you will have zero time between 5-week long, 5 hour-a-day courses to prepare anything because you aren't told what course you will be teaching until the day before it starts.  You will get no breaks during said 5-hour courses because it is your duty to call absent adult students during your \"break\" and lie to them about the importance of coming to this school that only cares about getting their financial aid checks.  What's really awesome is that you will have to teach a full course even if there are only 2 students enrolled in it.  If there is only 1 student enrolled in a course then ECPI doesn't hold the course...WRONG!  You get to teach that one student on your own time and we'll just call it \"independent study\".

However, you will surely be told that you are at fault for why that student lacks the tools to be successful in your course.  You will always be presumed wrong when matters of judgement arise because if a student  walks, there goes the financial aid checks with them so it is better to blame the faculty.

Then perhaps the fact that the \"leadership\" is horrible; they run everything as though their only priority is to create metrics to justify that they aren't doing bad enough to shut down the university. Internally leadership only vies for trackable data collection that creates the illusion of success. Collecting enough surveys can skew the data enough that they create false outcomes. It's like the university is run by an evil Bond villain. Management essentially has to interviews and hire constantly, because they cant keep good faculty with the way they manage. They hemorrhage good instructors and then fill the gaps with adjuncts they keep just long enough to maintain classes. What's weird is they make it a secrete when instructors leave the university so they avoid addressing the question of why half a department quits. Even when that happens it simply spreads the responsibility around; this is when they make up meaningless titles to lull you you into accepting more and more responsibility without compensation. 1 less instructor doesn't mean there is an impact on the classes offered, it just means other instructors have to fill in to the detriment of the students. There has never been a more inappropriate approach to education- they think it's a marathon (and not the slow and steady type of approach), every 5 weeks without pause. No time between terms end and start to even know what classes your scheduled for come the next weeks start. Education isn't a race to the finish. Like others have commented, the staff and leadership celebrate the successes of the instructors without so much as nod to the efforts they contribute. \r\n They schedule classes without actually having the classroom space or instructors to run them, why? because they need to keep billing students. It is the mindset that any day a student misses class or needs a break from the 5 week term schedule, that it is an opportunity for them to lose that students and really it's about losing that tuition payment.  In their view any instructor can teach any class regardless of whether they are qualified or even familiar with the course content. Campus leadership are micro-managers that are truly horrible autocratic monsters- the stuff* rolls downhill is literally their motto. It sound like an exaggeration, but it's not. It's not about quality to the university, it's about passing more students, faster, and with less. Instructors are forced to baby students, and if they don't pass because they violate attendance or don't submit work it is the instructors fault. If they miss a class they demand instructors call the student- when you might ask? In a class of 20-30 students that  lasts 4.5 hours when and why should an instructor have to call a student who is an adult supposedly taking college courses? well the why is, as I've heard it, as soon as you have a 5 minute break (because breaks aren't for you! they're for the students), and the why is because maybe they over slept or forgot, which is not the fault or responsibility of a university instructor, but rather the student. The admissions departments cherry pick veterans for the ease of the GI bill regardless of whether they have the aptitude to succeed- just pass them is the mindset of several students and campus leaders. If you don't it's your fault as an instructor. The culture imparted by campus leadership is that of group shaming and micromanagement- they will send reports in mass emails to all faculty with details about individual instructors classes to create an environment of uncertainty and interpersonal shaming. They convince some that they are expected to work above 42 hrs per week as a standard, and as many others have noted, they throw any schedule at you that they need to charge students that term to keep them paying. It doesn't matter if that is back to back classes with no more than 10 minutes between 4.5 hr courses. It could be what they call a \"split shift\" that amounts to 15 hour days by assigning a morning class 7 am-12 pm followed by a 6 pm-10:30 pm course. you could be assigned to be the first one in and last out by assigning a night class immediately followed by a morning class, regardless of how this impacts the instructor- YOU DON'T MATTER, THEY WONT CARE, and the business model is designed as such so they can trick new hires to contribute to course development only to then burn them out and hire new ones yet again. Squeeze employees for all they can be used for and dispose of them. Someone they don't understand that supporting the instructors benefits the students. They would never offer a word of kindness or show an ounce of appreciation, but MAN if they don't use their instructors as a selling point to students! They tell students how dedicated and knowledgeable instructors are to get them admitted, then at every opportunity tell instructors they aren't  doing enough, fast enough, and with less. Instructors do care about the students success, but are not facilitated or acknowledged for these efforts, in fact they essentially institutionalize the business model of never allowing an instructor to think they are ever doing a good job. Even if they have to make things up to do so they will accuse instructors of not having enough student engagement or not contributing/volunteering enough for events that do not benefit students and directly cause a detriment to students since these events often are at the expense of having time to grade or help them. This is a horrible university that creates a hostile work environment every day and invests nothing in their instructors, in fact they really believe you should feel fortunate to be employed at all, they're doing everyone a favor. Dedicated faculty are treated worse than adjuncts, who are part time and often have no experience educating and no motivation to waist the time. Granted many adjuncts are great, but many are hired simply to be a resource to throw in front of students under prepared and qualified. There in they find a shield; terminate an instructor if a student complains, or if outcomes aren't good enough, but don't bother considering that it is entirely their approach that creates the problem. DON\"T WORK HERE, and if your hired as an adjunct you are merely a part of the problem, part of the reason they feel they have no responsibility for full time instructors. Adjuncts are provided better schedules than full time faculty and you would assume just the opposite- but no they rationalize it as them being part time and thereby having other responsibilities...as in not to the students! or the school!

No private area to talk individually with students.  Students are very entitled and will not hesitate to go the administrators or president  if they do not like an instructor or do not get their way on even small matters. There is no back-up for instructors, whatever the student says is the way it is.  Remember, this is a for profit school so the idea is to keep students  no matter what for revenue.  Even student who clearly need to fail the program are allowed to continue, leaving faculty feeling frustrated  and having no control of standards. \r\n\r\n  Faculty leave frequently out of frustration, which leaves the remaining members having to cover extra clinical and courses.  Faculty are often teaching courses totally out of their specialty at a moments notice. Schedules and student rosters are not  given to the instructors often until the  first day of the course.   The RN faculty may be required to cover clinical for the PN program without  prior notice.  This leads to continuous over-working conditions and fatigue.  Pay is not  reflective of the workload.  This is a year round program with very limited  time of for holidays.  Faculty members who are full-time salaried employees are required to clock-in and clock-out  as if the are hourly workers and are not paid for any work done at home , which is common due to the workload.  \r\n\r\nNursing administrators  have no administration experience . They were moved from faculty positions to DON, ADON positions having no background or preparation for the role causing chaos.  Textbooks are changed without warning . A faculty member may not get the new textbook until the day the course begins leading to faculty members being unprepared for their courses. This intern leads to student dissatisfaction with the instructors and poor evaluations for their performance.  Because student satisfaction is priority faculty members are put in impossible  situations with poor outcomes that are beyond their control.   They are then told they must make the students happier as if they are not quality instructors.  If it were not for the exceptional quality of the faculty , who care about providing  excellent nursing education the pass rates on the NCLEX for MCI would not be as high as it is.
