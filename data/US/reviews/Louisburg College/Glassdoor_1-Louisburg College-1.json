Getting to be a part of that process, even a small one, can be extremely fulfilling, as far as occupations go.", "cons": "I worked in the business office. I'm going to keep this as short as I reasonably can while still capturing what I experienced.\r\n\r\nDuring my relatively brief employment, I watched as a uniquely toxic CFO drove half of the department away. We were gutted because she had nitpicked, bullied, ignored, harassed, manipulated, scapegoated, or just outright lied to everybody she regularly worked over. Because of her poor leadership, those who remained were forced to take on double and sometimes triple roles. Eventually, and for the past two months, I was all that was left between the students and the accounting side of the office. Me, who had been hired four months prior, received scant training, had spent two of those months bouncing between offices to fill gaps, and had absolutely no direct experience prior to starting this job.\r\n\r\nI could go into extensive details on the level of malfeasance and abuse happening at this institution, much less the absolutely callous and neglectful attitude the administration takes towards its students, the real victims of the school. But it suffices to say that I was terminated in retaliation for alerting the authorities to the financial abuses the school and its administration are guilty of. I alerted the authorities because I'd gone as high up the chain as I could within, and was merely met with the smug, disinterested stare of a big fish in a shockingly small pond. The retaliation took the form of an escalation of blame directed towards me. At one point, I was blamed for a parent being upset because my supervisor lost a check. That was a fun moment.\r\n\r\nShould you apply for any of their business office or financial aid positions, here's what you can expect:\r\n- Constant gaslighting. The CFO will regularly lie to your face.\r\n- Overwork. You will be asked to do the work your boss just doesn't feel like doing. Sometimes, she may even go so far as to subvert a previously-decided strategy with absolutely no warning and in doing so create vastly more work for you and render obsolete the work you had been doing.\r\n- Undercompensation. One of my colleagues left after 5.5 years, routinely promised raises that were never delivered. She was also denied a bonus that was conveniently announced the day she put in her two-weeks notice. Oh, and a culture of wage opacity. They really don't like it when you look up publicly available information.\r\n- Questionable ethical demands. The CFO prefers verbal communication. She balked at my request that we conduct our exchanges via documentary means. She will admit to or ask you to do illegal and unethical things, and then lie about saying those things, and then deflect to blame you for something, which is...\r\n- Scapegoating! If her accounts receivable is too high, that's your fault so you better have a good explanation. She's going to ask you for it in the five minutes before she hurries up to the cabinet meeting and has to nervously explain herself.\r\n- Zero training. I'm not there anymore to do it, and I barely knew what I was doing, which I tried to make as clear as possible. And, due to the CFO's utter aversion to documentation, protocol, and procedure, there's going to be basically nothing for you to work from. Good luck?\r\n- Insufficient communication. Weekly staff meetings vanished, the CFO is frequently unavailable and responds to digital communication sparingly.\r\n- Bullying, condescension, and disrespect, if you're a woman.\r\n- The deeply distressing combination that is all of the above along with a Human Resources department that seems dead set on protecting the most destructive individual in the institution, save for maybe the president himself, Dr. Gary Brown."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It was a good company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Hub Assembly and Quality in Youngsville, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The hours were good working there", "cons": "Traveling up and down flights of steps with trash cans"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "An educational experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Instructor in Louisburg, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Louisburg has a great mission, strong ideals, and a close-knit community.
