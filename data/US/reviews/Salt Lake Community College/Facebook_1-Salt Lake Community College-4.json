You can just search us in local paper headlines. \n- Insert highly ethically questionable nature of employing primarily adjunct teaching force here. \n- Like most higher education institutions, SLCC is not interested in operating efficiently. Rather than a single institution moving towards an end, the college is a series of self-interested slow-moving silos fighting for resources in a dying industry and it is not pretty to watch.

There have been a lot of positive changes in leadership the past two years. The new president seems to truly care about the importance of having an affordable two year transfer college as well as vocational programs for those who are not seeking a transfer degree and would rather quickly join into the workforce. There seems to be a positive feeling of community among the employees over all, though it is impossible to avoid politics altogether. Amazing benefits for full time employees if you are able to find a full time position. The college is very dedicated to access, success, diversity and inclusivity. It creates a very positive environment for students and employees over all.", "cons": "SLCC runs primarily on part time employment and getting a full time position can take a very long time. Five years ago part time employees were able to accrue PTO, at a lower rate than full time staff, but it still helped keep finances stable during holidays or when you were sick. A part time staff member would have to work at SLCC for three years before gaining this benefit, so it was really set in place for individuals who were dedicated to the institution. This policy was done away with by the old SLCC president and still has not been reinstated despite change in leadership. Pay for part timers is not very competitive, but employment at SLCC provides opportunity to gain a variety of transferable skills and experience. Despite the challenges that come with being a part time employee at SLCC many people stay for a long time because they love their coworkers and the overall environment. I felt very lucky to finally get into a full time position."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Slow, mundane, and favoring particular people hinders progress.
