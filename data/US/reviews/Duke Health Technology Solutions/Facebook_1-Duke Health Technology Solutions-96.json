You can be a manager that wants to help improve things, but upper leadership will shut them down and make them feel like they have no say over their own team.\r\n\r\nManagers fighting with other managers for higher positions. Which later hurts the people that's under them. If one manager doesn't like another, it feels like that manager will give the other manager's employee a hard time. \r\n\r\nUpper leadership don't know how to keep great talent but promote yes men workers. \r\n\r\nUpper leadership don't have a true mission, it's all about profit. \r\n\r\nThere are more managers than workers.\r\n\r\nTeamwork is very weak.\r\n\r\nLeadership is okay with other teams dumping their work on the service desk and field techs.

They are too cheap to invest in Level 1 Support to work on-site, so they send their Tier 2 and Tier 3 Engineers to work on-site. That's right. You have a CCIE? Great, you're still going onsite to replace a cable at 1:00 am. Made plans for the weekend? Cancel that, you need to go swap an AP. Tryna go to sleep at 11:00 PM? Nope, a router went down, and you're working til 3:00 AM and still with the expectation to work again at 8:00 am.\n\nRoom For Growth: There is no room for growth. They will lead you on with hope of advancements, and recommend you gain new skills and pursue advanced certifications. Next thing you know, they're just throwing more work at you with no promotion or raise. You will remain on the same level/pay but with far more work.\n\nSalary: Here's the funny part. I thought I had a low salary, at 75K. Before leaving, my coworkers disclosed their salaries. They were all in the 60K range, and they had been working for years longer than me. They will spend millions of dollars on network equipment, but underpay the heck out of their employees. \n\nManagement Style: You will be extremely micromanaged. Every task you work on has a timer that gets activated when you click on it. At the end of day your timers are expected to sum up to 8 hours or higher. If not, they will be on your case about it.\n\nThe manager is an absolute narcissist. He will ask you questions, answer his own questions, and then determine the plan of action for you. If you dare to have an opinion, he will make sure to assert his dominance. He will do so by raising his voice, micromanaging, and assigning you tasks that are very tedious.
