Most higher level staff do not trust mid-level staff to produce materials and there are endless review cycles up the chain of command. Staff are also discouraged from having opinions. It is all about executing what senior level staff think without question. Errors are not tolerated. While there are opportunities to be promoted, they come with no training on management and the organization suffers as a result. Certain senior-level staff just coast by since they have been at NCQA for over 6 years before the PCMH profit bubble. There is no accountability on supervisors and while you will receive a performance review with a subjective rating system there is NO opportunity to evaluate your supervisors. \r\n\r\nStaff morale is at the lowest it has been and turnover is rampant throughout all levels of the organization.

I'm from one of those departments, but to be fair, my direct supervisor usually acknowledges good work and constructively responds to less than stellar performance, even when their manager treats them like garbage.\r\n\r\nAside from workload issues, interactions with upper management in some departments can be downright ugly. They all have their own agendas and their own opinions on everything from the interpretation of company policy to the exact order of presentation slides.
