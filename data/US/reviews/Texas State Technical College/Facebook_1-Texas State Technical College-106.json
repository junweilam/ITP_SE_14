It was so bad that my direct manager quit, 3 of my recruiters quit, I was forced to fire people, and my VP recommended I fire someone because he wasn\u2019t moving fast enough (which is weird because he still currently employed there). Eventually, I was fired for some dumb reason even though I put in nearly 3 years of my life towards this campus. They have high expectations for the person in this role (expect you to do mid senior to senior level work at an entry level salary), give no training, & yell at you the minute you make a mistake. When I was there, the Recruitment department was full of people who hate their job. It created such a toxic working environment. You\u2019ll have people at other campuses that swear up and down it\u2019s the best place to work\u2026don\u2019t believe them. Most of them have never had any other job other than a job at TSTC. It\u2019s a sink or swim mentality, full of entitled fake Karens and Kens (literally)\u2026 not a diverse statewide campus at all. They tried to improve their diversity by hiring more people of color, but those people of color they hire tend to quit because they don\u2019t survive the toxicity of that place. One my direct manager said \u201cthere are a lot of black people at the Fort Bend campus\u201d\u2026 *Shakes head* Also, very little room to move up or grow in salary. Annual pay was 37k when I was initially hired and then moved to 42k only because a previous HR person (who eventually quit because it was so bad) fought for our salary and demanded it be increased due to market pay. This has been a long battle considering a lot of the senior employees at other campuses refused to see FB employees make more money than them with less years put in. Turnover rate here is HIGH. Saw this position posted 3 times since I\u2019ve left in 2017, so that speaks for itself. STAY AWAY from this place unless the leadership in the Recruitment department changes. \r\n\r\nAlso, when my father died, I only had 2 days of emergency leave with pay\u2026 the rest of my time off I used vacation days.
