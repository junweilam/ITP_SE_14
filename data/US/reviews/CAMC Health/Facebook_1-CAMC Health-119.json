If you're a contract worker (which a lot of the managers seem to be) you do, but if you work just for CAMC you do not. If you get sick it counts as an \"occasion\" unless you show up for work on time and stay for half of your shift. You may get 3 occasions in 6 months, if you get a 4th occasion in 6 months you can get fired on the spot. Doesn't matter if you have doctors notes, doesn't matter if you were in one of CAMC's own ERs, you will get an occasion. If your boss/employee health will let you take a couple days off it will come out of any PTO you may have saved up, if you have no PTO to use you won't be paid while sick. I understand the reasoning, but when you work with the public, especially in a hospital, you'd think they'd want legitimately sick people to stay home. So, everyone works sick, gets everyone else in the department sick and the cycle repeats every few weeks. And no, I didn't get fired for sick days, I almost never took a sick day, but the whole process is flawed and they make you feel like you're a little kid holding a thermometer to a lightbulb to get out of school even when you're literally in their ER with an IV drip.\n\nTheir interdepartmental communication is terrible\n\nThe buildings are falling apart\n\nThey have a lot of shady practices when it comes to billing patients. Fairly common practice for the billing department to say they'll work out payments with low-income patients only to turn them over to a collections agency instead\n\nSide note-y, but is a perfect example of upper management's general behavior, I recently found out the health insurance company they use (Bluecross Blueshield) is involved in a lawsuit for making \"secret deals\" with other insurance companies to keep premiums high. I asked a couple of my former co-workers if CAMC had told them about the lawsuit that's going on, big surprise, CAMC hadn't informed anyone there about the problem with their insurance company."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Hurricane, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay benefits structure code team", "cons": "Environmen.
