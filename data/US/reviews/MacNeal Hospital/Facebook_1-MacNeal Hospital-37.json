Kathy Mikos does not support nursing staff, she treats hard working nurses with disrespect. She does not like nurses who have a voice. The same goes for the new extremely unprofessional addition to MacNeal administration Jen Grenier, she is an embarrassment as a leader. She also talks to staff in such a degrading manner. The combination of these two has and will continue to hurt moral all across the hospital. \r\nNurses have a role to advocate for their patients, however these two have made it clear they will not support their staff. If nurses dare to voice opinions or concerns, termination can and will happen, without any warning. \r\nManagers are no longer a resource of support, cause they too will face termination in attempts to support and validate nursing concerns. \r\nThese two would rather have compassionless and incompetent nurses who don't have a voice than a caring knowledgable nurse who voices her concerns and advocates for her patients. These two would rather have a hospital filled with new grads who don't know any better, who don't have enough experience to see right and wrong of higher ups. New grads are great, but without strong competent passionate nurses, what example will new grads have? The one who suffers the most is the patient. Kathy and Jen prove every day, that is none of their concern.\r\n Kathy and Jen don't know how to support nurses. \r\nKathy and Jen are anything but leaders.\r\nIn this time of global crisis, support is needed now more than ever. But what does Jen do, she goes to units and harasses nurses for wearing a surgical mask. Nurses need to protect themselves. Nurses/doctors/evs are all being exposed directly and indirectly. If nurses don't protect themselves the patient is the one who will suffer. Every day, every hour, the \"recommendation\"  for proper ppe for covid-19 is changing. Having Kathy and Jen as leaders is more disheartening than the fear of this virus itself. Kathy and Jen are profoundly immoral and wicked to their staff. The combination of these two as leaders during a global crisis like covid-19 will only result in harm to staff and the patients being cared for."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Interesting", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Jan 2013", "job_title": "Laundry in Berwyn, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits were a plus.
