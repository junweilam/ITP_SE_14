There were multiple outbreaks of COVID, and a lot of the times it felt like they were secretive about things and didn\u2019t give employees a heads up in case they had been exposed to the virus. \r\n\r\nThis was the last nail in the coffin for me. Keiser did not care about me, my health, my growth, nothing. \r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019m grateful that they gave me the opportunity to begin my career there as a new grad, my hard work and all the effort I put in to do a good job and help students did not feel appreciated. Some managers can also be EXTREMELY toxic and unprofessional. \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re thinking of working at admissions, look at it as a way to make some money while you look for something better. No one in that department is your friend. They will smile and be friendly, but will turn on you as soon as doing so is convenient.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking to work in FA, just know that they are super understaffed, and the starting salary for the position hasn\u2019t gone up in years. You might also end up working under some very unreasonable managers who want to overwork you as much as possible for little pay. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think Keiser might be ok as a first job. Don\u2019t come in expecting to have a career. It\u2019s very difficult to grow and you won\u2019t get anything more than 3-4% raises even if you are a star employee. It\u2019s a job you could stay in for about a year while you get some professional experience, but please please please don\u2019t waste more than a couple of years hoping to grow or get very far."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great hours but no personal time off", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Faculty Member in Miami, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The hours and day to day were fantastic.

They don't make as many phone calls at the admissions counselors. One of the senior admissions counselors was extremely sexist (I will spare you the examples). He would come in early before everyone else and sort through the leads so he could get the easy appointments or walk in leads. The senior admissions counselor thought he was the mobster of Keiser. Other counselors would say \"Oh you don't want to get on his bad side\". He also had a filthy mouth and complained about the smell of the admissions counselor lunches. He just wasn't used to healthy smelling food. He would constantly bully admissions counselors and had a problem when admissions counselors would speak with a student that was assigned to him, even  thought he made zero effort in contacting the student. \r\n-The counselors have filthy mouths. One counselor said she would announce to the whole office when someone defecated on the first floor bathroom.\r\n-The office has a huge race problem. They don't like \"vanilla\". \r\n-One counselor told me I am \"lucky\" to have such a \"great job\" at my age. They don't like young people. \r\n-I worked seven holidays in a row, this was a \"gift\" from the director because during the holidays no one is working and I would be able to get lots of \"inquiries\" \r\n-The school has such terrible reviews online that students would bring up the reviews during their interview, making it hard to convince them it was a good school. \r\n- Admissions counselors are expected to work two Saturdays a month, stay until 8:00 for orientation, and arrive at 7:30 AM for start days. Despite these hours and mandatory overtime, management has a problem when admissions counselors adjust their schedule by 15 minutes. \r\n-The office is dated, and often has flies back there. It is always hot in the office.\r\n -The computer equipment and headsets is dated. The computers are always slow. \r\n-The instructors view admissions counselors as sleazy sales people. Instructors are always asking what students are signing up for their class/program. \r\n-Not a team environment, everyone gossips about everyone else. Mean jokes about managers. \r\n-The Senior admissions counselor was in charge of PTO, if he felt you weren't \"performing\", he would advise not to take PTO because it would \"hurt\" you. \r\n-Everyone wants to get promoted. Too many captains and not enough sailors. \r\n-President is clueless about what goes on in the admissions office. \r\n-Counselors would fight over inquiries and the directors did not want to get involved, like hello that their job. \r\n-Last, but probably most important, the director was never in the office. She would leave the building for hours at a time and constantly take days off. The team questioned if she was resigning because she was absent so much. She spent more time in the offices of other departments than she would with her own team. It was ironic she would say something about me being 5-6 minutes  late, when she wouldn't come in until 11:30 AM sometimes! She was never in her office when her team needed her. I was \"talked to\" about tweaking my schedule, yet management is not on any time of schedule. It is a joke. \r\n-The whole school seems like a joke, I would never recommend this place to a friend. \r\n-I am glad I left when I did, I wish I left sooner.

They will find plenty of things wrong so they wont have to give you a yearly raise, Benchmarks and goals are 10 enrollments per person a month and they just increased the outbound calls to 75 per person.  \r\n\r\nThe salary is not competitive, everyone starts at 35,000 a year, regardless if u have a masters or not. IIn the past if you worked the graduate program they use to compensate you and pay 40,000 but they no longer do that. They combined the graduate school with the undergraduate school, so who ever they hire for the graduate program will make 35000 now. So the olds school grad counselors make 40000 to near 50000. They were lucky, but now anyone that come on will make 35,000. There are a few senior AC that makes 40-45000. That's about it. However. I hear they are no longer compensating any new senior ac. \r\n\r\n They have tuition reimbursement. But if you take it you will owe the time. Meaning. If you go to school there for two years for free then you have to work an extra two years.  If u leave before then, u will have to pay it back. Also tuition reimbursement doesn't come in effect till one year after and that goes for their 401/3k doesn't come in effect till one yea later too. \r\n\r\nOh my, there medical insurance i high!!! its like 300 a month for one person. If you have insurance with them for two years. Then after 2 full years starting on the 3rd year, the medical insurance i free. But you have to be enrolled in it for 2 full years. And that's if you make it 2 full years which is really 3 years! No one really takes it.\r\n\r\nManagement is horrible. They hire their friends. They have no strategies on how to train their team. All they would like you is get an enrollment so when they have their.start meeting with their doa they have less explaining. Then when the student cancels for some reason they will ride u and lie on you big time!. Yet they encouraged u to enroll them. \r\n\r\nThey have a trainer that was an ADOA who is now a ADOA,.. I wont comment.\r\nThey do have a new trainer that works the floor, she is from another school. She is great. ey \r\n\r\nThey recently hired a new ADOA from another school. That is also great, which I think will bring a lot to the table and be able to train his/her AC's well!!!!\r\n\r\nThey do have a few ADOA's that was hired because, they know upper management  who has no business being an ADOA.. A certain ADOA loves to use scare tactics on their AC's\r\n\r\nWith the proper training I think there may be hope. I also personally think that Dr. Keiser, doesn't know what goes on in Admissions. I am sure, if he did none of what goes on would be happening. \r\n\r\nThat place has so much favoritism and the ADOA's are clueless. and really its not all of the ADOA;s and it wont be hard to find out who... Just ask a few AC's on the floor.
