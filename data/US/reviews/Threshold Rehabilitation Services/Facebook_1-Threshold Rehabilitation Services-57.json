Company wants to appear good on paper and they stress the importance of consumers/clients rights, but its a bunch of bull. Consumers/clients rights are never considered when its the company making a decision. Benefits are not that great and pay raises are the minimum and inconsistent, some new hires were starting at pay rates higher than employees who had been with the company 10+ years or more.  The company does not value its employees, you are seen as replaceable and can and will be fired for petty things if they don't like you. They never  take into consideration the  number of years with company, or the care and compassion one provides to the clients.  Its almost as if they would prefer you to not build relationships with the people you care for and the co-workers you spend so much time with.  Managers are sometimes overworked and never last long.
