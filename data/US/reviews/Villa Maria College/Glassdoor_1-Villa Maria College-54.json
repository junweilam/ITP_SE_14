Since the college has such lax admission standards, many students are quickly overwhelmed with the basics of a college course load.  Luckily, the college offers many remedial opportunities for students to catch up to a college level.  Thus, assuming the student wants to learn, these opportunities present a chance for immediate learning.  That can be a very rewarding experience.", "cons": "While I alluded to the fact that you can make an immediate impact on students, this comes at a price. Admissions criteria are woefully low.  Thus, many students have education levels that would seemingly cause them to struggle at the middle years of a high school.  Moreover, many students do not seem to take their classes serious.  While this may be common around the country, at such high tuition rates, it is clear the time spent at Villa Maria is causing them more harm then good.  It seems in many respects that the college is desperate to maintain admissions numbers.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while I worked at Villa Maria, I noticed several quality employees were forced out by poor administration and nepotistic behavior.  Those who should have a greater impact on school policy are often relegated by those completely inept to make such decisions."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great School", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Buffalo, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Villa Maria College is a small school with good student to faculty ratios", "cons": "adjunct pay is on the low end"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Laborer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "22 Feb 2016", "job_title": " in Lockport, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice boss, decent co-workers.
