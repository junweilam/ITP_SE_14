With few exceptions, they are creative, out-of-the-box thinkers who work very hard to do their best. They seem to appreciate the opportunities given to them, and they seem less entitled than students at other similar institutions.", "cons": "The upper administration takes a very top-down approach to leadership, often dictating their decisions to faculty in faculty meetings. Example: the football fiasco. The upper admin insisted that a football team would help recruitment efforts and, ultimately, bring in more money to the school. A $150,000 'feasibility study' (foregone conclusion: feasible) was conducted, and preparations were made and then scrapped when the economic downturn occurred. This cost the school a lot of money unnecessarily, even when faculty and alumuni were overwhelmingly against the idea of introducing a football team. The upper administration seems, in general, to be engaged in a plot to alter the school's character as a way to attract 'full sticker price'-paying students. Hendrix has traditionally been a haven for creative students, hippie types, and self-avowed \"nerds\" of various sorts (drama to chemistry and everything inbetween) from Arkansas and surrounding states. This \"repositioning in the market\" (words of the President) seems to have everything to do with money and nothing to do with maintaining the quality of academics at Hendrix.\r\n\r\nThe top-down mentality frequently extends to academic departments, where junior faculty feel scared to speak up on departmental or college-wide issues for fear of reprisal from superiors. There is *very* heavy reliance on limited-contract and adjunct instructors, most of whom are as qualified as (if not more than) their tenured colleagues. This has a negative effect on programs, which lack continuity due to the turnover, and ultimately, it deprives students of long-term relationships with their professors, and later in life, with their alma mater when they come back to visit - and yes, this could affect donations later. Don't think it won't.\r\n\r\nThe pay is good, but the opportunity for advancement is non-existent for non-tenure-track (ntt) employees, and there is no one to advocate for their needs because senior faculty do not care, and junior, tenure-track faculty feel afraid to speak up for them. Meanwhile, when one's employment next semester or next year depends on keeping quiet and not rocking the boat, ntt faculty certainly can't speak up for themselves.\r\n\r\nSenior faculty tend to be under- or entirely unpublished and could not get the tenure-track (or perhaps even ntt) positions for which they are in charge of hiring. This has led to much resentment towards younger, beginning faculty who have, in some cases, already published more than the entire senior faculty in their departments *combined.* It's sad, really.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the top-down management (think Bush administration) that bars meaningful faculty input in administrative matters may ultimately lead to a deep-set complacency. The power is concentrated in the upper tiers in all areas of administration and departmental governance, so the problem can only be solved by a complete reorganization and a new attitude. Unfortunately, few people ever give up power voluntarily, so it would take nothing short of a revolution to make that happen."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great place to be a teacher and scholar.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "17 May 2014", "job_title": "Professor in Conway, AR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The teaching load is reasonable (3 courses/semester).
