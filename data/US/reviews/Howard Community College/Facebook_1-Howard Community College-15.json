They revel in meetings and committees, and get little done. Why? Because when everyone is in charge, no one is. Not every problem needs a committee, it just needs someone willing to be accountable to solve the problem. But, as is often the case in Government, no one wants accountability. 3. Shared services like HR and Marketing are really weak. Turnover, low staffing, and a lack of creativity and entrepreneurship is the culprit. 4. No appreciation for the details from management.
