A front page article in the Buffalo News article on 8/3/20 was accurate in terms of the culture and how it is turning very toxic and there has been internal blowback to a few of those who are still employees but spoke out publicly including the president calling a couple them bullies by name at an all hands meeting before the start of Fall 2020 semester. \r\n\r\nThe administration has tried to blame covid after furloughing then firing about 60 people with a couple from almost every department but many of these issues have been building long before. The employees were fired on Columbus Day/Canadian thanksgiving a day the college is officially closed and Channel 2 news knew over 2 hours before the employees themselves were notified. Can't even get that correct. While Covid has caused a decrease in upcoming enrollment the issues with spending were believed by many employees to have started long before.\r\n\r\nPhysical renovations which were much needed but have been taken to the extreme have risked the financial stability of the college and the Board of Trustees seems to have no interest in reigning in the excess this includes a recent purchase of the neighboring church and rectory for 1.2 million during Covid while also building a brand new building. Academic Department budgets are being slashed for the upcoming spring 2021 semester but the renovations have not been scaled back to try to compensate the budget to this point. \r\n\r\nThe dismantling of the Campus Ministry and Mission Integration departments have ensured that the faith based part of the colleges mission no longer has a proverbial seat at the table of presidents council. Mission Integration was created in the name of Sr. Denise the outgoing president with a donation from the order of nuns who founded the college the department no longer exists as its second director left in less than 2 years.
