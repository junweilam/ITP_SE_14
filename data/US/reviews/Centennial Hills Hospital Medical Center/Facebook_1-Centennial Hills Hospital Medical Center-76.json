New-hire conference with the CEO, CNO, CFO, ACNO after your first month to get NEW employee feedback. 5k referral bonus given if you get a nurse to work for the company for the first time. TV in the large breakroom.

This hospital practices an unhealthy habit of having 1 charge nurse for 4 DIFFERENT MEDICAL-SURGICAL (MS) UNITS this has become \"normal\" and happens often. They utilize predatory employment contracts to dupe new grad nurses and new to critical care nurses into 2-year obligation contracts with NO SIGN ON BONUS! For a facility that is only 15 years old equipment is often broken such as monitors, mouses, keyboards, WOWs, MRI machine, CT machine. The employee parking lot is horrendous too small for how large the hospital has grown. Nursing management rounds purely to check off that it has been done which can come off insincere, management micro manages the staff. Very big on lunch breaks being taken but not on your state required 15 min breaks that should also be taken. LOTS of RULES AND PROTOCOLS to the point that it's not even to the benefit of the patient but the hospital."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great coworkers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This was my first hospital CNA job, and everyone has been so helpful and amazing to work with.", "cons": "I am a part-time employee, so I work twice a week.
