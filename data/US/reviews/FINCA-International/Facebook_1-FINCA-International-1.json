At FINCA you get to work with a truly diverse, global team where, despite such different backgrounds, everyone shares the same goals and mission. That may seem like a platitude, but at FINCA you will hear several languages spoken in every office (including D.C.) and will work with people from a couple dozen or more countries, but the mission is very clear and everyone is unified towards it. FINCA is also at the leading edge of the microfinance sector, as well as in new, related areas, so it is an exciting place to work, especially now.\r\n\r\nKinda kumbaya, in a good way. Precisely because FINCA is such a tight-knit group with a unified mission to improve lives, FINCA is one of those rare \u201cfeel-good\u201d places to work. There is very definitely a strong family feel here. Not in an overwhelming or cloying way, but in a supportive, warm, trusting and friendly environment where you could very likely develop some life-long friendships. (I felt like I was leaving home when I departed.) At the same time, everyone works very, very hard. But hard work well done is definitely rewarded and acknowledged throughout the organization.\r\n\r\nContinually new perspectives. In most positions you will have the opportunity to interact with staff working all over the world, often in remote areas of developing countries. (Literally 99% of FINCA\u2019s staff are based \u201cin the field\u201d on four continents.) That global interaction is an irreplaceable, culturally enriching experience that will make you see the world in a new way. Talking with my comms and marketing colleagues in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America, and learning how each of them thought about or approached any given issue (work-related or otherwise) was fun, fascinating, eye-opening, and instructive . . . and almost a daily occurrence at FINCA. I deeply cherished that constant diversity of interaction and perspectives at FINCA, and in those interactions I made friends from around the world.\r\n\r\nProfessional development. FINCA goes beyond most orgs to provide unique professional development opportunities that are related to the job, such as temporarily assigning staff (should they desire) to other countries to gain local experience and bring new skills to the region. FINCA has also implemented an extensive women\u2019s initiative with very real deliverables to help women staff grow professionally. For example, they recently held an interactive webinar with about 100 FINCA staff from 20 countries exchanging ideas during an online presentation by a renowned women\u2019s empowerment coach (who donated her time to FINCA). \r\n\r\nThe Harvard of NGOs. FINCA hires only the very best. You will find some of the brightest minds in international development, microfinance, and the respective fields of each employee here. So while the hiring process may be extremely selective and require hard work to make the final cut (in some cases, if you are a finalist candidate you may be asked by the department manager to complete case studies or fairly extensive screening assignments), the result is one of the most high-performing teams of professionals you will ever work with or meet, in any field. This makes for an intellectually stimulating environment, but it is not for the faint-hearted.  (See \u201cCons\u201d #1 below)", "cons": "Steep curves. The learning curve can be steep (depending on your department), especially if you don\u2019t have a background in microfinance or at least in international development. This is more of a warning than a \u201ccon\u201d in that, if you can, study up in advance. There are many good courses, books and online resources on microfinance, and they will serve you well.\r\n\r\nLimited travel. Because FINCA is doing everything possible to keep rates low for its microfinance clients, it has cut back considerably on operational costs like international travel. Some people appreciate not having to spend 36 hours to get to the middle of nowhere and then get on a return flight 12 hours later, but if you are looking for opportunities to do a lot of travel to far-flung places (which is in fact where FINCA\u2019s field operations and clients are located), don\u2019t expect to travel there on a whim or without a very good business case. \r\n\r\nOn your own. Again, this is a con or a pro depending on what you want and your style. FINCA is itself a dynamic, global entrepreneurial venture (its founder/CEO Rupert Scofield practically invented \u201csocial entrepreneurship\u201d; he literally wrote THE book on it, etc.), and a hyper-entrepreneurial culture is pervasive and evident at FINCA. I happen to love that kind of environment, and frankly, coming from much more conservative and bureaucratic employers it took me a while to adjust to FINCA\u2019s welcoming world of \u201cthink it and try it!\u201d (At first it seemed too good to be true, but it\u2019s real and is like a Silicon Valley/Google version of an NGO.) Because so many new ideas are constantly being developed at FINCA, and new roles are often created to work on those new developments, you will not find the typical entrenched and bloated infrastructure that you may have come to rely on.  So if you aren\u2019t the kind of person who is comfortable making things happen on your own steam \u2013 and without a playbook or an extensive internal matrix to fall back on \u2013 this may not be the right place for you. But it\u2019s a great place for the right people (and at the right time)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Noble mission, challenging execution, interesting place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I would recommend FINCA for those seeking experience in microfinance and working in the international development field.
