This causes high turnover once people realize their is no real growth after the first year. Officers leave this department in droves resulting in the loss of some excellent experienced officers. This has been a stepping stone department and trains some great people that end up leaving for more financial opportunities. This university should allign pay across campuses and also pay in the same range as OKC and Norman Police Departments. The constant turnover and low morale is a result primarily of the lower salary.  OUHSC officers have been treated second class and hopefully the new president will bring this department up to speed with salary and technology.  Officers at OUHSC do not have the basic technology to do their jobs such as MDT's (in car computers).
