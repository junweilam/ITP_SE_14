Bottom line: this company is going downhill steadily since the founding CEO\u2019s retirement announcement, and retirement. Many of the quality leaders have already left, leaving a foundation of leadership that does not lead by example, that has ZERO desire for any feedback on their actions, and has many scrambling to make themselves relevant to maintain their grip on what power they have.\r\n\r\nThe multiple reviews mentioning the poor HR department are all spot on. The HR team is one of, if not the worst I have ever experienced. The turnover in that department over the last two years is a clear example of issues there. They are not advocates of the employees, and possess a company-first mentaity. \r\n\r\nMy manager was hands down the worst I have ever worked for in over 20 years in the workforce. She is stubborn, doesn\u2019t trust her team, created a culture of fear in the departemnt, and liked it. She is aggressive and abusive.  Many intricate details of the jobs in her department were not written down and carried around only in peoples heads, making that knowledge hard to transfer. She had multiple people on the team reporting to her anything said, resulting in an elementary school level, tattle-tale paranoia. People on the team actively sold out their colleagues to eliminate rising talent in multiple circumstances in the last 5 years, resulting in multiple people leaving the company.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this lack of quality leadership is not exclusive to one or two departments. \r\n\r\nOfficers trash talking Directors on the work floor in front of employees not only adds to the toxicity, but goes to show that the layoff of 22 employees didn\u2019t get the right people out of the organization. \r\n\r\nMany of the people doing the bulk of the work in the company are working in fear, and are burnt out. The culture I fell in love with years ago is almost completely gone, replaced by a micro-managed, corporate environment.

Contributed very little to the day-to-day tasks, as they were constantly on eBay. Frequently condescending in their remarks towards other peoples' ideas that don't perfectly align with theirs. Their ideologies and methodologies were 10-15 years out of date (forcing CCAH to utilize tools that are 10-15 years out of date) and a source of contention with the entire team. Senior team member had more impact on the team's overall goals and priorities than the department's actual manager. Attempting to discuss and resolve these issues with the senior team member were met with confusion and denial by the senior team member. ALL issues brought to the team's manager were excused and/or ignored due to the senior team member's longevity with CCAH. Multiple team members have left CCAH due to this senior team member.\r\n\r\n- LOTS of political drama within the company. Frequently saw other departments' managers completely ignore policy and procedure to get what they wanted; which frequently caused extra work for our team. Certain departments are completely siloed from scrutiny, while others are held under a magnifying glass. Several managers were cut-throat and back-stabbing in their grabs for influence/power. I know of one manager that outright lied to get another high-level employee fired and then gloated about it openly to another employee. Some (bad) managers have threatened to quit if reorganized under certain (higher-qualified) managers/directors, so these managers have ended up staying around. This has lead to bad managers (and higher) having an easy time  in staying with CCAH and flourishing, as they've either pushed their \"foes\" out the door or their disillusioned/frustrated employees have left.\r\n\r\n- Our department was frequently swamped with work, severely impacting our department's ability to actually complete additional projects in a timely manner. Most departments appeared to have similar problems, with staffing always a problem. Entire company seems to have a high turn-over rate, with most staff lasting less than 3-5 years. Quality temp (i.e. non-benefit) employees have to endure years (literally) before being hired on as Full Time.\r\n\r\n- Raises have been changed to Merit-based rather than Cost-of-Living. Meaning you could receive a sub-COL raise due to factors outside of your control (i.e. project timeline missed due to other department, etc).\r\n\r\n- Several employees in other departments are the \"Eyes-&-Ears\" of their managers.

My director was stunned that I said good morning to her a week after submitting my resignation, she could barely mouth the words back while avoiding eye contact and walking past me. Another HR manager literally said nothing to me my whole two week period. I even asked for an exit interview and wasn\u2019t given one because they \u201cforgot.\u201d That\u2019s my number one reason for leaving a review here. \r\n\r\nWorking in HR, this was especially difficult to understand. I had to ask who was going to take over my projects many times, and was never actually able to hand those over because my management couldn\u2019t give me the time of day. I now know that they were busy planning layoffs so maybe that\u2019s why. Still, it\u2019s no excuse to mistreat an employee, or ignore a request for an exit interview. I was blindsided and let go one day early (seriously, what was the point). When my manager told me I was being let go one day early (told, not offered the chance), I felt seriously betrayed. I asked if I was going to still get an exit interview (no). I asked who was going to take over projects ab&c (uhhh let\u2019s schedule a meeting for 3pm). But hey, at least I was reassured I wasn\u2019t being fired (I know, I resigned)! I tried to leave on good terms, but after that last meeting I asked if I could just leave right then instead of the end of the day. I grabbed my things, tears streaming down my face and tried to leave without causing a scene. My manager chased after me even though I asked her to not to follow me, she kept asking what she did wrong. She quickly walked after me all the way to my car. It made me sad that she turned into such a cold person that she couldn\u2019t even see what was wrong with the way my departure was handled, but that\u2019s what being in HR leadership is all about at the Alliance. The saddest part is that if you don\u2019t conform then you\u2019re shut out. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is rude for the CAO to bring my personal life into this matter, which he did in a response to my previous submission. I don\u2019t bring my personal life into work with me, I don\u2019t share inappropriate photos from my vacations, and I don\u2019t interrupt meetings to watch my dog on my home camera. It\u2019s obvious that his HR team didn\u2019t want to be honest with him about what really happened that day, and the weeks prior. That truly speaks to the departments culture. I sincerely hope they can manage to change it. \r\n\r\nLeadership needs to understand that it takes more than saying you\u2019re a diverse and inclusive workforce to actually be one. A work environment where employees enjoy going to work, can connect with their colleagues and management, and feel safe to collaborate is not only going to attract talent, but keep it.

I once had a manager ask me, \"what were you doing for 15 minutes last Tuesday morning?\"  Apparently I had forgotten to log my time away from my desk and my manager who had too much time on her hands felt she needed to get to the bottom of it.
