If you are planning on working for a clinical area within the system, Scripps is amazing. If you are looking to work for IS, RUN!\r\n\u2028The IS department is run on nepotism. I have never worked in such a toxic work environment. The toxicity stems from the people in the top of IS. Any solution you submit for process improvement are usually seen as a threat to leadership and you will be castigated. \r\n\r\nI brought up the fact a colleague was doing something wrong that would put people in danger, this person came back and told leadership that I had farted purposely (not sure how one does that) in the middle of a conversation. Leadership was more concerned about my alleged flatulence than this persons actions that put people in danger. \r\n\r\nAlthough I had stellar reviews from students and my yearly evaluations my supervisors noted I was proactive, contributed positively, and was overall a \u201cjoy\u201d to get along with, I was held up to move back into a similar job I held pervious role within the clinical areas. Yet people with less skill and experience passed me by because they knew they needed to kiss the right butts. \r\n\r\nWhen I asked how I could improve, I was told I needed to be like able. Noting my evaluations spoke well of my like-ability, I was told, \u201cthis is exactly what I am talking about, the right people don\u2019t like you\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe culture of nepotism and like-ability being more important than job ability (yes that was actually said at an employee meeting), is exactly why this organization was recently prey to a malware attack. It\u2019s mostly full of incompetence. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when I started with the hospital, the orientation was about Ellen Browning Scripps and the Sisters of Mercy and how Scripps Mercy came to be. Meetings were always about the mission statement. In the two years I worked for IS, the only thing ever mentioned at large meetings was EBITDA, I never heard the mission statement from leadership at any single meeting. \r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t have experience this is a good place to get it, but get out once you have attained what you need. Most people do this and as a result, this organization has paid for a lot of certifications people take elsewhere because the working environment is so unbelievably toxic.

I worked in the ICU at 2 of the Scripps hospitals (occasional shifts at the others) for 8 years, the ICU has gotten progressively more stressful.  So stressful that probably 75% of the nurses that I've worked with in the ICU have left within the last 2 years for either other departments at Scripps or to other hospital ICUs.  All of us who left wonder why we didn't do so earlier."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "6 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management is accommodating to per diem schedule.", "cons": "Other hospitals pay a per diem wage"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Dietary Aide in La Jolla, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits for a part time worker", "cons": "Large company so this can cause red tape for making changes"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "It's not bad.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Auditor in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not bad at all.

In fact even though I have left the organization I continue to receive my care from Scripps Health because the care is top notch.  This is not because they are necessarily the most state of the art or most cutting edge, there just seems to be a genuine culture of caring imbued in the clinical staff.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the many locations spread through San Diego County are enviable.  The weather is nearly always pleasant.\r\n\r\nScripps has also invest heavily in physical infrastructure, especially in La Jolla and to the north.  As a result their workplace facilities are often incredibly new, well-designed, and state-of-the-art.", "cons": "I will bring up several themes that other previous reviewers have mentioned.  In many ways I deeply appreciate the visibility that GlassDoor offers, because in hindsight, I can honestly say I was not alone in my feelings, although I was led to believe so.\r\n\r\nI read in a previous review that Scripps is very much promotes people \"in the same mold\" or \"do not rock the boat\".   Based on my personal experience, I must concur with that assessment.  Although I was hired into a leadership position in SHAS (Scripps Health Administrative Services) from the outside, and told during the interview process my wealth of outside experience would be a great asset to Scripps, I was more often than not told formally and informally by my peers and other leaders that I needed to do more to fit in.  A trusted outside mentor of mine described it best to me when I recounted my predicament to her:  Scripps is a \"go along to get along\" organization.  Loyalty is valued much more valued as an asset than experience or innovation.   This was antithetical to the very \"speak truth to power\" leadership culture which had been instilled in me, so at the end of the day, it was a terrible fit. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is this \"go along to get along\" culture that drives opportunities for growth and promotion within the organization.   I can recount numerous times when individuals who were neither the most qualified, most senior, nor most capable were offered promotion time and time again simply because they fit the mold of a Scripps leader.  This is often the worst kept secret in the organization - certain individuals will get promoted because they are well connected while both looking and acting the part of a Scripps Leader, not because their talents or efforts really made them stand apart.    Again, this is probably the worst kept secret in all of Scripps and is often discussed behind the scenes, but is never addressed for fear of professional reprisal.\r\n\r\nLastly, probably the most challenging aspect of working at Scripps was working with my peers.  There is almost a \"Survivor\" like mentality among the director-level leaders and above at Scripps.  The very low turnover rates among the executive ranks, combined with the vast title inflation in the middle management, creates this Darwinian competition to get any advantage for promotional opportunities.  I personally experienced this behavior, and I saw it time and again happen to others.  Directors see each other not as colleagues, but as competitors, doing all they can to make themselves stand out, usually at the expense of one another.  This created an atmosphere of intrigue and maliciousness I haven't witnessed even in my years in the cutthroat world of publicly-traded companies.  Even for the best intentions, I was routinely thrown under the bus by peers.  Trust is minimal within peer groups, although at leadership gatherings everyone acts like it is all one big happy family."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Benefits and support worth it all", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Staff RN in Chula Vista, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Although my intentions were never to be a floor nurse (the goal has always been ED), Scripps Chula Vista made working feel like going to spend time with my second family.
