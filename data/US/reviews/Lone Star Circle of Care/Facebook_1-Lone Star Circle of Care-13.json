Helping vulnerable populations. And nothing else", "cons": "This is absolutely the worst workplace I've ever had the misfortune of being part of. There is extremely poor/non-existent communication both within and between departments. Example: me and my coworkers were notified that an orientation checklist was due to HR before we even started at our clinic, and yet we never received any actual orientation to our site even after months. Training/orientation is an absolute joke, a waste of time, and not clinically relevant at all. The culture really reminded me of a cult. You have no control or any notification about your schedule as a provider. The EMR used is the worst one I've ever used, and it was a common occurrence for documentation to be deleted/disappear from the system after charting, as well as for providers to ask for other members of the organization to terminate their EMR session multiple times a day as it constantly freezes i.e. a huge waste of resources and time. The EMR is not intuitive at all and features many redundant and time-wasting processes. Providers are harshly judged by metrics that you are not informed about, no matter if the metrics are relevant at all to what the patient is actually coming in for. They do not care at all about the patient care you provide, only if your numbers look good. The patient population's needs get very complex, yet there is absolutely no flexibility in the amount of time you have with each patient. This is absolutely the type of practice where underserved patients deserve more time for all the medical issues they have, yet you are incentivized to get them in and out like a cog in a machine. You do not have any admin time, despite the reality that healthcare providers need and deserve set time to deal with all the administrative tasks that pile up as well as complete charts. This results in you inevitably always working more hours than the standard work week, and of course the company is happy to have you work extra hours for no additional compensation. There is absolutely no wonder why most providers I saw here were drained and burnt out. If there were no federal loan forgiveness, I have no doubt that the number of providers working here would drop precipitously because of the horrible working conditions. I have never been in a darker mental space from a workplace. Providers must sign an employment contract and you are told there is no room for negotiation. This contract includes a non-compete clause, a provision that has been ruled by the Federal Trade Commission as anti-competitive and is set to be banned later this year. These clauses have been shown in studies to significantly suppress pay for workers as well as productivity. I would advise any potential employee to think long and hard about if they want to work for a company that explicitly participates and enforces in a predatory clause that restricts your future and options, and that is soon to be illegal. A prior review also mentions that some of the realities of Lone Star are 'par for the course'. I have worked in several different medical practices, and none of them even came close to how horrible this place is to work at. I wouldn't wish even my worst enemy to work here."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Seniot Software Engineer in Ireland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work culture and environment", "cons": "No cons as such now"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Loved it here", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Physician in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management very receptive to feedback.
