RN's getting hurt and basically safety measures are being removed. The company removed mechanical restraints stating that it was the \"new code\" which was an utter lie to staff. Their ratios of patients to staff is dangerous. \r\nThey expect you to physically hold a person for 2 hours, yet refuse to have staff around to do so. When a patient gets angry hope to god you get a hold of a doctor because when you call the code, no one shows up.  Avoid working residential. A patient could be harming themselves and you will have to do a physical hold on someone that probably has hep c while bleeding. Supervisors have little to no knowledge of state laws and shrug their shoulders and say \"oh well\".\r\nNo...you won't get a rasie, but you'll get a bonus which is questionable every time.
