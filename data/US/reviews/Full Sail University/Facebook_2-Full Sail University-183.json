Greedy stakeholders (Owners, CEO and his CIO wife, and upper managers) all want big bonuses, instead of fair pay for the other 90% of the staff (shareholders) that do the actual hard work for the students from Admissions to Education at this \u201cFor-Profit\u201d business. Instructors are forced to find a way to pass every student. Everyone's job is to keep the FA and VA cash cow flowing for all the stakeholders\u2019 profits and bonuses at all costs. The stakeholders run the school like a factory where you are a line worker with no power. Nor motivation to do anything extra. Promotions are almost non-existent in their factory system. If they do want you to move up, don\u2019t expect a big pay raise. Just more work for a few more pennies on the dollar. Stakeholders don\u2019t mind raising student tuition costs every year. It now is 70k-100k+ for a degree. But not the pay of the instructors similarly. Students have a general disrespect for their instructors these days because they know they can't be failed. And they know you don't get paid well. When they are paying more in tuition than you make in a year, they feel they can tell you what to do. Like they own you. Currently, there is no long-term reward for working at FS. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. Turnover is great for keeping wages low! Right! Go, stakeholders. But hey, what do I know, I\u2019m just a little ol' factory worker who knows nothin' bout how to run a successful business long term. I've only worked here 10 years to help the stakeholders build a product that makes huge profits for them. I shouldn't share in that success.

Not because the company doesn't have the money, but because the money is diverted to investors and executives.  If you drive past the campus, you will see vehicles that cost in excess of $200,000.  But look to the left and right of those cars and you will see old and rusted out vehicles, because most employees aren\u2019t paid enough money to be able to afford medical insurance, let alone a newer car.  \r\n\r\nExcluding investors and executives, if you work at Full Sail University (instructors and admin alike) you will be paid wages around $15.48 and top out at $21.  You may reach $25 if you've worked here in excess of 10 years.  The median income required to live on your own (in a studio rental) in Orange County, which includes you using the snap food program, is $25/hour (NOTE:  This Orange County estimate was put out before the 53%  inflation increase in 2022).  The enormous number of open positions at this school speaks for itself.  \r\n\r\nIf you plan to move forward in applying for a position here, BE AWARE:\r\n\r\n1.\tIt will take you multiple job applications attempts  before HR will see your resume, let alone read it, process it or contact you.  From the time they first reach out, the hiring process takes between 4 and 6 MONTHS for you to be interviewed, hired, receive paperwork, process paperwork, schedule NEO (new employee orientation) and start working.  And likely you will apply for 20+ jobs before you will be contacted by HR.\r\n\r\n2.\tBecause they cannot keep staff, due to wages so low people literally cannot afford to work there, your job will be to do the work of 2+ people in order to keep hitting the required metrics of your department.  \r\n\r\n3.\tYou will be thoroughly burned out and nobody will feel badly for you or help you.   Not because they don't care, but because if you work at this company, you are constantly under pressure to meet the same goals as when you are fully staffed.  Leads and Managers are under that same relentless pressure to perform.\r\n\r\n4.\tUnless you have someone else who can equally share the burden of finances (spouse, roommate, etc.), you will HAVE to have a second FULL TIME job in order to afford your average life.  at Full Sail they will tell  you, \"Everybody's got a side hustle.\"  That means that most everyone, executives and investors excluded, has to work a second job in order to afford to work for this company/university.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe pay listed for Full Sail University positions on GlassDoor is wrong.  The university pays 15-35% LESS than GlassDoor says.  Human Resources acknowledges that the GD pay ranges are incorrect.  Also, know that no matter who interviews you for any position, it is company policy to NOT TELL YOU THE SALARY OR HOURLY PAY until the final interview.  Why they hold back such crucial information is unknown.  It seems to be because the pay structure has more to do with seniority, rather than what the position or your necessary skills/experience should be paid.  Someone with a less involved job could be making noticeably more than you due to seniority.   Their pay structure is ineffective.  Even on the internal company career site, wages for positions are kept from current employees as well. \r\n \r\nMy best advice would be to look to other companies or universities for gainful employment.    The hype and the awards received for work environment and 'best place to work' are not reflective of the experience.  If you like the job description and lack the skill or experience, this is a great place to receive mediocre training, then gain on-the-job 'emergency room' style experience to hone your craft.  Once you hit your 6-month anniversary, apply to other universities/companies for the same position.   The job history looks solid on your resume and you will immediately increase your pay by 30-50%. \r\n\r\nI came to Full Sail University passionate and committed. In the end,  I gave my 2 weeks and left without another word.  I'm sad to share with you that, unfortunately, this is the true culture at this university.  It doesn\u2019t need to be this way, and the people want it to be what we were told it would be, but the executives and investors designed it this way and have chosen to keep it this way."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Elders will stab ya", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Assistant Admission Coordinator in Winter Park, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great information to learn amd met some great people", "cons": "Cut throat, jealousy, just do your job stay out of their gossip"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Learn and Grow Always", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Lab Specialist in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "voice is taken seriously autonomy lots of opportunities for self-development growing career opportunities and increasing upward mobility", "cons": "pay is low given the cost of living doesnt offer pet insurance limited opportunities for extended vacations due to revolving year long schedule limited celebrations or awards at the lower levels limited morale boosting events for staff"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great and flexible", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Course Director in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work environment and great benefits.", "cons": "Fast paced, feels like teaching on a conveyor belt, low pay compared to industry."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Needs improvement", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Sales Representative in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent auditorium and great audio and video equipment", "cons": "not very mentally stimulating work"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Low Pay Compared to other Universities", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "File Administrator in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people.

There are some cool programs, parts of the campus are nice (though most of it is former strip mall businesses), and there are many wonderful, creative folks.", "cons": "There is a combination of low pay, lack of real vacation, and watered down curriculum in the accelerated program. At a regular university, a professor might have 5 classes with 25 students each (probably less than that), which is 125 students max x 2 semesters = 250 student per year with the summers off. If they choose to teach a full load of 2 classes in a summer session, that's another 50 students (plus at least $2000 per class). So let's use 300 students as a comparison. Instructors are required to teach up to 54 students PER MONTH here. In 12 months, that's up to 624 students (not counting adjunct). That's about 2.5 times what a traditional school professor teaches and well over 2 times what that same professor is expected to teach if they also teach a summer session. \r\n\r\nSo let's say that college professor makes $50k. On a per student basis, an instructor at Full Sail should make $100-125k. But many make less than $50k and NEVER get a real vacation. The other issue is that most months, many instructors have adjunct sections, which they likely get about $400 after taxes for the month but which represents a 50% increase in workload. For many, this is mandatory. Many colleges also offer exceptional perks, like boosting 401ks and offering free tuition to family and children of full-time employees. Not Full Sail. They give 1% if you take out 5%. That's about as bad as it gets. You also cannot teach elsewhere or risk termination. \r\n\r\nObviously, if you have to teach more than double the students of professors from elsewhere... something has to give. It's not possible to give high-quality feedback, offer students the amount of learning that compares to a traditional school, and there's a certain amount of \"Full Sail doesn't care about me\" infecting teachers. Some just try to do really well and inspire, and some, too many, give all students As and copy and paste feedback, like \"You think you're using me, but I'm using you, Full Sail.\" Some instructors even have pride at streamlining their courses online so they don't have to do much. The students lose out. Many programs don't even have any books because FS won't pay for them. \r\n\r\nManagement is a nightmare. Most are overpaid, untrained, have never been in charge of people outside of FS, have never taught elsewhere, and worst of all, most have Full Sail degrees or cheap online PhDs. Yet some get paid well over $100k. Someone else mentioned a \"toxic positivity.\" That's very true. There's a lot of patting each other on the back, giving invented awards, marketing changes and decisions to employees, but management lacks the ability to listen, to change, to be fair. They value the superficial over what matters. I once ran into someone who worked at an accounting firm in Winter Park and said, \"I can't tell you what the executives make at Full Sail, but let's just say they are easily some of the wealthiest people we do taxes for--in the millions.\" You can see some of the cars that some of them drive--Porsches, Teslas, Mercedes, Audis, Aston Martins. It's obscene. That transfers to the \"marketing\" we do: behind the scenes tours, Hall of Fame week, celebrating the no-name HOFers every year, misleading billboards, online ads, etc. There is SO, SO much money from this little school charging the most they possibly can to students, many of whom shouldn't be in college, and the teachers see very little of it. There's a lot of pressure to pass all students. Since COVID, they don't even have to come to class. The CEO is all marketing like a Righteous Gemstones cousin. I heard he even got his pastor a 6 figure job. It's worse than nepotism.\r\n\r\nOutsiders that have come in from other institutions haven't lasted long. The way to get ahead is to be social and sing your own praises. No one cares about the core responsibilities of your teaching. In fact, there's a reason why there are no requirements to get into any program as a student. If you can pay, you can do any program. If it's not right for you, you can move to another. And so on. Admissions and advisers push students into graduate programs by telling students whatever they want to hear.\r\n\r\nIf you want to consider working at FS, you will have to do things the FS way. For many, that means being constantly overworked, underappreciated, and going through management hoops. The reason I think there are so many good reviews here is because people that have never taught anywhere else (or ever even gone to a different college as a student even) have been indoctrinated into the FS way and like the people they work with. Many probably feel lucky to be teaching at this level because they couldn't teach anywhere else above adjunct. Burnout is HIGH. YMMV based on who your management team is. Some are laid back and supportive. Others, like ones I've had, value the superficial and micromanage. This is much more like a corporation than a learning institution. When most of your teachers were taught at FS, and most of those teachers don't have any real teaching experience, it's hard to have a frame of reference for how things should be."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It's great till it's not", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Course Director in Winter Park, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule, no pressure to publish", "cons": "Toxic work environment, harrassment and bullying from supervisors if you try to make your classes rigorous.

Narcissism, nepotism, shady business practices, questionable education techniques, low morale and a creepy, cult-like devotion to senior managers define the corporate culture here.  If you come here thinking you are actually going to be a teacher you will soon find yourself frustrated.  The fact that admissions counselors make 3 times as much money as instructors should be an immediate red flag.  Many instructors don't make it past the first few months.  Most of the people at the top of this company graduated from the school and immediately went to work there without any real experience in the real world.  Almost all of the staff are under-qualified and it shows in the quality of their classes.  The company literature touts the staff as \"industry professionals\" but most have little practical experience in their industry.  12 hour days and overnight shifts are common.  The hours leave little time for any outside social activities and internal social activities are required with attendance being taken.  Seriously, what kind of company actually does that?  The senior management only speaks to underlings condescendingly if at all.  Communication is one way.  Management does not respond to e-mails or phone calls but if you don't respond to their requests immediately....even if you are in the middle of a class...you will be in big trouble.  The senor management doesn't seem to socialize with anyone outside the company and a large number of them are married to other senior managers which makes the atmosphere very strange.  Morale is low and you always feel like someone is watching you ready to pounce at the first mistake.  Student numbers are down and management's solution was to freeze pay raises, cut off bonuses and reduce hours.  They will still spend millions of dollars on parties and celebrations...events that requires staff to do all of the manual labor but they claim they are unable to pay a living wage.  Lower level management is abusive and petty and the entire atmosphere seems like an out-of-control grade school playground with the bullies at the top of the food chain.  Much of the instruction that students pay in excess of $80,000 consists of being being told to watch YouTube and Lynda videos.  For the last four years several of my classes were taught using broken and out-of-date gear.  If you are an educator or an industry professional older than 25 years old you will not last here.  If you see your job as running faceless dollar signs through the program to make room for more faceless dollar signs you might actually survive.  Never forget that this is a business first and a school last.  You are there to serve the owners and not the students. If you really care about education do yourself a favor run away from this place.

If the school advertises that students are taught by industry professionals, then give them industry pros in the classroom. The 'trainings' for educators (called CEs for short) are ridiculous and a waste of time. Very little valuable information is dispensed. Also, there are a lot of 'educators' that do not have the proper academic credentials; they would not be able to hold jobs in traditional education (for example: people with Bachelors, people with high school degrees, people with no degrees). Makes you wonder how they managed to qualify for national accreditation; FS would never qualify for regional because they are too loose in their standards.

Vacation allotment is typical of businesses (this is a business, not a school - don't kid yourself.

Your concerns are not a priority unless it is something that exposes them to legal liability, then they'll move quick. For a long time, to move up in this organization you needed to hang out and drink with some of the managers. If it's still that way, your competence has nothing to do with your value to this organization, but if you kiss enough butt, certainly you'll move up at some point if they like you as a drinking buddy. Some management is passive-aggressive, and sometimes they blanket rules on everyone rather than address a couple of individuals they have the problem with. \r\n\r\nAnother poster mentioned the \"if they don't like it, they can quit\" attitude. I can attest that attitude was witnessed by me several times from different managers. It's demotivating to hear managers say that about their workers, and I can only assume that is the attitude up the ladder. \r\n\r\nThey receive tax money in the form of student loans that were meant for educational services for serious students, yet there's no aptitude testing or real assessment of any kind for enrollment. It really is about maximizing money. If you can stomach being a cog in a \"school\" like this, go for it.
