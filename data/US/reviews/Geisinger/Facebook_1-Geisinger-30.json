The day to day is not to fix technical issues, but more to fix issues of other departments mistakes/being an emotional punching bag. For example, the organization had one of the worst transitions from working in office to at home. As a result, the load of unpreparedness was met with the IT Service Desk and we were only given a simple thank you and \"limp hand shake\" for the grueling hours it took to transition 30,000 employees to work from home. In addition, there was an influx of calls, for patient services, and their need to access their MyGeisinger(MyChart). The organization was once again unprepared for another drastic situation and patient care was hugely affected for days/weeks, but it was another task for the IT Service Desk to face as usual. Lastly, I would like to state that the incompetency's of the medical/office staff and their inability/lack of wanting to educate themselves on IT equipment/programs. It is mind boggling the amount of ignorance that these employees spew out of their mouths and how much they will refrain from trying to resolve their simple issues. For example, it is known task to have to reset passwords every Monday, because the staff will forget them over a simple 2 - 3 day weekend. It is also the most difficult to retrieve a tag numbers for a computer, because that task is \"not their job..\". Overall, there are many more examples that can be provided to shine light on this poorly created hospital, but I for one do not want to be a part of its mistakes any longer. I encourage you to look else where for IT employment and to refrain from assisting such a poorly managed company."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "EP", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Electro Physiology Technologist in Wilkes-Barre, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small group of like minded people who get along well to run a well rounded lab amazing doctors weekends and holidays is ff", "cons": "Some late nights\r\nLow staff although great people make days off and vacations hard"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "WFH CM", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "27 Apr 2022", "job_title": "RN Case Manager in Danville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working from home helping patients", "cons": "Long hours sitting all day"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Healthcare System", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Staff Nurse (RN), Emergency Room in Wilkes-Barre, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pays well for new grads and experience", "cons": "Short staffing can be problematic, but has been getting better"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good and getting better", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Transfer Center Nurse in Danville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is on par with inpatient nursing without patient contact", "cons": "Lots of computer face time and busy work that probably should be automated.
