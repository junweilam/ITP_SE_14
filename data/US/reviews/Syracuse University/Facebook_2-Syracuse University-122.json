It is a difficult place to work.\r\n\r\n- Innovation and new ideas are discouraged by people who have been there forever.  Don't bother - save your gems for a place that will appreciate them - they are out there.\r\n- There are a lot of layoffs happening as I write this, most recently from the marketing department - something like 30 low and mid-level staff - the folks who actually do the work and who had been hoping for someone to come in and provide them with some direction and positive change. At least they got the \"change\" part.\r\n- As a rule HR sucks and at SU they seem to embrace that whole-heartedly. Nothing like getting different answers depending on who you speak to or what mood they happen to be in that day. Personally, I was impressed by their inability to answer some of the most basic questions regarding benefits, tuition costs for staff, etc. It can't be easy to be in a job like that and remain so ignorant. That takes effort.\r\n- If your boss doesn't like the performance review you are required to write about your hopes and dreams working there, they will re-write it for you and replace your truth with their lies.\r\n- Parking is atrocious and expensive and SU makes you pay for it. Wear walking shoes and carry an umbrella is my suggestion. Schedule any outside appointments (doctors, dentist, etc.) at the very start or very end of the day, unless you want to factor in a long trek to and from your car.\r\n- Management doesn't know who you are or what you do and they seem ok with that. No one really knows what it is that they do either.\r\n- The folks that have been there for a long time have been through so many changes in management, that they don't latch on to the latest directives. Once new leadership comes in things will change anyway.\r\n- Impressively ugly office working conditions. Near-constant construction ensures that your nostrils will be assaulted by solvent smells, your ears by drills, hammering, jackhammers, and your working space perpetually covered with dust.\r\n- Good, talented, capable, and ambitious people are there for only as long as it takes to realize how much it sucks + the time it takes to find another job.\r\n- There are no perks. I think they discount season tickets. But they don't let you use that pricey parking spot they make you pay for for events. You have to pay again for that privilege. \r\n- Syracuse as a city is in really bad shape.
