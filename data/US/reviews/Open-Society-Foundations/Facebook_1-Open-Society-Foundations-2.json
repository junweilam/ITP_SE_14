Promotions are only possible with extreme political maneuvering, but if you make it to leadership you find there is a hierarchy of former and future government officials with questionable credentials. OSF is an incredibly bureaucratic institution so every decision takes weeks until proactive employees burn out. Ethics policies are ignored, and grantmaking is almost 99% sole source (this is open knowledge so I'm not giving anything away here), so most program officers give funds directly into their personal networks which makes the organization fraught with corruption. This may not be an issue if leadership took notice and empowered investigations teams but findings of fraud or conflicts of interest are routinely ignored.

What power are they given, or are they also in support roles? \r\n\r\nWhere is the gender pay gap report? \r\n\r\nOutside the US, offices look eerily like Mad Men. \r\n\r\nAlso, when you hire coloured women, please try not to parade them around as diversity hires. It still happens. Proper diversity training should be mandatory. It's the 21st century. \r\n\r\nManager training was finally made mandatory 3 years ago. How many decades has OSF been operating without this?! \r\n\r\nWay too little and way too late.\r\n\r\nI would be very interested in information about how many times the same grantees are funded. \r\n\r\nVersus how many times the decision-makers are open-minded and inclusive enough to find new organisations, fund grassroots groups, movements, and others. \r\n\r\nThis would be easy enough to find out - how many new eligibility assessments are done by each portfolio? Rather than renewing ones that will soon expire? \r\n\r\nHow many grant-makers are making the effort to fund meaningful work, rather than being lazy and giving multiple-year grants to the same groups?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Mission-driven org", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Deputy Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Mission driven with great programs and focus areas\nProgram staff are excellent and qualified\nsalary and benefits excellent", "cons": "Has become admin heavy--  too many non-program staff telling program staff how to do their jobs \nIssues with constant massive change, unstable leadership,  senior leadership mostly white males"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Exceptional benefits, great colleagues, complicated leadership", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Senior Program Officer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "amazing benefits, access to transformative resources, working with phenomenal people", "cons": "high staff turnover, little opportunity to influence leadership,"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Do not expect to save the world", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Program Operations Associate", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and salary.

The work can be interesting and meaningful.", "cons": "Here's the thing you need to know about OSF: although it funds some of the most important progressive organizations in the world, OSF is not itself a progressive organization. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a glaring lack of staff diversity. Fair workplace practices are a low priority. It can be an especially difficult environment for women and others who value a flexible, family-friendly workplace. Technically you are allowed flextime and can work from home; however it's granted at the discretion of your boss, so if your boss doesn't \"believe\" in it, you are out of luck. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a family that you like to spend time with or a life outside work, this could be the place for you. Most individuals are given the workload of 2-3 people, with which you can sink or swim. Managers often seem more interested in finding fault and assigning blame than with doing the real managerial work of genuinely helping staff succeed. As one colleague put it, \"Never have I worked somewhere where the word 'team' was used with such frequency while having so little to do with the daily reality of the office environment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSenior staff are typically not promoted to management based on their ability to manage people, but rather because they for one reason or another happen to please their own higher-ups. There's no incentive for them to support or protect the people who report to them, and they receive little management training. Therefore  management quality is wildly inconsistent across the organization--you can end up with a boss who is a micro-manager, or indifferent, or incompetent, or if you are lucky you may get one of the few who are decent. The environment lends itself to favoritism and cronyism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's very little sense of shared mission. None of my bosses seemed to have any genuine convictions--outside of their own career advancement. If you have a conflict or grievance with your boss, there is no avenue of mediation or recourse save going to HR (who are useless) or getting a lawyer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHR policy decisions would not be out of place at a corporation that is downsizing. For example, employees' spouses were unceremoniously dumped off of the health insurance plan. Meaning, spouses are now forced to take the insurance of their own employer. This was a short-sighted decision, made with little evidence that it saves money (in fact it likely hurts the organization by making its benefits package less appealing to potential hires, and makes life just that much more difficult for employees). Merit raises were eliminated and replaced by cheap, erratically awarded year-end \"bonuses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBottom line: If you're considering working there, take a close look at who you'd be reporting to and whether the job expectations and benefits are realistic."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great mission, but", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Program Officer in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "OSF remains unique among foundations for its fearless approach in taking on highly controversial issues that other donors would shy away from.

From funding groups that Soros' friends run, or friends of management, to just plain laziness when it comes to grant-making in funding the same groups over and over and over again for decades. \r\n\r\n2. Hypocrisy at all levels. From claiming to be bastions of human rights defenders while not finding new, smaller, grassroots, activist groups instead because it's too much work to evaluate them - all the way to deep-rooted institutional sexual harassment, racism and sexism.  Everyone talks the talk but it's all hot air. \r\n\r\n3. No one cares about diversity. Be prepared to be paraded out as a token minority if you are one, as a token sexual minority, or a gender hire. Be prepared to be made to feel like the only reason you were hired was your biology. \r\n\r\n4. Management receives barely any training, and certainly not on an ongoing basis. Managers are promoted if they're friends with the right people or have enough years of experience - whether or not they're good managers. \r\n\r\n5. Despite funding whistleblowers, OSF has a toxic attitude towards its own transparency. You can't even see a list of organisations it funds. Any complaints about transparency issues, management, personnel abuse and harassment, gaslighting, manipulation or bullying are instantly dismissed in favour of management. \r\n\r\n6. It's a boy's club. Just ask how many men are at senior positions, and how many women in supporting roles. If you're not a manager, you are thought of and treated as a secretary. \r\n\r\n7. Depending on your location, your salary will not match your experience and your value. Prepare for that. The US offices get paid well, everyone else is paid peanuts. Benefits packages are only available in the US. Everywhere else, it ends at healthcare. \r\n\r\n8. Sexual harassment is rife. From managers drunkenly attacking junior staff at informal staff retreats to religious-based harassment on the grounds of sexuality, this is an appalling place to work if you are a woman with an ounce of self respect. I counted more than three dozen colleagues who were silenced with money or threats of dismissal when they dared speak up. This for a human rights organisation is unacceptable. \r\n\r\n9. Once management is installed at OSF, their only escape is death or retirement. The old dogs rule, and it's an old-fashioned, behemoth of an institution without any desire to innovate or modernise - and that's down to even the tech used by employees. \r\n\r\n10. Salaries are minimal, but lavish annual staff retreats are thrown which is basically a giant week-long party. If your program's manager is friends with the right people, you can hold this party in Bali several times a year, on the company's dime of course. If you know who to talk to, you can even get your entire team to travel for several weeks to Brazil to 'attend conferences' rather than connecting via videoconference and spending that money on the nonprofit work that matters. \r\n\r\n11. Embezzlement of funds for private use. This happens all the time when managers skim off the top of their travel budget to get a long weekend in their home countries, or to add on a personal trip to a work trip and have it paid for by OSF. Bringing this to HR's attention is met with a blind eye or a reprimand."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great learning environment, many learning and development opportunities but no room to grow", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Program Assistant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great learning environment, many learning and professional development opportunities.
