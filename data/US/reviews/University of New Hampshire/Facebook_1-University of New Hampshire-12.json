If you're in a role where you get to interact with students you'll really enjoy it. There are plenty of caring co-workers that are in mid-to-lower-level positions--they're awesome to work with.\r\n\r\nIf you're able to create something or build a strong curriculum for your class, it can be a wonderful experience. As I said, my students were really great to work with including possessing a lot of passion.\r\n\r\nSalary can be quite good, although that's relative to your experience. The benefits are really great though especially health insurance. The retirement options are reasonable and comparable to other higher education institutions. Free access to the rec center, computer software, and low-level dental benefits (not necessarily stellar but I wouldn't consider it a con).\r\n\r\nMany of my students spoke highly about their experience with the activities (clubs) and their leadership. Also, the Counseling Center (or PACS) and OMSA were spoken highly of by students that I sent that way.\r\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the dining hall when I would go for lunch. It's in-house and they take a lot of pride in their work.\r\n\r\nThe Rec Center is also great between the facilities and staff that run it. Anytime I went to work out there, it was a pleasant experience and my students would share the same experiences.\r\n\r\nLastly, it sounds odd but the UNH Police Chief and the entire staff are awesome! They are always willing to help you out and are a positive influence in our community given the difficulty of their role.", "cons": "Unfortunately, there are too many cons to make this a respectable university to work for due to poor leadership. This isn't a problem of \"blame the President\" or \"the Provost doesn't...\" which many people tend to do. President Dean has been a breath of fresh air from the tired act of the previous president along with Provost Jones. This really focuses on the leaders that have held positions for far too long and have alienated many individuals and departments across the institution. There are too many backdoor deals where it's clear \"favorites\" are provided additional resources rather than to pay faculty (some without a contract for over two years while continuing to teach), or to not create bloat within other offices across the institution.\r\n\r\nToo many individuals have been forced out of the institution because they would speak their minds and challenge leadership, which their egos did not appreciate. Look at the organizational destruction and dysfunction caused by the current Dean of Students in regards to turnover amongst campus leaders. OMSA has been without a director for 2+ years, which students of color felt discouraged by although the staff they have is great. The Counseling Center became a mess for a few years before the new director finally came (who is also awesome!).\r\n\r\nIt's obvious that some colleges are provided more support and encouragement from the institution (not just donors) than other colleges, which would bother those of us in those underfunded colleges. For some reason, anything we wanted to do with our students needed to have the approval of the Associate Deans (Ok, fine) and Dean of Students (WHAT?! WHY?!). However, Admissions has no problem asking us to attend extra events they are running outside of our responsibilities without additional compensation.\r\n\r\nWhile my students shared stories of positive interactions with some offices as I mentioned above, they also would stop by to share displeasure with departments like Residence Life and Parking Office. They claimed it wasn't so many issues in the dorms or their roommates but more disappointing interactions with some office staff particularly the director. Several students mentioned inappropriate and condescending comments from her. I shared that with the Dean but have no idea if it was resolved. I could relate to issues with the Parking Office that students mentioned as they handed out tickets constantly when they couldn't even provide enough parking spaces. Students also expressed similar frustrations and interactions with a man named Jeff. You also have to pay for parking as an employee ($75, but it's an open parking lot without additional benefits of security)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Depends on your Department", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "7 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Lecturer in Durham, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are very good.
