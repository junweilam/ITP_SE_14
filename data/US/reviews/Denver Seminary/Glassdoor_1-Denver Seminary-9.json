Benefits are just as bad. PTO is not competitive and the remote policy does not allow for flexibility. Additionally, there are never opportunities for salary increase. To increase salary, one must move into another role. Employee retention is low due to dissatisfaction with pay and culture. The Executive Leadership Committee is very disconnected from the actual problems facing employees, faculty, and students. The perception is that decisions are made based on gut and not actual data or research. This committee is also secretive and there is little trust for the processes they are responsible for. Employees are facing extreme burn out and this is not being addressed appropriately. Rather than dealing with the frustrations employees have expressed (change fatigue, low pay, poor benefits, lack of trust in high level leadership, confusion in role, etc) HR is giving seminars on emotional intelligence that suggests the burnout is our own fault."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Data Entry Specialist in Littleton, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great School to for and with.
