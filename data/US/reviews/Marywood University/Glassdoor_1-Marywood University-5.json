After dedicating one and a half years of my life to this institution, my position was abruptly eliminated. This decision left me baffled and deeply disappointed in the university's management. When I approached the dean to understand the reasoning behind the elimination of my position, I was met with a feeble explanation. Apparently, the university was facing financial difficulties, and as a result, they were reducing the number of full-time faculty members. However, instead of offering support or exploring alternatives, the dean proposed that I continue working as an adjunct professor. This response demonstrated a complete lack of understanding and regard for the value of a tenure-track position. It is disheartening to witness how the management of Marywood University is actively contributing to the deterioration of their own institution. The decision to downsize the number of professors is not only short-sighted but also detrimental to the quality of education offered. Professors and students form the backbone of any university, and by compromising the number of professors, the university is directly compromising the quality of education and potentially hindering student enrollment. Furthermore, the lack of coordination between different departments at Marywood University is alarming. There should be a cohesive and uniform system in place, especially in crucial areas such as HR and IT. The absence of such a system not only creates confusion and inefficiency but also hinders the overall functioning of the institution. In conclusion, my experience at Marywood University has been extremely disappointing. The decision to eliminate my tenure-track position without exploring alternatives, coupled with the lack of coordination between departments, reflects a mismanagement that is detrimental to the university's future. I sincerely hope that the management realizes the importance of professors and students as the lifeblood of any educational institution and takes necessary steps to rectify these shortcomings."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Financial Aid Counselor in Scranton, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Community atmosphere and very nice environment.", "cons": "I do not have any at this time"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Assistant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "6 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Scranton, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful coworkers and students in my department.
