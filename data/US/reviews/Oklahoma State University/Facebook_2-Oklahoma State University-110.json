This creates a hotbed of new and challenging projects that spawn off one another and regularly let a developer, architect, and team lead stretch their talents and skills.\r\n\r\nOther items of note:\r\n*There are an assortment of short and long terms projects. When one finishes, people often move to another project for either the same or a different client. Different projects use different technologies to match the clients' needs, so people do pick up new concepts and environments.\r\n\r\n*The ability to collaborate and communicate is a must. Team members - from leads, to architects, to backend/frontend developers, designers, so on and so forth - everybody works together in a fast paced manner to complete tasks, sprints, and projects.\r\n\r\n*Agile methodologies are used to provide rapid, iterative deployments for our clients to work with. No waterfall.\r\n\r\n*Career growth. In addition to having the opportunity to learn new technologies, the development manager works with each employee to discover what they want to do, career wise, and helps them move toward it.\r\n\r\n*While occasional long hours are necessary, most weeks see only 40-50 hour work weeks with a standard 8-4/9-5 work day.\r\n\r\n*People are encouraged to discuss their solutions to problems, and learn what they can from other team members.", "cons": "Many of my friends are in computing technology, medical, or other big business.
