Worse part is that health care techs sit and chat in a nook and only help those staff nurses they are friends with while neglecting their assignments. When confronted, they are passive aggressive.

great place to work; the pay is great for nursing staff and doctors/providers. \n-They are always hiring, and willing to hire new grads fresh off the graduation stage.\n-The company is working diligently towards DEI in the workplace.\n-Atrium offers tuition assistance, but unless you are working towards a nursing degree is it difficult to get. You can also use it for continuing education credits (seminars, webinars, etc.), which is easier to get.\n-The Recognition and Rewards platform is, or can be, a great way to show appreciation to employees. Every time I received a WOW card from family or eCard from my colleagues or manager, I realized my value.", "cons": "-Pay is horrendous for anyone outside nursing. \n-They pick and choose who will get compensation for commuting; I worked a re-deployment assignment alongside someone who lived closer than I did and that employee received mileage pay for their re-deployment assignments. \n-If you aren't from the immediate area you are working, you will never break the code to make work friends. It was the loneliest place to work ever. \n-Calling employees \"teammates\" (and having supervisors and managers who correct you when you don't use the terminology) is so demeaning and childish. \n-Nepotism is rampant. Management will hire immediate family into roles they are unqualified for, including roles that require certifications. \n-The VIA awards (which come with points that can be redeemed for gift cards or pretty decent gifts) went to the same favorited people in administration. VIA awards have to be approved, so if someone outside the favorite clique was nominated, they were generally declined. \n-Atrium's continuous moves towards overtaking other healthcare facilities is atrocious. They are turning into a healthcare \"not-for-profit\" conglomerate that had a revenue of $10.7 billion dollars in 2019; failed to provide crisis pay for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic; cut annual COL raises in 2021; and still gave the CEO a 9% increase in pay in Jan 2021 (he received a 20% increase in pay in Jan 2020).\n-Atrium partially owns the employees' insurance provider (MedCost) and yet it is barely affordable. For the 2 years I was working there, the prescription \"benefits\" constantly changed coverage, which happened to affect the medications I was taking every time. The LiveWELL incentives were impossible to obtain, and never posted to your spending account. \n-Insurance barely offers any mental health coverage, and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Atrium touted their Code Lavender \"mental health support\", which is just a phone number to call when you are stressed out. Frequently, someone would drop off a container of cotton balls soaked in lavender oil and a paper asking us to write our name down if we wanted someone to pray for us with the phone number at the bottom of the page."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Outpatient Nursing", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great managers, great teammates, decent compensation/benefits", "cons": "Large organization, sometimes feel lost in the crowd.

The benefits are also terrible.  They are horribly staffed because of this. Half the nurse manager jobs are vacant, and all the nursing units run with a 30%+ vacancy. Then nurses are begged and guilted into working excessive overtime to care for the patients. Bedside nurses don't receive any pay differentials for advanced education, certifications, specialty, skills, etc. They pay a diploma nurse working in a SNF the same as an ICU nurse with a master's degree, multiple specialty certifications, and other advanced training and credentials.\r\n\r\nCHS is a massive organization, however, I've seen far better benefits with far less employee cost in small private companies. CHS owns half of the insurance company (MedCost), and therefore has no incentive to negotiate lower rates for their employees. They were actually sued for this, but some small loophole saved them due to their death grip on their \"Hospital Authority\" tax status which was eliminated decades ago. \r\n\r\nNurses are treated like toddlers. I'm a college educated healthcare professional, Its insulting to be given fun sized candy bars as a display of management's appreciation. Other employers in the area are paying nurses TWICE as much, with superior benefits at a lower cost. Meanwhile, CHS pays their corporate leaders a ridiculous salary. I still don't know what they do.

Lots of turnover due to pay, low morale, lack of upward mobility and, at least in my opinion, lots of inexperienced managers who had simply snuggled up in one way or the other to the people that hired them. This is how it is at most corporate offices, granted, but it's reallllly bad at CHS. Plenty of tenured, 35-55 year old people who are put under the control of  much younger, inexperienced managers who upper management feels are less threatening. Tons of talent wastes away/walks out the door because many of the managers suppress ideas, use scare tactics and micromanage because they're terrified of being upstaged by their subordinates. That being said, if you want to be a manager or above here and you have \"impressive\" credentials from another industry, you probably have a pretty good shot.\r\n\r\nThere's also a bit of a \"grass-is-greener\" mindset where upper level management will automatically look outside of the organization for new leaders instead of promoting proven workers from within. The consequences are often new managers from other industries who are now supervising tenured employees that already know the healthcare industry inside-and-out. This inevitably leads to insecurity among management, which leads to micromanagement, unwarranted criticism and mistreatment of employees, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nThe SVP position tends to recycle frequently (every 2-3 years) due to high-stress, sub-average pay, which means every time a new SVP takes over, he or she will assuredly want to hire \"their people\" while intentionally marginalizing potential \"threat employees\" within the workplace and beginning the cycle again.
