A few programs and buildings are maintained - that's great. As they should be. Others are neglected. Enrollment is steadily declining. I don't suspect this institution to be here within the next 10-20 years. It's poorly managed, has bad work culture. The individual faculty and many workers are kind and thoughtful and brilliant. But taken as a whole, as a system, this place is a mess. I've never worked at an institution that seemed so desperate to attract students, to present itself as elite. Just about everyday, there are tours. Students and family members get funneled through buildings and given tours, but honestly, I feel like the university is misrepresenting itself and lowering its standards to accept more and more students who aren't prepared to go to college. Then, the institution doesn't support or invest in them properly.
