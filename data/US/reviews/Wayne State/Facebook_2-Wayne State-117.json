Networking Opportunities: You will have the chance to work closely with faculty members and other professionals in your field, which can help you build valuable connections and expand your professional network. Financial Benefits: In addition to gaining valuable experience, Graduate Teaching Assistants receive a stipend, which can help to offset the cost of tuition and other expenses. Flexibility: Many Graduate Teaching Assistant positions offer flexible schedules, allowing you to balance your work and academic responsibilities. Professional Development: Wayne State University offers a variety of professional development opportunities for Graduate Teaching Assistants, including workshops, seminars, and conferences, which can help you grow as a teacher and scholar.", "cons": "Heavy Workload: Graduate Teaching Assistants often have a heavy workload, which can include teaching multiple classes, grading papers, and holding office hours. This workload can be overwhelming, particularly when combined with your own academic responsibilities. Limited Control: As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, you may not have as much control over course content and teaching methods as you would if you were the primary instructor. This can be frustrating if you have a particular teaching style or approach you want to use. Limited Job Security: Graduate Teaching Assistant positions are often temporary, and you may need to reapply for the position each semester or academic year. This can create uncertainty about your job prospects and financial stability. Limited Benefits: Graduate Teaching Assistants may not receive the same benefits as full-time faculty members, such as health insurance or retirement benefits. Professional Pressure: As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, you may feel pressure to balance your responsibilities as a teacher and a student while also trying to establish yourself as a competent and capable professional in your field. This can be challenging and stressful at times."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "NA", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Supervisor in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "university environment, learning, professional development", "cons": "There is opportunity for growth"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to learn and grow within the research field!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They offer great benefit such a tuition reimbursement of 100% as well as great health benefits and retirement plans.", "cons": "The salary wages are low unless you have a masters degree and receive a higher role."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "The supervisors at Student center are very nice", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The supervisors at Student center are very nice and they really care for students", "cons": "Some staffs in some departments are impolite"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "DECENT", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Undergraduate Research Assistant in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexibility, growth opportunity, networking, education", "cons": "not good if you are not interested in joining academia"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Consider Alternatives", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Research Assistant Professor in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There aren't many pros compared to people who hold jobs in industry, e.g., benefits, remote work, etc. Autonomy being the pro.", "cons": "Writing and publishing expectations, grant writing and fund raising expectations, amount of hours of effort it actually takes to accomplish required goals; (without being on a tenure track) why should non-tenured individuals be required to achieve as much as those who have a life-long commitment from their University, what gives?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Activities", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The supervisors are very nice", "cons": "You will have a lot of work to do"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Place for Mobility", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "16 May 2023", "job_title": "Academic Staff in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Has tuition reimbursement.
