I was let down immensely. Turnover across the organization (PSRs, nurses, finance/billing staff, custodians, providers, administrators, etc.) is extremely high and it seems like management, for the most part, does not care. The CEO could not be bothered to interact with staff, not even with a simple email or a brief appearance on the orientation video in which other executive leadership members appear. Have a new, innovative idea on how something should be done? Unfortunately new ideas are not welcomed in this highly traditional organization with its antiquated way of doing things. Want to change your hours slightly to make your work/life balance more even? Likely not going to happen, even though they love to say that employees have a great work/life balance. I have never felt like more of a cog in a machine than I have at New Horizon. I hope I can help at least one person steer clear of this organization. No position is exempt from the low morale that plagues New Horizon, which I have found out through various conversations with employees. Unfortunately I cannot see this changing anytime soon unless they decide to hire a new executive staff and replace some of the other managerial positions. Until they decide to do that, you need to find an organization that actually values its employees."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Do your research", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Greenville, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "State benefits, flexibility for family, like most of coworkers and love the clients.

The organization looks great from the outside but has MAJOR issues within the inside and the issues start with leadership!!!\r\n\r\nTo whomever reads this post.......do not apply for work within this organization unless you\u2019re absolutely and I mean absolutely desperate for employment! Make New Horizon your last resort!!! This organization does not value their employees\u2019, there are too many conniving and two-faced individuals in leadership. They will try to discredit you as an employee/person and even lie on you so that they will have an excuse to get rid of you or force you to resign. There\u2019s a huge lack in leadership throughout the organization, lack of team-work, and communication is the worst that I have ever seen!!! The employees\u2019 are afraid to voice their opinions/speak up for what is right due to the fear of losing their jobs because of the dishonesty and distrust of those in administration/leadership. Everyone is so busy working against each other instead of working together-and it\u2019s very sad because the patients should be the top priority. \r\n\r\nMy director was very disorganized, constantly procrastinated important work , and was very forgetful or just acted like she was dumb most of the time but the first impression of her-well let\u2019s just say it will leave you thinking??? When you can come to work looking as if you just rolled out of bed (the walking dead)........you have some serious issues. The worst thing about the situation is that her superior thinks she does just an outstanding job in her department and runs it well, but fails to realize how lazy she is and how her actual staff does all the work but gets no credit for it! But, it must be nice to sit at a desk all day sending emails and putting your work off on your staff instead of working as a team. She should be working for a company of 20-50 employees because New Horizon left her behind years ago!\r\n\r\nFinally my advice to anyone is to always always do your research before applying to a particular organization, because when an organization is constantly hiring and has a very high turnover rate especially when it comes to medical providers........\u201cTrust Me\u201d there are some major issues they don\u2019t want you to know about and will do or say anything to paint a pretty picture (Be Very Cautious!)."}]]
