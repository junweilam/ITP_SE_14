You are expected to have paperwork done in a timely manner, and this typically means working through lunch if you are able to take a break at all, working after close, or on your free time in which you will not be compensated for/paid overtime. Management is clearly overloaded. They are there when you need to make a call and express concerns, however they are not there to ever do a check in and see how things are going, give helpful feedback, etc. As an employee at Daymark, you are left in the dark about much of the changes and what is happening until the very last second. I was unable to ever get a straight answer on anything, especially from the HR Department. There is limited training here upon hire, which means you feel stagnant in your skills, which is a problem as majority of the clinicians are provisionally licensed and wanting to learn to be better mental health providers.
