When I brought this data (my paystubs compared to the rate of pay I was promised when hired) to management, they denied any error, claimed I had been overpaid, and was lucky they weren't asking me to reimburse them. I filed a grievance with the union, which was useless. Don't think you will get any advocacy from them -- my pay decreased AGAIN when I joined the union. After a year debating my case, they closed it, stating that because I was never given an offer letter, they had 'no paper trail' They noted SeaMar has a reputation for doing this.
