The Masons seem to have gotten away from their core beliefs and now only focus on money. We have actually been told they want out of the long term care business because there's no enough money in it anymore. They now want to cater to assisted living residents.  Nurses jobs are being cut or even used as aides, due to the inability to keep aides. I have seen some really good nurses lose their jobs due to new management. Most of the nurses left are older and have been there for decades and are afraid to leave.  They are all jealous of each other and at each others throats afraid they could lose their job while another would keep their job. In addition, employee benefits have been slashed. Ever heard of a $10,000 deductible for health care, that you pay for every week through your paycheck?  If I or a family member get sick, I essentially take a $10,000 pay cut. If they really need to save money, cut the fat from management, not the people providing care."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Loved my coworkers, executives a joke", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Home Care Billing in Springfield, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay if you work at the corporate level\nDecent benefits\nBeautiful facility\nWonderful staff\nMultiple opportunities within the company for growth", "cons": "Archaic management. \nConsistent executive level turnover means consistently stagnant company.
