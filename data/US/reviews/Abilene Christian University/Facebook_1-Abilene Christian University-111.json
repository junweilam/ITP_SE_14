This created a shake-up in the organizational structure, vision and strategic approach to success - in the best way possible. As an executive administrator (assuming you were viewed as a positive change-maker) you were given great latitude to think outside the box and develop teams with the strengths that matched the goals set forth. And over the next 5-6 years, those investments had a tremendous impact on the university's success. Although this mentality has lessoned some over the past few years, there are still strategic areas that are run more like a business profit center than an academic institution. As a non-academic administrator, this is what you should look for as you will find your compensation and operational budget comparable to a corporate position and more than many other like-sized universities are willing to invest. ACU also offers above average benefits to its employees and encourages a positive work/life balance.

ACU tends to promote from within, but not because of a strong employee growth plan. Instead it's due to cost cutting measures, poor needs assessment and inability to persuade talented professionals to move to Abilene. This pushes current employees in positions where they are likely to fail due to inexperience. There are a few areas on campus that bucks this trend, with the university investing appropriately in both personnel and operational budgets. Not surprisingly, these are areas where ACU finds success. If you are considering a position on the academic side of the institution you may find more tension with administration than those on the non-academic side. However, having worked with the current provost on several projects, he's an amazing academic leader and a trusted asset to the university. The City of Abilene is a detractor for many unless you are looking for a slow-paced, conservative community with little options for entertainment and family activities compared to larger cities.

In my experience, either you have a manager who micromanages you or you have a manager who doesn't manage at all. The company is not meeting their numbers or just barely scratches by but nothing seems to be done about it other than putting more pressure on the advisors. Instead, they use high-pressure sales tactics to try to convince students to enroll right now in order for advisors to meet the high goals. And they wonder why there's such high turnover. \r\n\r\nThere is little to no investment in technology, which is ironic from a company that refers to itself internally as a \"tech company\". Salaries are incredibly low, even for a non-profit and there is very little chance for raises once you have established your starting salary. And even if you're lucky enough to get one, it's not much. They tend to hire recent ACU graduates at low salaries in order to exploit them as cheaper labor. My advice to those looking to work at ACU is to base your salary off of their range of $40k-50k for a regular advisor (with tiers of $50-60k for senior and $60-70k for executive advisors) and try to end up in the upper part of that range, otherwise you'll get stuck with a low salary. \r\n\r\nThose looking to work at ACU for the Christian environment will be disappointed because it is only a pseudo-Christian environment for the most part.
