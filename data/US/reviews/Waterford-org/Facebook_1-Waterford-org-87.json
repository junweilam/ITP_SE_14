Then that position is often seen on the careers page with different wording, possibly a slightly changed title- but essentially the same position - with in a few weeks. Unfortunately in 2022 Waterford.org still operates as an \"old boys club\" (which has been a BIG problem for years) picking, choosing and protecting their favorites. A few years ago there was a big push for DEI but many minority employees (at least my friends that are minorities) feel that it is for \"show\" and to appease those organizations/foundations funding and giving grants to certain Waterford programs at a very high dollar amount or their funding will be lost. Waterford is an 85%+ Mormon (LDS) organization and if you are not LDS you are perceived as an outsider in my experience. This is not said but 'felt\" by many. Additionally, there has been high executive Directorship level staff turnover with in the last 3 years. The 2 top Marketing executives left for other opportunities, several Regional VPs of Sales left for other opportunities and VP/Director of Partnerships was just laid off along with other key Implementation/Success Managers/Directors who were laid off and or left for other opportunities. Its extremely stressful knowing that even if you do your job and do it well you may be let go at random no matter what department you are in. Many believe that layoffs are biased and those that are allowed to stay are based on favoritism, \"popularity\" and who you know in the organization - not based on performance. Additionally, they tend to lay off people that work remotely rather than those in the immediate area of the office. There are some wonderful people here but if you choose to come join the Waterford.org team, be certain to come with your eyes wide open and be aware that you could loose your job at any time on the whim of management, for no apparent reason and no matter what you brought to the table to make a bottom line difference in revenue or mission."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Entry level", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Jan 2023", "job_title": "User Support Specialist in Sandy, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great goals as a org.

The company recently made some management changes, and with those management changes came a shift in the company's idea of priorities.  The company has lost sight of their original mission- which was helping children- and now it is more about how many children they can get to participate in the program. They stopped caring about the people who work there and because of that, in July alone, they lost over 30 employees. The turnover rate has been escalating from there. With the lose of great people, they have been spiraling downward ever since. Part of the reason people have chosen to leave is because they didn't feel valued, they were being micromanaged, and even their break time (even slightly over the allotted 30 minutes) were being taken out of their pay. Employee's weren't being listened too, and with multiple surveys that were done on the floor, management still maintained that they were not doing anything wrong.  After a survey was completed the director took all of the voices of the employees personal, and tried to reprimand the person who reported the results. Management would offer promotions, and then when the position would finally open, they would give it to someone less qualified.  The overall environment at the Taylorsville office, for UPSTART, has been downsized to fit a model similar to any other call centers, and  what once was a very loving place to support families and children's learning has become practically a dictatorships.
