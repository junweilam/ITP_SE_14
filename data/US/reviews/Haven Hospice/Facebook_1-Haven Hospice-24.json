The work shift is standard M-F, 8-5 unless you're on call. The Gainesville location is on a beautiful campus with restaurants and stores nearby. This is convenient for those who don't want to stay in for lunch every day. Communication between staff is good for the most part. There are many different ways to communicate; phone, text, chat, email, etc. I enjoy the employee newsletter that is issued monthly.\r\n\r\nEmployees are provided with the equipment needed to do the job. There is good support from IT and the training department. Performance reviews are done on a regular basis so there are no surprises. Salary increases happen annually IF their census and money is available. Bonuses are offered if there is money left over (this is a non-profit organization). The company encourages manager/employee one-on-one meetings so you have a chance to meet with your manager regularly. There are also all-employee town hall meetings with executive presentations.\r\n\r\nHaven Attic stores are fantastic.
