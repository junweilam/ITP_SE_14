They have wonderful training and amazing minds working on client progress. The campus is beautiful and well done. The cafeteria food is great as well. I wish I had worked in the hospital since it seems so much more professional and put together. I have complete respect for The Menninger Clinic, however the program I worked at (Pathfinder) does not live up to the reputation I was drawn in with. \r\n\r\nYou get free food sometimes working at Pathfinder and do get to have some fun adventures when there's outings.  There's a lot of funds to do activities with clients and depending on the amount of clients, you can have a good amount of interaction with them and work on fostering good interpersonal skills with them. You also have the chance to explore your own hobbies and passions if there's a way you can use them to connect with a client. \r\nFor example, if you're really into comics and there's a client who really loves comics and you two click on it, management would be okay with you two going out to a comic convention on a weekend and would pay for your ticket as long as it's therapeutic in nature.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for easy money, a job that doesn't require a lot of thinking, where you spend most of your time driving and texting clients, and doesn't have a lot of paperwork to fill, then this would be good for you. I also enjoyed working with the team of RA's; i made some strong bonds with good employees after all those 14hr shifts. It always killed me to see them just as sad as I was working there and not being able to live up to their full potential. \r\n\r\nOverall the building is nice, the apartments are sometimes nice, depending on the clients living in their and how clean they are, and you don't have to drive your own vehicle. The supplied vehicles aren't too bad, except for a large white van. \r\n\r\nRA position only works 3 days a week, 14 hr shifts.", "cons": "I was lied to in my initial interview about the potential for job growth and my schedule and the actual nature of my job. I was promised many things and ultimately ended up being a driver and baby sitter for clients. And also ran errands, sometimes for clients and sometimes for my boss. \r\nEXTREMELY poor management.\r\nExtremely low morale amongst workers. Management doesn't seem to understand that they are the sole cause of the misery amongst their workers and instead blame the workers as opposed to trying to find the root of the problems (which is themselves). Managers micro-manage and don't seem to understand the nature of the very job role they created; they constantly change rules and procedures because they literally don't know what they actually are. Managers give unsolicited extremely negative career advice and make the workers feel horrible about themselves. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy having boundaries with clients, throw those out the window because boundaries barely exist here.\r\n\r\nManagers tell employees to not refer to factual instances of sexual harassment as sexual harassment, and then chastise employees for deciding to not engage with clients after said harassment. Management rather insists on employees getting closer to clients after sexual harassment (again, boundaries don't exist here)\r\n\r\nManagers take everything personally, and don't seem to notice when employees actually go above and beyond their job description.\r\n\r\nManagers hire people who are way over qualified for the position and expect them to perform job activities that are not in their job description and get mad at them for not doing the things not listed there. Job description is vague for that reason. \r\n\r\nI've heard clinicians literally refer to clients as dogs. \r\n\r\nThe secretary there is notorious for yelling, having temper tantrums, causing a scene in front of clients, picking fights with employees and being the very definition of passive aggressive. She also likes to make new employees do her job for her (without any previous training or notice) while she can escape the office for a few hours and usually has the support from management when doing this. \r\n\r\nThe ethicality of how expensive the program is for clients (about $20,000 a month)  (vs how little employees get paid) is also extremely questionable. Is it really ethical to recommend a client stay in a program for 6 months or longer when there's far better treatment options out there that are less expensive? \r\n\r\nThis place is a business primarily. There is no question about that. Employees, specifically RA's, are treated as less than humans who are expendable. It's such a shame they've let so much talent go. In the short span I was there, over 8 people from a variety of different positions quit. My boss didn't even look me in the eye for months after I was hired, much less check in with me and see how my new job was going. My other boss didn't even bother to really learn my name until maybe 4 months in. Mind you, it's a small building with about ~15 people there working on a business day. There's no excuse for treating employees as less than human. \r\n\r\nOverall the work place is extremely unprofessional. I think the only reason this program is still running is because it brings in a lot of money for the hospital. \r\n\r\nAlso, the privacy rules for this place are extremely questionable."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Dead-end job for Degreed employees unless you are a nurse.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Degreed Mental Health Associate in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small company.
