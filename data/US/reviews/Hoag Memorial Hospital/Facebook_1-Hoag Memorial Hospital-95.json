Yet, staff is threatened with disciplinary actions all the way to termination for any overtime accrued including 1 or 2 minutes and missed time keeping events. Leadership seems to believe that it is acceptable for the staff to work so hard to meet their expectations of service while not providing adequate staffing. The hospital also will not hire applicants who have worked at a union hospital to minimize any influence of unionizing nursing and keep tight control on the staff. The hospital declines to use travelers while remaining critically understaffed in specific areas of the hospital.

They will treat patients and enter the patient into the system later to make it appear as though that patient arrived later, why? Because the hospital could be audited and fined for placing patients at risk. Advice: Always document everything and note times, protect patients and your sanity and blow the whistle if you are asked to do this by your charge RN.\r\n\r\nClosed positions: Either due to death, quitting or termination positions are a struggle to fill or reopen leaving you with less help when either occurs.  \r\n\r\nSexual Harassment: Some transport staff and EVS can be inappropriate.

Hoag is by far the worst place I have EVER worked for.  Shortly after beginning employment with Hoag, I unfortunately got diagnosed with a rare nerve disease (CRPS).  I initially took an intermittent leave of absence because I wanted to work as much as I could still.  I began to be harassed and accused of \"faking\" my disease.  When I told my Lead about it, his reply was \"Well, what do you expect, for them (the subordinates) to be happy with you?\".  I was SO let down and shocked.  I told my manager about it, and nothing changed.  My picture got de-faced twice (which I will post on here) and when I reported it to Human Resources, their answer was to just put a glass enclosure over the picture so no one could get to it.  I asked \"But, are you going to actually take care of the root of the problem and not just cover my picture and sweep it under the rug?\".  Human Resources and managements answer was \"yes\".  Unbelievable.  So I replied by saying \"But that doesn't take care of the problem, I am being harassed\"  I explained that I felt the proper protocol should be for all laboratory personnel to have to review and sign the 'Code of Conduct' again.  They finally did, but Human Resources took credit for the idea later.  Eventually, I started looking for a different job because the harassment and stress became so bad, and stress plays a direct role with my disease and aggravates it.  So, I went to an interview and to my disbelief, the Manager I interviewed with had somehow spoke with someone at Hoag and that someone at Hoag had given all of my PRIVATE medical information to this manager at the nearby hospital I interviewed at!  I was mortified and in actual disbelief and found myself trying to explain my disease in this awkward interview.  This is a major HIPAA violation!  \r\nTo top this all off-  my mother & father-in-law are benefactors at Hoag, meaning they have donated enough money to have a donor's plaque on the wall at Hoag Hospital.
