Also the Soiree and Shindig events are a joke. RMHC of Arkoma \"features\" a family that stayed with us in those events (non shockingly a family with lots of followers and obviously have a \"heavy wallet.\" One of the biggest highlights of this event is to showcase this family. Here's the kicker- The staff that actually took care of the selected RMHC of Arkoma families - us who make $11/hr receive NO recognition. We don't even get invited. The people getting clapped at these galas are the hypocrites in the leadership team who work behind the scenes. They never had the parents cry on their shoulder, ask for help, or even comfort them when their child is still not breathing on his own. Even leadershhip staff from a different location get to attend. It was infuriating and confusing. This company just leaches off of college student cheap labor. Tori who is on the leadership team comes in 20 minutes late allll the time too. Enough was enough. I can't be in a company that will leach off of my hospitality and hard work to their own advantage."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance":
