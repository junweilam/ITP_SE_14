You will thank me later as you will receive zero comp time for the overtime you will be putting in. Other duties as assigned will become your mantra here. Upper management firmly believes that idle hands are the devils workshop, and if you are sitting quietly in your office you obviously need more work to do. Make sure you keep a change of clothes and shoes you don't mind getting dirty, along with a towel etc. You will be ruining several sets of clothes. You will be working with leaking lead acid batteries, getting covered with fiberglass insulation, and animal feces and as a result you will be showering often. Also make sure you are good at showering quickly because they will be calling your phone repeatedly to ask where you are and demand you get back to your office. Please be aware if you need to run an errand they will not allow you time off even if using PTO for it. If you can plan an errand in advance it is best to explain it as a doctor or dentist appointment and schedule it as such. Also vacation time is another sore subject. If you ask to use a week of vacation time during the slow season, you may be told \"the department is too small to allow for it.\" The solution it seems is to let your vacation days expire."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Director of Admissions in Young Harris, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small environment with driven people", "cons": "Isolated in North Georgia Mountain"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Disappointing Developments", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Young Harris, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful faculty and students despite the lack of administrative support and empathy.", "cons": "Lack of support and empathy.
