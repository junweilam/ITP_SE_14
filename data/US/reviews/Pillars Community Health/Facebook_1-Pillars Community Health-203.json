Training is a joke. Expect to basically train yourself. To be honest, the salary isn\u2019t great. You can make more money with sales or even working for Uber. If you drive to work, expect to be moving your car constantly and expect to receive tickets because you cant park for more than two hours in the same spot. Or other employees/ clients park poorly so they take up double the parking space. you get a lot of clients (1-3 new clients each week). If you don\u2019t meet productivity you\u2019ll get more clients. More clients equal more paperwork, more deadlines. Policies and protocols are always changing so expect little consistency. Supervisors demand a lot from employees and have high expectations. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing something, they kinda manipulate you to do it or they\u2019ll say you\u2019re not being a team player. Everyone stays to themselves for the most part and some offices/employees can be hostile. There\u2019s various unnecessary meetings you have to attend per week/month. Clients are demanding and needy if you don\u2019t set boundaries and sometimes you have to take their calls even on your days off. Supervisors can be biased and often favor other employees. Favored employees who don\u2019t follow protocols, get away with it. If you\u2019re not favored, expect to be informed about your wrong doing. This agency is all about money so they will have their employees bill as much as possible.
