Nothing but 5 stars out of 5. \n\nThis is something you just don't see anymore, which is a shame, so this is very meaningful to me and I appreciate it everyday.\n\nTHEY WANT YOU TO SUCCEED!\n\nThe role itself is unique but you are able to develop your own style on how you approach things, as long as the tasks are done from a day-to-day basis.

In my opinion any positions outside of nursing, physicians and their support staff are viewed as liabilities....not assets to this organization.

It's basically like an episode of MTV Cribs.   Porsche, Mercedes, BMW......at a \"nonprofit.\"  There's very little that's not-for-profit here other than their company structure.  Speaking of the executives, it seems to be a pattern here that they routinely miscalculate or go over budget causing a company-wide panic to save money every 3-5 years.  When they do, look out, they're chopping heads.  Not in the areas they really need to, but in positions that have absolute minuscule impacts on the overall costs of the organization.   If you're so poor at consistently managing budgets, why are you still executives?  Any for profit publicly traded organization would have gutted this executive team and board a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely one of those places where they seem to put who you're friends with before results and performance.  Many times it would be a joke around the office about who was and wasn't being promoted.  Knowing and befriending the right people goes a LONG way here....especially in the upper tiers.   You can chronically under-perform for years and you'll keep getting raises until basically you jump out of the plane with your golden parachute.\r\n\r\nThe toxicity of some of the teams here is truly world class.

All this accomplishes is directors who are spread way too thin and communication gets even worse for the bedside staff. No fair scoring system for yearly evaluations and merit.
