Millions of dollars are squandered on a losing men's basketball team and vanity projects.  In order to prop up enrollments in the short term, career preparation is now emphasized at the expense of core academic programs.

As an instructor, the undergraduate students appear to be running the show and diluting the quality of learning by constantly demanding 'what's going to be on the test', and very often not taking responsibility for their own learning.  As a male instructor in a female-dominated field and psych department, I received little support when holding students accountable for assignments and learning.  Disagreements with the lead faculty, including the Chair and Program Directors, are often met with unnecessary resistance which impede the career progress of their own graduate students.
