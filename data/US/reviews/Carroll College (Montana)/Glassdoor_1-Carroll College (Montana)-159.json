Administration is vindictive and not to be trusted. Health \u201cinsurance\u201d is so bad it\u2019s like not having any at all. Very expensive, $6,000 deductible, and max out of pocket of $11,000! The insurer also regularly refuses to pay for needed care. I once had to write to the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Montana to get them to pay for basic care! Salary is about 40% lower than comparable positions elsewhere, making it difficult to live in the area. Community colleges pay more than Carroll! No efforts to be inclusive of diverse populations and the LGBTQ community. Student body is almost entirely White, and students have too much control over faculty. They act like they pay so much to go there that this should be reason to give them high grades rather than earning their grades. HR is a joke and not at all supportive of faculty. They also regularly break the law by sharing protected information with administration. They will buy out faculty with just enough severance pay to avoid a lawsuit. Even so, several lawsuits have been filed against HR for their unethical behavior. \nThis institution was the absolute worst managed institution I\u2019ve experienced in my entire 25-year career."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "low pay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Digital Media Assistant in Great Falls, MT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The hours are flexible and the experience is good.", "cons": "The pay is extremely low."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Unprofessional faculty and staff", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Helena, MT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "none. unless you like guns, uggos, bad restaurants, and such high altitude that will constantly bring you down", "cons": "pretend professionalism, lack of research by faculty, provincial morals, low pay, expectation to the academic protocols only for outsiders"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Will run you ragged", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Instructor in Helena, MT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some students are wonderful and make the job worth doing, departmental faculty are great", "cons": "Teaching becomes a nightmare with only your department (if you're lucky) and a few great students holding you afloat.\r\nIntradepartmental faculty made the job far more challenging for years. \r\nStudents complain and harass instructors like I've never seen before, with no consequences due to school in scary debt.
