Develop/refine your marketing/selling skills; to a point.", "cons": "From a PM specific perspective: A lack of individual product manager empowerment/ownership to measurably move the needle over a given product/feature, parts of a journey, outcomes, or organizational buy-in for what that those would require in terms of power-sharing, leadership, and execution from other departments/divisions. Opportunities/problems to be addressed and prioritization are almost all identified at the top (sometimes from outside the group), with no human centered design practices/processes to validate/refine them with internal and external stakeholders (including patients). More of a traditional business analyst role than a product management role. Which impacts roles/responsibilities, skills, processes, frameworks, etc. And there's a general lack of direct first hand experience or knowledge to understand those differences or teach/drive adoption of current state product management practices/frameworks/techniques. Focus on outputs not outcomes. You're directed to quickly work on the delivery of specific solutions (top down), but often the underlying opportunities/problems haven't been fully refined/vetted and the desired solutions often require process/operational changes/change management for which buy-in has not been secured before committing to solutions. There is little/no development in house so you're not building/enhancing anything internally you're usually configuring something to meet specs you were handed. If there's any customization (there usually is) then you're at the mercy of PMs at the vendor/partner to prioritize your needs. Those PMs/vendors are less likely to prioritize that work as it likely hasn't been vetted with day to day users, will require significant refinement from them, and see the next point below. Partner/vendor relationship management focuses on the short term not the long term; obtaining maximum value at the lowest cost. Less thought to defining achievable and measurable success criteria/metrics before committing to addressing an opportunity/problem or in selecting from among potential solutions. Little to no coaching or structured development. Observed patterns of behavior that can adversely impact performance, morale, psychological safety, and retention: Shouting, over-selling (rather than a focus on honest and transparent communication), cliques, shouting, and micromanagement."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Highly bureaucratic", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Project Manager in Columbia, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some devoted smart people to work which makes coming to work more pleasant.", "cons": "Many corporate silos and infighting throughout management which makes getting things done nearly impossible.

We have access to medical records from other MedStar Health appointments though there is rarely time to search for records and the application isn't easy to use. MedStar has equipment that most other clinics do not: ZeroG, exoskeleton, driver rehab simulations, a working kitchen. If there is a medical emergency, which happens frequently, we can call a rapid response and medical teams will be over in about 5 min. There is very generous time off though it accrues painfully slow. There is no deductible, low premiums, and low copays for the MedStar Health appointments though it can take hours to schedule health appointments. MedStar has maternal and childcare benefits too. Patients are seen one on one and the expectation is 7 patients or 30 units/day (which is surprisingly rarely met as no show/cancellation rate is about 30% due to systemic barriers and almost all patients are Medicare or Medicaid). We have patient insurance specialists and schedulers to assist clinicians.", "cons": "What they say and what they do are entirely opposite. The management cares about profits over anything else and profits come before patients and definitely before associates. Therefore, turnover and burnout is a significant issue. We had 8 people leave in just 1 month and they can never hire quickly enough so remaining clinicians are stuck scrambling. They don't take any accountability in turnover and instead say the clinicians \"lost their passion.\" They tend to replace incredibly skilled clinicians with new grads despite treating the most medically and socially complex patients and therefore clinicians are put in a vulnerable position where they have to treat complicated patients without mentorship. Management is quick to throw clinicians under the bus in front of patients and their families even if they were not present for the event in question. You are expected to be available at all times to take patients and often you are given other evals or treatments when patients do not show. Patients often come incredibly late or on the wrong day and nobody is supposed to be turned away so someone is supposed to see them. The DEI group EPIC is given no real power and associates of color are treated so poorly. Microaggressions and macroaggressions are everywhere. The management takes zero accountability for unsafe/uncomfortable situations or systemic barriers to care and blames clinicians or patients for everything. I had a patient fall because MedStar failed to notify patients of construction. My director said that because the patient has fallen before and nobody made them walk through the grass, that MedStar had no responsibility. When you ask for help you are ridiculed, scoffed at and shamed. They reward poor leadership and poor ethics and punish innovation. They are reactive instead of proactive and often action takes months to years if it ever comes. There are tons of extra job duties without being given time to do them like peer reviews every quarter (have to read all of the notes for a Medicare and non-Medicare caseload and fill out a long survey about it to rate each other's documentation), being a part of a committee to make improvements to operations, tracking and reporting productivity manually. They rarely monetarily reward hard work (if you get a good Google review, which most patients cannot figure out how to do, then you are entered in a raffle to earn $10; you get $15 for every extra patient seen but it is nearly impossible with our cancellation rates; almost everyone gets the standard 3% raise each year since only 2 can get a 6% raise and the past two years they haven't done that due to COVID.) They do not track COVID cases among outpatient patients or associates so that they can brag that there was no transmission of COVID-19 anywhere in the network ever during the pandemic despite many of my colleagues and I getting it. For the longest time we were not even able to get tested if we were asymptomatic. They care more about optics than true safety."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "RN", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Olney, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There was a lot of overtime offered", "cons": "They can be short staffed at times"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great establishment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great staff, great environment, a great place to start", "cons": "Pay could be better/ more fair"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Run Away", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay- this is the only thing that draws victims in.", "cons": "Management very unprofessional, rude .

The most optimistic interpretation of this person's behavior toward me is that they decided, after getting to know me, that I was not the right person for the role: I am an energetic, imaginative person with a drive to deeply comprehend the fundamentals and improve the processes of my work, and it seems they wanted a pliable, teachable person who could learn to work with their extreme expectations on details without being too meta-analytical or process improvement-oriented.

I was holding up well under this onslaught, doing my job well and making sure my actual boss knew it, but it made me miserable to be there so I quit.  I don't want to speak too broadly: it is possible that in their next hire attempts, this person may find exactly the \"moldable clay\" person that they're looking for, and it could be a match made in heaven. But it did not seem like my teammates particularly enjoyed working with this person either, so I don't think I'm crazy to note that a) I was treated pretty poorly when I should have been treated as a talented asset that perhaps belonged in a different role, and b) relatively few professionals would enjoy this person's approach to editing. \r\n\r\nThe work processes of my team did not use the most efficient, modern approaches, probably a function of this person's contentment with the status quo. The deliverables of my team were focused on measures of quality that were both superficial and obscure. A lot of time was spent dotting i's that I was not convinced mattered much to the client or regulators. It was frustrating how often we had to swallow the best actual products of our team's expertise due to the extreme narrowness of our scope. \r\n\r\nAs to the center at large, it is mostly doing incrementalist rather than transformative work. While this has proved a solid strategy for it to get grants, it feels like opportunities to study the most pressing human factors concerns in the healthcare system were not always being seized.

We all are aware that cash is needed in order to fund the mission, but somewhere along the line money became the unwritten mission here. There are bi-annual surveys of employees, but what the employees say and the resulting \"solutions\" do not correlate. If senior management is criticized, they brush it off as employees not understanding them or their jobs. \r\n\r\nI could deal with the problems if it didn't seem as if there are constant contradictory messages, and practices, depending on who you are. For example, we are given measly raises (the last one was 1.25%) and told to be happy because we have a job. However, published reports state that the CEO makes $3 million per year just in SALARY. This does not include other perks and benefits that exceed $1 million. Also, doctors are kings here so they are used to having temper tantrums if anyone tells them they are wrong (especially if they are high revenue generators).  \r\n\r\nAlso, the party line from senior management is that there is no money for needed additional personnel or software. However, there is money for consultants and outsourcing of essential jobs.

Zero support when you are attacked by patients and family members, in fact they ask the nurses what they could have done differently!

Upper management doesnt care.\r\nOver looked for annual increase due to a old write up from 2 years ago. They have done some other's like this as well. So, on the actual pdf that was include in my raise titled \"Compensation Annual Pay Review\u201d.Individual increase amounts are based on multiple factors: Key Performance Indicator (KPI)\r\nresults, demonstration of job responsibilities, and your contributions to the team in 2020. The KPI's this company used are broken and dont report accurately or dont report at all. As for the Demonstration for job responsibilities I was promoted from a Level I to Level II in 2020. I have been with the company a long time and my contributions have been outstanding with a year of awards. There is NO word of PCA mentioned to me at all in this pdf. Went to upper management about this and was told NO RAISE. Sent HR an email on this issue and got no response. This company doesn't live up to the mission of the Promise."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "n/A", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Registered Respiratory Therapist in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great benefits, pay and coworkers", "cons": "They have staffing issues frequently"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Starting Pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Nurse Residency in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You know up front salary and contract length.", "cons": "None so far at this time"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good, not great.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Patient Navigator in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They offered great health insurance benefits", "cons": "There was hardly any room for growth."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Nurse", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay good hours I like", "cons": "No break no time dislike"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Don\u2019t put yourself thru this", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Certified Pharmacy Technician in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is great\u2026 it has to be to convince anyone to sign on.", "cons": "Culture is horrendous.
