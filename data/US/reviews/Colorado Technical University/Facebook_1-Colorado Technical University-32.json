The whispers of poor business practices in the Admissions, Financial Aid and Advising departments are well-founded, as there's no real accountability if an employee is slacking or providing students with misinformation. Management seems concerned with student attrition and not much else, as raise freezes were placed in 2012 and, as I understand it, have not yet been removed. I was promised a pay increase of 4% at the start of 2012, and by September of 2013 was promised it again with no implementation.

Not a fan of the temp-to-hire structure either, seems like a revolving door issue (lots of turnover)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Senior Military admissions advisor", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Senior Admissions Military Advisor in Schaumburg, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay,Great team members ,Helps build, professionalism,A chance to go to school for free if you can  make it a year there.", "cons": "Management from the Director level down is inconsistent\n\nYou can't really be of service to your students while be micprmanged and pressured by numbers.

I should have followed my instincts when in the interview I was told they were happy to be down to a 75 percent turnover rate.... That's right only 25 out of every 100 people stays with the company... and they were happy about that since it was down from a close to 100 percent turnover rate.  \r\nThe reason for  the high turnover is what the job entails.... You're title is Admissions Advisor... what you are  is a telemarketer...  Your job is to get EVERYONE who gets passed to  you via call screener to enroll.  The only people that they will not accept (as long as  they have the $50 admissions fee) is if you do not have your high school diploma or ged....   You have the fee and the GED you get in.  This does not sound bad, however we were told even IF the potential student could not benefit from what we offered (i.e. the wanted to be a hair dresser) we were to get them to apply.\r\nWe were scolded if we told someone that we could not be of benefit to them.  All  that mattered was the sale.  I had a collegue who asked a potential student which was more important getting his child a christmas gift or spending that 50 on getting into school...... \r\n\r\nAnother aspect is how they get their potential students.  They use VERY deceptive advertising.  Did you ever see the \"Obama wants to pay you to go back to school\" adds... if you are silly enough to answer them.. you would get a call back within 5 minutes from our screeners.  Even if  you told them you did not want to talk to someone, as long as you answered 3 questions you were passed through.  Many times I would get a call from the screener passing someone who was screeming in  the background not to pass him over.  Now unless you told me to take  you off our list, even if you said no, hung up, called me names... you would keep getting calls from us.\r\n\r\nI guess I saw admissions rep as something differennt from what they did.  They saw it striclty as a numbers game... I saw it as a job to get qualified eager students  to enroll...."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Met some good people that I still keep in touch with.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Admissions Advisor in Downers Grove, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, pretty good pay.

And the combination of my degrees did not equate to the cost of just the tuition of CTU bachelors degree which is around 60K. They expect you to sell this to a non traditional student (someone who is older, has a family, bills ect) these people are their bread and butter because they are in desperate situations and the \"admissions\" advisor is suppose to \"help them make a decision to bridge the gap between where they are and where they want to be\" (laughing) this is apart of the admissions \"script\" yes I said script. They have a script that the admission advisors follow with rebuttals (aka overcoming objections) to close the deal. The staff is divided up into teams and they compete to see who can enroll the most students. Very soon they will no longer have associate degree programs and only bachelors, masters, and doctoral programs. Obviously because they are more money for the company. They expect you to hit your \"start\" goal in other words there are quotas that the Admission Advisors have to hit in order to remain an employee (but this is not a \"sales job\") Next the training. The training is long and intense. Why? So each lead they pay for (ranging up to 3k per lead) gets turned over to a sale ooops I mean start (aka 60k investment). But wait there is more! A good number of the admission advisors do not have......A DEGREE THEMSELVES!! Really so you are \"advising\" these students on the benefits of what a quality education can do for you and you do not even possess what you are marketing?! This is great for tangible things such as a car or a home but something that is intangible like education?! Absolutely not. I was more qualified than my Director! Now lets talk about something else. Financial Aid. Once a student get to that part its tricky. They have three paces for students but ideally they want them to go on whats called a \"career pace\" which is accelerated. This winds up costing the student more $ on the front end because of how Financial Aid is packaged. They also encourage their \"advisors\" to still enroll students After a start date because they have a less likelihood of canceling (cleaver). Advisors are suppose to be real world faulity and industry professionals (yeah okay) my trainer revealed she is also a professor at CTU....Umm okay that is interesting. My time there was very short lived. I tripled my sales goal for the month in less than a week (because I know how to sell) then I realized how severely UNDERCOMPENSATED I was getting due to my qualifications ( I possess a Masters Degree from a Traditional University) and I am working with people that do not have an associates degree  but advising PhD students. When I left I gave my proper notification (i got a real job educating students at a college in person) and wanted to finish starting the students I enrolled to get them off on a good foot but my Director to me to leave in the middle of the day since I gave my notice (how classy). I was in shock because I thought giving proper notice is what is suppose to be done but I was penalized for following protocol and told to vacate the building immediately that my LEADS aka students will be handed over to other \"team members\". No good luck, it was a pleasure having you, Nothing. This was very low class of the company and this left a very bad taste in my mouth about the entire Career Education Corporation company as a whole. My best advice to anyone there. Realize that EVERYONE in the sales department ( i mean admissions) is Disposable at any time. There is a Reason as to why they go through so many staffing agencies and have training classes every two weeks. Think about it and go into each day as if it is your last.

They have all of the admissions snowballed and they fire people based on a way they say a phrase on the phone or a certain word. It is truly saddening for me to look back on all of the valuable employees that came and went about something so little. This is a metrics based position. The students are nothing but dollar signs. They literally encourage us to not give up and continue stalking and calling students three times a day every single day. Plain and simple, if someone wants to start school, they will. If they cancel, the admissions advisor is held responsible and during your monthly scorecard review and start recap you have to explain what you did wrong and how to correct it. People are literally afraid to lose their job here, and when a person feels threatened, they aren't as willing to perform and it could hinder them. To anyone out there considering working for CTU, please understand that it is a highly stressful job and people that work within the admissions department will definitely tell you just how ridiculous it truly is.

There is a heavy focus on keeping students in no matter what condition they are in.  Students with illnesses, emergencies, the focus is on keeping the students in no matter what.  We call the same students who are not submitting assignments and end up on the same list almost every day for them to submit something... anything. They militantly do not promote from within and hire weak candidates from the outside which hurts the department.  This leads to confused managers who don't know how the department operates.  This creates a very management 101 environment, and they have hired a lot of 'admissions advisor mangers'  who have turned the department very much admissions adviser salesly.  There is an insane excess of meetings.  If you love meetings you will enjoy seeing your day swallowed by them so  that you cannot get your work done. The metrics are also very baffling with most focus on retention and an arbitrary amount of students handed out and the luck of the draw if they are good or don't have computers or access to a library.  Raises do not happen or are very small.  It is almost  impossible to move to another department once in advising as it is basically a career deadzone.. Decisions that the company makes seem to come randomly even if catastrophic. New tasks are added on every day with an ever expanding job description.

Competition is egged on by the management team and the leadership team tends to turn a blind eye to management bulling advisors and singling out those that do not fit into the \u201cgood old boys club\u201d. The chance of advancement is based on how much management \"likes\" you vrs how well you complete your job duties. Management shows a significant lacks of training and support as well as direction. Overall the hostile work environment on top of the \u201cgood old boys club\u201d within management (all the way up from the Campus Director of Admissions, Student Manager Specialist, to the VP's) are not conductive to increased productivity on the floor. Scare tactics are used on a daily basis to hit or over achieve your monthly budget of students to enroll.  If you are unable to hit the required budget of students that need to be enrolled and started in classes and you score poorly (under a specific %) on your score card you are in fear of being fired.  Management holds these \"set numbers\" over advisors heads and remind them on a daily basis about the personal performance plan (PIP) that they will be placed on to show improvement within 30-60-90 days. However, when working with individuals there is no \u201cguarantee\u201d that the students that are enrolled by the advisor will be able to start classes. Admissions advisors are not in control of student\u2019s financial aid, or if the timing is off and they are not able to start classes due to emergencies or life events. Regardless of why the student decides to withdraw or cancel their enrollment, the advisor is still held responsible for the overall number (required budget) of students who need to start classes. When an advisor takes a vacation they are still required to maintain the same budget of student\u2019s to enroll and start in classes. This can also lower the number of students enrolled which could lead to the advisor being placed on a \u201cPIP\u201d or \u201cfired for lack of productivity\u201d. Advisors are required to use a script when talking with students and can be fired if they say too much or too little. Each call is recorded and the management team reviews each call looking for ways to either assist the advisor in talking with students or in some scary cases to single out advisors that are not in the \u201cgood old boys club\u201d to find any reason (breaking the rules of the road \u2013 which includes bonding too much with a student) to fire them Truly if it was not for upper management this would be a GREAT place to work.
