OSU provides a discount on your selected meal plan at around 35%. Every year, RA's have the opportunity to apply to switch to another building/complex on campus \u2013\u00a0a process made easier if you get to know the Hall Director in the complex you are hoping to move to. RA's also receive a \"stipend\" of less than $100 per week. Being an RA looks good on a resume and you will recieve a lot of training on diversity and other topics that employers will appreciate. You will also deal with potentially intense situations that make for great lessons learned for a young person. About 90% of the time recruiters know of and respect the role. The other 10% of recruiters may have partied a little in school and will immediately perceive you as a narc, or tattletale, that is uptight and can't have fun. You won't know which type you are talking to until you've presented the fact that you are an RA, and in at least one intance, I think that being an RA severaly damaged a relationship with a professional connection that could have turned into an internship and possibly a full-time offer. This will be the case everywhere with this role \u2013 not everyone has fond memories of/with their college RA's! Be an RA that they will remember fondly, though, and you can have a hand in shaping that perception for the future generations.", "cons": "Ohio State RA's who work another campus job will be disappointed to find out that their hours may be limited in their other role. There are two reasons for this. (1) University HR dictates that students can only work 28 hours/week at maximum, and (2) the Office of Residence Life \u2013 under which RA's are technically hired \u2013 believes that the RA role may take as much as 20 hours of time per week. The HR restriction is based on what I believe is state law \u2013\u00a0working more than 28 hours per week, at least at Ohio State, incurrs a requirement that the employer must provide full benefits to the employee. The 20 hours/week rule set by Residence Life is truly ridiculous, and would be the easiest for OSU to solve. No RA is ever putting in 20 hour weeks. If you were to include the hours spent on \"on call\" shifts (which technically run 12 hours, from 7p to 7a), then you could easily approach this hour count \u2013 two shifts scheduled in a week would put you there \u2013 but in reality, time actively spent on rounds and supporting residents \u2013 assuming you are doing your job as an RA PERFECTLY, being a dream staff member \u2013 couldn't possibly pass the five or six hour mark per week. Residence Life calls your weekly pay (a figure under $100/week, as mentioned above) a stipend, but has sollaborated to HR to make sure you are actually being paid hourly \u2013 you MUST log 20 hours/week to receive your \"stipend,\" which, at the hourly rate, breaks out to less than $5 per hour. The tragic thing about this is that most students applying to be RA's are enticed by the free housing. Generally, RA's at any school come from low income (or low/no financial support from family) backgrounds, and DO have at least one other campus job \u2013 and of course, the minumum wage is far above $5 an hour \u2013 the hourly \"stipend\" rate mentioned above. Not to mention that most other jobs on campus are Federal Work Study roles with a standard pay rate of $10/hour. Over my several years as an RA I will have missed out on several thousand dollars that I could have made \u2013 and could easily have worked in addition to my classes and RA role \u2013 because of the silly 20 hour/week rule set by Residence Life. The only time I ever called OSU HR to seek a solution to this issue, I was told by a particularly rude representative that they would \"never understand kids like me,\" because we \"want to work all through college and miss out on the college experience that will ultiamtely shape our futures.\" The message was that I am working too hard and needed to take time to enjoy myself \u2013 and it was communicated in an attitude that was belittling, by an older adult who clearly still perceived me to be a child confused about their priorities. It upset them greatly when I informed them that I had a third, off-campus job. To a significant population of hard working students at this school, a true 28 hour work week would be doable. The RA required hour count needs to be dropped to 5 or 10 hours/week. Don't get me wrong... As the title suggests, the benefits of this role outweigh the costs... free housing is worth thousands, and a discount on food and access to university dining facilities as an upperclassman is a huge time savings \u2013 but prepare to be a little strapped for cash if you have been working another university role and are preparing to become an RA at OSU."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great work culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Machine Learning Engineer in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Was able to do my work on my own time and speed before the deadlines", "cons": "Non work from office work"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Busy work all the time", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule, they worked around class schedules.", "cons": "Busy, mindless work.

Campus is beautiful.", "cons": "Parking - I have to pay over $1,000 per year, and OSU refuses to pay for it. Salary is terrible. I'm required to have a Masters degree, which is the case for most entry-level positions in Student Life. It takes forever to move up, so when someone does get a higher level position, they never leave. Which means it is hard for others to move up. So much of your experience in dependent on the department you work in. Student Life is completely dysfunctional - 7 people from my area got fired for negligence. There were multiple scandals that hit the news as well. They have a lot of people in leadership who have no idea what they are doing, and no idea what the people below them are doing. There is a major hiring bias that favors minorities - I have been on search committees where we were literally told \"you have to pick a black person.\" Tokenizing to the max. Residence Life is probably the worst unit in all of Student Life - such incompetent staff and top-heavy...horrific working with them.\r\n\r\nThe University just gave grad students major increases to stipends, so now they make more than many of their full-time supervisors. The University keeps chipping way at benefits - they cut the tuition benefit during the pandemic that is mostly utilized by the same people putting themselves at risk to keep the university open during the pandemic, and after people had already registered for classes...there was so much outrage that they reversed it. But if you're thinking of taking a job due to the tuition benefit...be aware they will probably cut it again.\r\n\r\nThere are no perks. I had to pay a monthly fee if I wanted to drink out of the water cooler. I also was asked to pay money to attend the staff holiday party. I'm so tired of being paid poorly and getting nickeled and dimed. I have interacted with the new President multiple times, and she clearly does not care about staff. It's all about the faculty. Even when pressed, she has nothing to say about the staff. HR is horrific - do not trust any of them. They have a strangle-hold on everything. Awhile back they did some new HR transformation that was supposed to increase efficiency and streamlining. Not a single HR downsize happened - they all walked away with higher titles and huge pay increases. These are the same people who are screwing over their own units during the University-wide Career Roadmap. They act like this will be some big pay equity thing for staff, when in reality all it is, is an excuse for them to downgrade staff and their \"inflated job titles\" which is actually a direct quote from a University Senate Finance report. Sure, they may bump some people up in pay, but they are then going to make the same amount of money as someone who just came into the University. Years of service, education, etc. aren't being taken into account in Career Roadmap, which is insulting. And the rest of us will be told we make too much (LOL) and will lose our ability to get pittance equity increases to our base pay. \r\n\r\nIf your unit is not flush with cash, you'll never get a better job. I've been told by numerous supervisors they wish they could promote me, but they don't have the money. And I never get any higher up positions in other units, because they always hire their own people. They are so bad with internal candidates here it isn't funny. Many of the jobs posted are already intended for someone, but they don't have the decency to mention that on the job posting. If you want to move up, you have to move out."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5,
