Manager went on vacation during my second week. I continued taking phone calls and running reports like I had been shown how to do during this time. Was barely given any tasks by the Supervisor. Then Dept. Manager came back and was upset with me for answering the phones and not knowing more even though the Supervisor was well aware I was answering the phones. -Dept. Manager kept changing the rules on whether I was allowed to answer the phone or not. One day I could. The next, not. Then the next day I would be allowed to answer voicemails. Then the next day I couldn't answer the phone at all. Then I was told to answer calls but put them all on hold immediately. Then some days I was told not to answer the phone at all but then told I should answer it if it seemed like no one was going to pick it up. -Dept. Manager would micromanage. They would hear someone assisting me with how to do something and literally interrupt and tell me the exact thing the other person had just said. -I expressed at 3 different times that I was concerned I was not finishing a certain task fast enough and I was never given any advice/criticism other than to focus on quality vs quantity. Then one day I was working on this task and the Dept. Manager said, \"I would have had those all done by now.\" but still never addressed my concerns. -No one seemed to know when we would get to leave. The Dept. Manager would stay later almost every night and other employees would whisper about when they thought they would be able to go home. Because I was new I would stay until I was told I could go, which was usually 30-45min after we were scheduled to leave. -One day I copied a set of notes for a task that the Dept Manager had given me. I didn't change anything from the original notes, but I did number the steps and at the bottom of the page I wrote out what each step meant because I didn't want to make any mistakes the next time I was asked to do this task. I told the Dept. Manager I did this and they became upset with me and told me I couldn't personalize my own personal notes. They looked at the new notes and told me the notes were now wrong. I asked the Dept. Manager to show me where the notes were wrong and reiterated I didn't change anything from the notes they had given me. The Dept. Manager just stared at me for a moment, clearly upset, said \"Okay.\" and walked away. -A couple days after that last incident I came to work and was abruptly let go. I asked why they were letting me go since I was given little to no criticism on my performance. I was told that I didn't go to the Dept. Manager \"enough\" to ask what I should be doing (although I was always busy working on something) and was told the Dept. Manager didn't see me using my notes \"enough\". When I tried to argue that these reasons didn't make sense because I could easily point out several times just that week that I did those very things, I was dismissed and told \"It's just not good fit.\""}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Fine job in between career search", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Residential Life in Worcester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Health Benefits, Coworkers, Community, Connections,", "cons": "Didn\u2019t listen to students back when, needed change of leadership for school"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Nice Students", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Associate Professor in Worcester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Students are hard working good kids and a pleasure to teach", "cons": "Course load a bit high"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Positive experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Student Worker in Worcester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- flexible schedule -
