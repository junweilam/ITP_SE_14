Despite attending trainings like \"Diversity and Inclusion\" and \"How to foster growth on your team,\" they do very little to boost their staff up. Most of the time, staff end of feeling demoralized and burned out when interacting with management. Most entry level staff are people of color, and there is a very stark difference in how white individuals and people of color are treated. Most managers are white, and they very much pretend to care about reducing racial oppression. When it comes to actually redistributing power in the working relationship in order to create a healthier dynamic, they refuse to institute practices that would foster that type of relationship. Most managers react to disagreement through very punitive means, like writing staff up for insubordination instead of changing problematic practices that hurt staff and lead to staff acting out. Additionally, I have seen managers cover for other managers who have sexually harassed other employees in the workplace. When I tried to address my own relationship with the same employee to a senior manager, she shut the conversation down. It felt like she was more interested in protecting the person who had sexually harassed a number of people on the team instead of asking how I was affected by working alongside with a problematic person for several years.

What did not change was the territorial nature. I was met with suspicion by some staff members, it was a \"prove yourself\" vibe. While at first it was a less intense environment, senior management became more involved to increase productivity and remove the autonomy of the HOTT program and re-organize the case management department under the umbrella of the \"adult program.\" Your work became strongly scrutinized, especially the amount of encounters. Middle management was expanded and a direct supervisor hired to  manage the case managers.  HOTT program management monitored your schedule and work, often met with a director to scrutinize activities. Punitive actions (write-ups) were more common.  Case management was not well respected amongst some of the team members, a hierarchy was clear. Case management disproportionally faced constant change. Feedback was often interpreted as combative; it became difficult to work in an environment so focused on productivity. The number of our face to face encounters was prominently displayed each month during our weekly all staff, treatment team meetings. I came to dread those weekly meetings. \r\nOther cons:\r\nNot everyone in upper management is committed to the mission. \r\nMedical staff received wine and fancy baked goods during the holidays while most of the other staff got candy and chocolates.
