There is no incentive to do a good job, in fact they simply want you to get done fast.

The employees that have been of service for any amount of time are literally unhappy, more likely unable to get a job elsewhere than anything else. There is no \"I\" in team, nor is there any \"team\" in team in the Patient Access Department. It is almost like a contest to see who can \"tattle\" on who the fastest, the one with the largest knife in your back wins, sadly though, they win nothing. There is nothing to be gained. The raise is at best $0.25 per year, a Christmas \"bonus\" that was cut in half from a year ago at a \"FOR\" profit hospital. There is absolutely no \"care\" in healthcare unless you truly care about the patients you're trying to help, because it is not only not rewarded, if you don't follow ridiculous, and again ineffectual protocol, you can actually be reprimanded for helping a patient. I worked with someone that left their \"designated area\" for 45 seconds to grab an elderly patient a blanket. For this employees trouble, they were lectured by two members of management for 45 minutes about leaving their \"designated area.\" They were taken away from thei \"designated area for SIXTY TIMES the amount of time it took to help ONE patient by TWO managers. It is simply sad. Employees are micromanaged by bitter management, that likely went through the same things themselves.
