They do a lot of good in the countries they are based in, and they have a large staff of highly qualified global health equity experts. Overall Partners In Health values the opinions and life experience of staff who live in the countries they work in rather than making sweeping assumptions on how the US can help \"less developed\" countries to consciously try to avoid the white savior complex I have always admired the focus Partners In Health places on centering their work in areas where communities have the least support. By starting administering aid in areas that need it most, PIH tries to solve some of the most difficult problems first, even when it is more difficult to prove the value they provide than if the organization decided to work closer to areas with more resources at the start All this said - These are reasons I admire the mission of Partners In Health, however when I began working there I started to understand why people say you shouldn't meet your idols because they are never quite what they appear to be when they're behind closed doors", "cons": "I found a lot of the behind the scenes of Partners in Health to be at best disorganized, with thoroughly lackluster onboarding and initial training. The training that new employees do receive is not typically organized through HR, but instead vary greatly depending on the department you join who create their own onboarding materials. I felt I was not given enough information to understand how the parts of the organization which were relevant to my role connected to each other, let alone the overall organization functioned. I worked remotely out of the Boston office (the main US headquarters), working closely with C-level executives as well as representatives of all the countries that Partners In Health has sites in. I was never given any cultural competency training prior to interacting with these high level medical professionals or well known governmental figures. I tried to tread carefully to maintain respect across cultures, but cultural sensitivity/competency training is the absolute least PIH could do to prepare the staff who will be interacting with those working on site in such varied parts of the world. Unfortunately, I also encountered inter-departmental conflicts (more similar to high school drama than to a professional workplace), that my colleagues openly referred to as an ongoing roadblock for collaboration between the teams. Allowing contentious relationships between teams is never going to be conducive to true collaboration, and the insistence on traditional \"professionalism\" in the org seemed to come to the detriment of real, human communication that could actually address interpersonal problems. Communication between departments within the US office was essential to keeping projects running smoothly, but there was rarely a shared understanding of what other departments were working on, which I would imagine leads to a lot of the same work being done by multiple people who don't know of other initiatives. There was a lot of talk in my time there about \"streamlining work flows,\" \"sharing resources,\" and \"increasing communication\" between different US departments and between the different country sites, but I never saw any true effort coming from the top to facilitate this There are many die-hard employees at PIH (PIHers) who have been in their roles for decades, which adds a lot of value to the org, but can also give an impression that there are different tiers of employees who receive different levels of respect or who are viewed as more or less valuable based on their tenure, which can leave new employees by the wayside to figure things out on their own rather than \"bother\" more experienced staff - Laying a foundational understanding that some people's time was definitionally worth more than others even when they are on the same team"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and

Sadly, a few sour apples are ruining the bunch -- especially in the Boston office. Shortly after moving into a beautiful new office space in Back Bay, we learned the organization was in a massive budget crisis, and a hiring and travel freeze was put in place. Morale plummeted as numerous colleagues and friends were laid off, fired, or just jumped ship. Now that we are \"running lean,\" work-life balance seems a figment of the imagination, and a formerly collaborative and friendly environment has shifted to a stressful \"every man for himself\" situation. While the shake-up in staff hasn't been completely terrible, and we are now bringing in new hires who all seem to be pretty great, there remains little opportunity for advancement for those who have weathered the storm (unless your boss jumps ship, and you're left trying to pick up the pieces). There is very little investment in supporting people's professional development, or even trying to help inexperienced managers acclimate to roles that fell unexpectedly into their laps. Many managers are wonderful, a few are horrible, and there is no real way to address any problems. For all the talk of diversity and inclusion, empowering the little guy, and social justice -- the Boston office is oppressively hierarchical. Whatever the boss-man says, goes -- even if it's obviously not the right move, may be hurting more than it's helping, or could potentially be out of alignment with MA employment law. When people raise concerns about unfair treatment or inconsistent application of policy, they are shut down, shut out, and essentially gaslighted until they leave on their own or are fired.\r\n\r\nHR is truly horrific. I second the other reviewer's report on HR participating in name-calling, having experienced this first-hand on a number of occasions. While there is one guy in that department who is truly wonderful, warm, compassionate, and has a sincere desire to help -- he has no real power to affect change, even when he tries. Others on his team are either woefully incompetent or seem to be in willful denial of any problems that come to their attention. Serious procedures you would absolutely expect to have a policy guiding their implementation are completely devoid of such. If a manager wants to get back at an employee for raising genuine concerns in a diplomatic way, that manager can definitely do that with impunity. Employees have to beg and plead for help from HR, only to discover that such assistance, if provided, is hollow at best -- and at worst, could completely backfire, making matters worse than they already were."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Very bad environment in the Boston office", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The mission to help the poor of many countries is strong and important to support. the vision of the founders is innovative and unique.\r\ngood place to get an immersion in global health, but would be much better to get an opportunity in one of the country-based programs rather than in this US office.", "cons": "CEO is unable to manage the toxic work environment in the expensive-to-lease Boston office.
