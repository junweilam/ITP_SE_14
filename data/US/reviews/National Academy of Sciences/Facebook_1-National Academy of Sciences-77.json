Yes, you will have the change to work on numerous \"cool projects\" and engage with influential stakeholders. However, given the structure of the work of The National Academies, you as an employee will either become an events manager or implementer of the expert guidance of stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThis could use some explanation. The primary types of projects at The National Academies are: Consensus Studies or Forums/Roundtables. \r\n\r\nFor consensus studies, you will have a unique opportunity to take a deep dive into a contentious policy issue. While you might have some creative independence in what to research or how to structure arguments, the intellectual thrust of the studies are drive by a committee of experts that you help recruit. It can be said that by helping structure the committee, you are influencing the perspectives that inform the study.  But this ignores a severe weakness of the organization. As a membership-driven organization, expert committees are required to draft at least one or two members. Furthermore, given the processes that studies are driven by, there is undue preference to select those who have previously served on committees. This leads to the projects being informed by a revolving door of experts, with little to no recruitment of newer expertise or perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe second type of projects are those conducted by Forums and Roundtables - primarily workshops. These are 1 to 1.5 day symposiums in which experts are recruited to discuss a particular topic. The topic that is being discussed is almost always driven by input from members of Forums and Roundtables. This is good in some ways - the main one being that the topic at hand is immediately relevant to the policy space. The downside is that you as an employee will have little opportunities to learn how to identify vital issues in the field as the onus of identifying topics is on the membership. Once a topic is identified, you will once again recruit an expert committee to conceptualize an agenda and identify speakers to invite.  While there may be some opportunities for staff to inform the agenda, it is once again predominantly driven by the experts. Thus, staff are left to the thankless of job of implementing the expert committee's wishes, with few opportunities to learn why the decision was arrived at. \r\n\r\nTL; DR - the main skill you will gain is facilitation. Yes, you will gain exposure to a lot of topics, but your knowledge will be a mile wide, but an inch deep. You will not gain quantitative skills and will barely gain qualitative skills. This is a disastrous recipe to showcase any accomplishments for a job elsewhere. \r\n\r\nIn short stay away. I looked passed negative reviews when I accepted my position here.

If you can, find yourself a research assistant position instead. You'll likely have to do some administrative work but you will be in the program track as a Research Assistant which means you might have a shot at doing work that requires the use of your brain. I didn't mind doing admin work and I didn't mind putting in my time and paying my dues but I never would have taken the job had I known that once you've been labeled as \"admin\" you will never be allowed to do anything else. \r\n\r\nAdmin personnel work very hard--there is a ton of work to be done at that level. You will be expected to work long hours and you will be pressured to underreport your time because they don't want to pay OT to admin personnel. Program staff, on the other hand, are paid exorbitant salaries and can take 2 hour lunches, leave to hang out with their children, work at home as much as they want, and treat everyone else like garbage--all for a premium salary. The Academies value degrees over competent employees. Hard working support staff will never come close to being paid what people in the program track make. \r\n\r\nRacism and sexism also run rampant. If you dare to speak up you will be stripped of the responsibilities you do enjoy and you will be treated worse. Being sexually harassed? Bullied? Is someone treating you badly because you're not white? Are you being asked to underreport hours worked--essentially working for free when you're hardly paid anything to begin with? DONT go to HR. They work for NASEM. They are NOT there to protect you and what you say WILL get back to your superiors. They may not be able to fire you but boy will you have a target on your back. \r\n\r\nIf you decide to take a job here, understand that the only benefit will be the NASEM name on your resume when you go to get another job."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "I've been working here for almost 2 years...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 May 2020", "job_title": "Senior Program Assistant in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pros: build great connections, good benefit packages, and with a good supervisor and team there can be lots of flexibility and opportunity", "cons": "Bureaucratic to the point of slowly killing the organization, no upward mobility unless you have multiple advanced degrees, and more often than not, limited to no support for advancement from senior staff"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Former employee", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Senior Program Associate in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work with some of best people of diverse backgrounds as both colleagues, but also within Academia, government and NGO's.
