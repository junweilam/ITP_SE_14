Many have risen through the ranks without the skill sets, experience, or advanced education necessary to achieve departmental/organizational strengths. Consequently, they are unable to meet the demands of healthcare innovation.\n\nIn addition, Pleasant Valley Hosp (PVH) leadership lacks the ability to think and act collaboratively or creatively. Many are easily threatened by innovation, and undermine new suggestions, research, & progressive analysis. It is very \"old boy's club\" If PVH wants to align with Dignity Health's quest in rebranding itself as the epitome of human kindness--it needs to start with the leadership. This doesn't mean babying the staff/nurses/community physicians--it means holding these professionals accountable to a higher level of standards, behaviors, & professionalism. \n\nBoth PVH & St John's Oxnard also lack a strong ethics committee. Nurses are not encouraged to reach out to an IRB for inappropriate/futile medical management/treatments. Families are allowed to dictate their wishes without the skilled conversations by medical staff  explaining how their agenda can prolong pain and suffering to the patient. It seems that these campuses are stuck in the way healthcare was practiced in the 1980s."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Had a wonderful 13+yrs of employment.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "2 May 2014", "job_title": "Outreach Financial Assistant in Point Pleasant, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great fellow employees and supervisor.
