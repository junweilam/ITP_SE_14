Faculty earn larger standard annual raises than staff. I've seen departments re-organized multiple times (including physical moves) in less than 5 years with little leadership understanding on the impact on people, processes, relationships, and student support. (If you're packing up/unpacking your office, learning and developing new processes, branding materials, etc. you're taking away from student support.) Leadership runs the extremes of instantaneously promoting internally/re-organizing versus allowing teams to go without leaders or do-ers. I've seen huge turnover because leadership would often rather divide responsibilities among remaining staff rather than recruiting new.

No matter how many times myself and others brought up issues, asked for a process to be implemented, or tried to incite change, it was always glazed over or ignored by upper management. Some of us even went so far as to raise issues to HR who simply stated they couldn't get involved in departmental affairs. Everyone is aware of the issues, from group managers to the VP of the department and yet somehow they're still ok with watching amazing employees walk out the door instead of doing everything they can to have them stay. When I left there was essentially a full new team from when I started five years earlier because the turnover is so aggressive. There was no effort made for retention, many of the people who left would have stayed if offered pay raises, promotions, or the issues of the job were addressed. Pay is below average. The only reason I ever got a raise outside of the yearly 2-3% \"merit\" raise is because I had been offered a job elsewhere and was going to take it unless BU could match the offer monetarily. Also, the only reason why work from home was even a consideration was because of the pandemic. Most employees live outside of the city and even though BU is flexible, this seems to be a pain point that can't be properly addressed at a University level. By the time I left I was burnt out. I lost my passion for my craft and I felt drained by BU. The hardest part was leaving my colleagues who became my friends."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good study place", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice Professors and studying environment", "cons": "Harsh finals , but depends on Professors"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "BU Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Research Laboratory Supervisor in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provides Good Benefits\r\nSafe Working Environment", "cons": "Pay is not Competitive with other institutions"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "NA", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Associate Director in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay, benefits, co-workers, students are great!", "cons": "Nothing to note at this time."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Lab Technician in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours for work and understanding", "cons": "Late hours but not that many cons"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "CS131 Course Assistant", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Undergraduate Course Assistant in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "helpful to have mastery of the material", "cons": "can be a lot of work (more than 5-6 hrs that is the estimate)"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great opportunities for research assistants!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many resources, great support system", "cons": "experience strongly depends on PI"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to study!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Dec 2021", "job_title": "PhD Student in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Smart people, a lot of great research going on in biological sciences.", "cons": "The linearity of the campus is slightly strange for a college campus.

The communications office I worked in COMPLETELY turned over two separate times during my four years as a designer \u2013 I even held down the office 100% on my own at one point when all 5 positions left. Directors never last (they tried 3 during my time there). Writers have no freedom and leave from boredom quickly. Design can only be taken so far because the Dean has the final say over EVERYTHING. If you hate micro-managing from higher ups that won't even let you send an email without seeing it, then this is the place for you. Additionally, offices that are supposed to collaborate on large projects are often at odds with each other and do not work well together. There was constant tension and bad blood between offices under the same roof. I will never go back.

It's higher education, so the pay generally isn't as high as in industry. But the tuition benefits help offset this con.\r\n- If your school is small, you will be leaned on for more than traditional assistant duties.
