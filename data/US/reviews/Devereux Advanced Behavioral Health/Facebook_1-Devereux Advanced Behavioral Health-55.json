Devereux will throw any and all staffs under the bus totally disregarding the effort and time you have place in the company and the sacrifices you've made. Management knows about the truth and try to tip-toe around everything. They will never be completely honest with staffs and if you think you will move up in the company, think again.

Company touts a great work and life balance but in reality it is not balanced at all! benefits are a joke. \r\n\r\nInformation is constantly changing even when it is coming from the same person, and is definitely an issue across different employees. Heck, they cannot even agree on a name. It's direct care professional or mental health worker depending on the day of the week and mood of the employee. While it make seem like a silly complaint it just goes to show the inconsistencies and constant state of flux that the company is in.\r\n\r\nThe interviewing process, including the observation, does not really go in-depth on what the job is really like. The director I interviewed with and the staff I observed never discussed how you need to use physical restraints with the clients. When it was mentioned at the beginning of training they glossed over it like it's a \"we're going to teach you but you won't really use it\" kinda attitude. However, once full-shift observations started those of us in training were shocked at how often staff must use restraints on clients. The last day of training we had to practice on each other for over 6 hours! They claimed their techniques do not harm us and we would be fine, but I'm filled with bruises and cannot move my neck. My other co-workers can barely move their backs and knees.\r\n\r\nBasically all the information that was shared during the interview process turned out to be inaccurate. For example,When I did the initial phone interview I was asking about how shifts work. I was told full time must work every single Sat and Sun then two days during the week. This location does not rotate weekends. Doesn't sound like a great life and work balance. Since I'm in school and have class on Sat I asked about the overnight shift. I was told that on overnights I could work Sat and Sun night. However, once I started doing training I learned that most units have a Sunday through Wednesday or a Wednesday through Saturday shift. I was also never told I would have to work alone. Sorry after only observing 3 shifts I do not feel comfortable being alone with 12 clients with physical aggression issues. Another example is when I asked about benefits. I was told that part timers receive benefits yet when they called me to offer the job they stated I would get no benefits. I asked about the information given to me before and he said well only part timers who get over 35 hours get benefits. I wanted to ask \"then why, when you know I was interviewing for a position for less than 35 hours, would you tell me that yes part timers get benefits?\" The last example, and my biggest complaint, is the director asked if there is a particular population that I would not want to work with. I stated that due to my previous work with survivors of sexual assault I may have bias issues and have been recommend by my previous supervisor to not work with sexual offenders. He said that would not be a problem. Yet, during training when I spoke with the scheduler she said that she cannot guarantee that she won't schedule me with the sexual offenders. This was after we were told that we cannot refuse to work at a specific unit or we could be fired. So then why ask if there was a population that I would not want to work with? \r\n\r\nThey claim to offer a great balance between work and life which is a joke. I have a friend who works there and had a fever of 102 and they would not let her leave. That's not great for her health or the kiddos she is working with. She could have passed on the illness she came down with while on her shift. Because of the limited request off slots it is almost impossible to get time off unless you plan a month or more ahead of time. \r\n\r\nYou get no real break on your shift other than a bathroom break. You are expected to eat when the kids are eating or when they are preoccupied with a game or movie. While there are some 8 hour shifts most are 10 hours. If you are working a 10 shift and the incoming shift is not comfortable being left alone right away you have to stay. My overnight shifts are 11:30 pm-9:30 am and I was told to expect to stay until 11. Not easy to do when you've had no real break or time away from the units. \r\n\r\nCompany does not offer holiday pay and if your shift lands on the holiday you have to work it. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to build relationships with co-workers because most of them have a chip on their shoulder. During my first observation shift the guy put one ear bud in and was watching anime instead of getting to know me and talking about the job and unit. The other employee I met did not even acknowledge me for the first 15 minutes. And then she barely spoke to me and wouldn't even look at me. I get it. It's a high turn over rate and so people leave quickly, but treat me with some respect. It really messes with moral when I am trying to learn my job but I'm met with ignorance. \r\n\r\nAnother issue is the stench of this place! Most of the buildings are not really built well for inpatient care. The bedrooms are down long narrow hallways and in dark basements. Not great for monitoring them at night. Each building smells horrible. Like athlete's foot, sweat, and mold. I can't even handle it for a 10 hour shift, so I can't imagine how the children deal with it. Of course the admin building is beautifully built and maintained.\r\n\r\nBasically, I have felt lied to about what the position entails and I am treated like crap by the employees.

On-boarding (i.e. the ramp-up period) is 30 days and at most other non-profit agencies that period of time is 90 days.  The 30 day model leaves insufficient time for clinicians to properly learn the essentials of the job.  The pay structure has changed significantly and thus a clinician is not paid nearly what a clinician's position is worth (that's the case anywhere though, however it's far worse here).  Some, not all, of the supervisors lack the necessary competence in clinical supervision.  The Devereux EHR is very complex.  Most of the focus has shifted to billing and production as opposed to actual client care.  This emphasis on billing has lead to some ethically murky billing situations (i.e. billing for voicemails and/or staffing that may not be clinically necessary).  Supervisors sometimes assign referrals to clinicians who lack the necessary training to be effective with certain clients and thus force some practitioners to practice beyond their scope, which is a real problem."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Licensing Specailist", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2017", "job_title": "Licensing Specialist in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work schedule.

Management will request you to be in two places at once. There are deadlines for things that are nearly impossible to meet because you have so much going on. This job is for people straight out of college seeking case management experience, someone who REALLY needs a job and has no other options, or for someone who can manage their time exceptionally and take advantage of the flexible schedule."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Direct care provider", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Direct Care Professional in Westminster, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great programs for the kids and great school.

They do pay mileage (they claim the mileage rate covers both gas and wear and tear expenses). I'm not sure what idiot was calcuating this formula because their reimbursement rate didn't even cover the gas you used to travel to homes and appointments. In 2013 the IRS national mileage rate was $0.56 per mile. I left Devereux in 2013 and their mileage rate was $0.35, and they refused to raise it when the gas prices would go sky high in the summer. Come on now- we are social workers-  we don't make the big bucks.

If you were reaching 50 minutes you were forced to hang up the on-call phone (even if you were dealing with a crisis) so you could call the on-call supervisor to let them know you had 5 minutes left before you hit 40 hours. They would either give you permission to continue or they would take over because paying any overtime was a big NO NO. Also, when I was out on my vacation time- I was still on-call- so messed up.\r\n\r\nDevereux likes to schmooozeeee- they think they have this reputation of being the \"highest quality\" foster care agency- but nobody really cares or pays attention- as long as you have a home with a bed DCF will think you are fantastic. \r\n\r\nDocumentation- I get it, when you are a social worker you have no other choice, but Devereux documentation standards took it to another level- when documenting a home visit they wanted to know every minor detail from a new pet goldfish in the home to the color of the clothing everyone was wearing when you went to the home- the documentation requirements took away from the clinical treatment you could actually be doing with the clients."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Residential counselor 1", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Residential Counselor I in Red Hook, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The kids are great !
