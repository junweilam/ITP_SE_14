As a patient, I received excellent care from the physicians and the staff.  There are many dedicated, hardworking staff at the DMC.", "cons": "Since TENET took over, I see a decline in the quality of care because of the staffing cuts.  There is a disrespect in the way staff are treated by TENET.  I have seen management who have dedicated many years of their lives to the DMC be walked out by security because they were no longer needed.  There is a lack of honour and respect for those people who gave years of sweat and blood to make the DMC what it is today.  It hurts me to see this.  Another problem is the cuts in staffing.  I realize that there are financial concerns and I don't know what their budget is.  Health care is costly to pay staff and for the supplies needed to run a hospital.  Cutting costs is a reality, but at the same time, patients deserve excellent care.  It is difficult to make hourly rounds when I have 6 couplets on postpartum.  This is 12 patients to care for and chart on.  I can't do it anymore.  I feel like I am running in circles just to barely get the job done.  To me it is not just a job.  It is a vocation which involves interaction and care of patients....not running from room to room spending very minimal time with each person.  If there is an emergency with a patient then it is awful because no other patients can receive excellent care if you are tied up.  The cuts in clerks make it impossible to be with the patients, chart, and answer phones and call lights.  The desk is chaotic.  Also, when an employee is off on medical leave, we have limited income, yet we receive this bill to pay for the medical care and if it is not paid we are cut off of medical care when we need a physician most.  I see people undergoing chemotherapy and all sorts of health problems coming back to work early, while they are still not well, so they don't lose their medical care.  It is awful that staff who dedicate their life to the hospital are treated this way.  I don't want to be an RN anymore because I find it too stressful the way health care is changing to cut costs at the expense of the patients and the staff.  I don't like the way my fellow coworker's in management were treated after years of service.  They are not just numbers, they are people who dedicated their lives to make the hospital what it is today.  I am leaving and retiring early  to enjoy the rest of my life.  I had a great career and I wish everyone the best in their career.
