This provides considerable comfort with ICU medicine even within the 2nd year of residency. There is a significant amount of autonomy on nights, but full support from intensivists and hospitalists is always a call/text/page away. Most impressive aspect of the program are the attendings, whether hospitalists, intensivists, outpatient, or specialty rotations, it is clear that Legacy has made an effort to craft a highly supportive, academic, and non-intimidating envirnment. I am currently an R3, and every year the program makes great strides to decrease burnout and ensure a healthy work-life balance. Residents with less experience, less knowledge, or struggling compared to their cohort are not reprimanded or made to feel small but rather given extra attention and scheduling modifications to catch them up.

When faced with organizational issues, Legacy too often takes a \"try to make everybody happy\" approach, rather than making smart business decisions.\r\n4.) Poor HR policies that, again, strive to be \"fair,\" rather than rewarding excellence. So Instead of \"pay for performance, Legacy claims to extend \"the same\" percentage pay raise to all employees, except this is not true: everybody gets the same percentage raise, based on the midpoint of their position''s pay range. This means if you were hired near the top of your pay range (due to good qualifications), you actually receive a lesser raise than those whose pay is at the lower end.
