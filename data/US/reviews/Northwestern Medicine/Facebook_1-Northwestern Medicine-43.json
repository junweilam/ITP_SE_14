They cry poor and claim that \"[they're] a nonprofit\" whenever you ask for a raise or market adjustment.

They heavily milk their current (but possibly not future) \"#1 in Chicago and top 10 in the country\" status to gaslight employees who raise complaints or make suggestions and expect employees to feel grateful for the \"opportunity\" and \"privilege\" to work there. They do not appreciate employees; everyone is replaceable and viewed just as a number. Even when we log into the systems, we are \"nm\" followed by a series of numbers. They do not care that employees are leaving in droves because they hate it there and management treats them like trash. The leadership from the directors on up is toxic. Tons of in-fighting and complete lack of focus and vision. Please do not work here. You deserve so much better. Rush, UChicago, and UI Health all treat their employees with respect and it shows in their salaries, benefits, and overall attitude.

Staffing, cleaning, resources/items provided for pts and basic necessities for staff to compete tasks). \r\n\r\nInstead of compensating fulltime staff more with a long teased pay increase mention, slapped us with 1% increase, less than or equal to 50\u00a2 \"promotion\", while watching loyal staff quit in droves to be replaced by even more 3x hourly staff rates, and or floating staff who have now consistently been responsible for growing pt deaths. Staff are required to work every other weekends and expected to take min 6 pts/precept/train without incentive or notification.Expectations are to do nursing/CNA/wound care/ and PT ueless contract staffing that often illegally document care, and at times are abusive. \r\nRooms, equipment, anything reusable is never cleaned appropriately or even at all (i.e. pt rooms often are \"mopped\" down with the same liquid that's been used by the last however many shifts, leaving gross smells and weird residual smearing, ignoring dangerous can accumulate on your furniture) none of the equipment works. If you find a rolling computer that will turn on, open epic, has a functional scanner, it probably will either randomly shutdown or can't connect to our internet when moved, especially more than 10 feet (or too quickly/accidental bump/try to plug in to charge). We've recently had some upgrades I guess for our garbage outdated IV Alaris pump equipment. They've places new colored stickers on them, still same charge/connection/function issues, but hey, there a new colored sticker? Our old phones were absolute trash, old school brick nokea, now have become a new wave soft edge nokea that worked very well for 2-3 months? To be fair, our phone reception connection doesn't disconnect or search for service mid call anymore, instead just won't allow you to hear the caller or speak to them, usually one or the other. Majority also have damage with microphone/speaker from what believe is caused by frequency of sanitization. The expenses northwest pays for epic access should make them ashamed enough to know that there's no efficient way to communicate with the healthcare team. There are plenty of ways to communicate with the healthcare team through epic, even implementing viscera communication devices, honestly smoke signals are seemly Better options for healthcare team communication. Northwestern apparently doesn't care that everyone other than doctors he has to waste hours of their life calling answer services over and over again, listening to the same 12 minute recording about hours of operation to even get to the beginning of the number selection to only \"leave a message or page\" for the Dr that 94% of the time will never call back until it's escalated to death certificate. It's hands up best situations when the doctor forces to me confidence that of course we need to call and the consults verbally insult us for calling and refuse to take the patient/or when looking for discharge papers all the drs go back and forth blaming each other needing auth from the other, refusing to call themselves even though they obviously have each other's direct lines and us peeons are only allowed to play phone tag while keeping pts stable/trying to prevent being kicked in the face AGAIN, Drs lie to pts about leaving or make promises without followup always. Pts complain, and it's your fault. Have spent too many hrs of reporting concerns/inappropriate hcp access, literally documenting how attendings we're notified hrs , days sometimes weeks about how the pt they're caring for on call is actively dying and they're allowing it due to irresponsibly. Complaints about the absolute lack of physician communications is aonly applicable during the shift operator managers hrs that day. Often it's better/quicker to request a different physician team for critical pt situations. It's disgusting and absolutely unacceptable , especially that clinicians are allowed to consult the same unavailable groups of physicians, causing more concern, should not be allowed .\r\nWe have zero equipment. No wound care equipment foams, (zero ostomy equipment as opposed to our almost nothing stock), no dietary basics like spoons, applesauce, anything diabetic friendly, bedside equipment, cares and comfort/safety- contact gowns, fitted sheets, blankets, pt gowns, viable gloves. How disgusting is it to gown up in something supposed to be sanitized and protect you that has wet sleeves and sticky residual adhesive throughout. How about when you're told you have a serious contact droplet pt but don't have a fit mask or eye protection. Embarrassingly have to bring multiple sheets/blankets general bedding to pts bc all the first ones have disgusting things still attached or stained.\r\n\r\nI've been waiting for northwestern to make things better and honestly things have only gotten more difficult,more frustrating, forcing out good employees that should be a priority for retention. Need experienced staff to train new hires, since management is absolutely clueless rt pt care. Nurse manager and nursing educator walked off understaffed floor bc of feeling uncomfortable/unknowledgeable, especially after educator accidentally drew up letal doses of insulin after giving the team a presentation rt insulin and it's importance in diabetics. \r\n\r\nI wish I could make this up."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "tech", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Immediate Care Technician in Aurora, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good hours. 3 shifts a week for full time", "cons": "hourly pay and not salary"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Resident", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Feb 2022", "job_title": "PGY1 Pharmacy Resident in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "supportive team, resources, good salary, workflow smooth,", "cons": "Overworked and unorganized at times"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great patient care\r\nAbove Standard care", "cons": "At this moment no cons to discuss"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Pretty Okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Unit Secretary in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, pay, and opportunities for growth.", "cons": "Lots of racism in the hospital."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Mental Health", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Safety Companion in DeKalb, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I am still employed for now.", "cons": "I have mental health disabilities and I have been open and honest with them, and I have worked there for over a year.
