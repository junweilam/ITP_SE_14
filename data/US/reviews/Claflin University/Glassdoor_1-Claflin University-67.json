The morale is very low here and most of us are fearful to speak our true feelings since the university fires employees summarily and cancels the insurance right afterwards.  It reminds me of an old slave plantation ran by well-paid overseers [administrators earning between $120-350,000/year] while the overworked lower staff and professors earn between $15,000-50,000 a year.  I knew several faculty members who were on more than eight committees while teaching a heavy load.  The research done is only what the college finds for you to do because there is no time to pursue your own scholarship freely.  This is not run like a traditional college and my advice is:  DO NOT COME HERE if you want a good salary, to do research, and want to feel respected.  I cannot wait to leave like so many others have left over the last 5 years.  Its endowment of $26 million dollars is a far cry from the internet lie that it is over $100 million.  Horrible place to work!!  Because the students are mostly underprepared and not college ready, the level of the quality of classroom teaching is very low in order to ensure the students pass the course.  Because of this, graduates are not adequately trained to succeed in graduate, law, or other professional schools or simply cannot pass the basic teaching exams to get certified.

The only reason I rated this place a one star is because you cannot go any lower than that. Most of the upper level \"management\", if you can call them that, have a ridiculous air of pomposity about them that makes me sick to my stomach. They are disrespectful to the employees and pass their work off on them only to make employees feel overworked and underpaid. It is impossible to ever advance here, especially if you are one to challenge the status quo, which is funny because as an alumni of the university my professors basically beat that concept into my head. Furthermore, I would NEVER recommend anyone to even fill out an application to this wretched place. Every morning I wake up, I dread getting out of bed because I'm going to a place where no one cares about you or your well being and they'd rather you die in a position than to give you time to ensure you are mentally, physically, and emotionally stable. Also, since I've been here I have not been trained nor have I received a formal job description/description of  duties. You will be asked for new, fresh and exciting ideas, however, when presented, your ideas will be shot down quicker than a US jet in a Russian militarized airspace. All in all, this experience has allowed me the opportunity to really understand why black people do not advance as a people. We are too worried about looks and not focused on the task at hand. Claflin University is the epitome of that; focused on a beautiful facade, instead of advancing their students and employees so that they may compete in a more globalized world. 'Tis true, \"The World Needs Visionaries\", but how can they come from Claflin when neglect is at an all time high and morale is at an all time low?

Faculty members are silent because they are scared of what would happen to them if they voiced their opinion. \r\n\r\nThere is no faculty senate, of course. Faculty is expected to teach, then shut up and go home, leaving the \u201creal job\u201d to the highly-paid top management. Management is old-style - not to say backward - in its mentality. Nepotism is rampant (everybody knows about it, but nobody dares mention that issue). Some of the buildings, including the building of communication and business, are filthy: mouse and roach infestation, and bathrooms smelling like toilets in a truckers\u2019 highway rest area. Collegiality is non-existent, everybody being too scared of what would happen if they were going to confide to a colleague spilling the beans. \r\n\r\nI have taught at seven different universities, including open-enrolment ones, and I have never witnessed such a low academic level among the students. No discipline, no motivation, no respect for the professors. Most professors do not react to this state of affair, because they know they will be let go if evals are not high enough. There is a constant pressure from top management to inflate the final grades (e.g., on one of the forms every prof has to complete at the end of each semester, the following question must be answered: \u201cWhat do you plan to do in the next semester to improves overall grades?\u201d). Most of the students are not college-ready (not even high school-ready, for at least half of them). Still, they are admitted (and receive a degree they do not deserve) because this private university needs to keep on enrolling to financially survive. The MBA program is a joke, with most graduates ending up in a secretarial position at best. \r\n\r\nUniversities are known for how bureaucratic they can be, but this institution beats all the others I have known when it comes to red tape \u2013 most likely because top management does not trust the faculty: at the end of every semester, each faculty member must complete a dossier that includes ALL of the PowerPoint slides used during the semester in the various courses, as well as all the exams, quizzes, etc. Faculty members are not allowed to communicate with their students via university emails: they must communicate via Moodle, so that top management can monitor all communications. Worst of all perhaps, racism is rampant, on both sides: non-black complain (very discreetly) that this institution is disorganized because it is led by black folks, whereas top management (all blacks) would not even consider having a non-black in a top position. This place is financially surviving only because it is a HBCU, and a failing HBCU would be bad rep for the state of South Carolina. Still, in the coming years this place will have to either shut its door, or be swallowed by the SCSU campus next door, given its low financial endowment and its overall financial woes.\r\n\r\nIn short, only desperate faculty members should apply at this university, and when doing so they should plan for a backup plan in case things go sour: this institution has a reputation for letting faculty go with no notice whatsoever. And South Carolina is an \u201cat will\u201d state\u2026 Good luck if you end up there, you will need it."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Low Salaries and Low Standards for Academics and Conduct", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Orangeburg, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There were no \"pros\" other than just having a paycheck.", "cons": "Expect to be underpaid by about $20,000 per year, regardless of education level or experience. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are a small number of legitimate honor students who have scholarships, about 90% of my students either lacked the intellectual ability suitable for college or were simply too lazy and undisciplined to take classes seriously and to complete the coursework. \r\n\r\nYet, administrators pressure faculty to pass every student, even those who have been uncooperative and have not completed the work. The do not want faculty to give students Ds--not even \"mercy Ds\" for students who numerically should have received Fs.\r\n\r\nThe university places the spotlight on the few academically strong students and on faculty grants and research to draw attention away from the fact that the school makes its money by serving as a degree mill that will accept almost any applicant and refuses to provide the programs that underprepared students need in order to catch up. \r\n\r\nThey claim to pride themselves in taking students where they are upon admission, but the problem is that there is no incentive for students to improve and acquire the skills they need.
