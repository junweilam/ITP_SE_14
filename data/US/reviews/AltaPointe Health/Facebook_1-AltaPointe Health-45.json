After a year, I (along with several others in our building) began approaching management about unethical behavior in our facility. This all centered around the director of our building. This director had meetings with us where she would attempt to pressure us to commit fraud. She would tell us that we HAD to have a certain amount of billing each month, regardless of the number of individuals currently in the program and regardless of whether or not the services were warranted. She would regularly pressure us to provide services that were not medically necessary for the clients. She would tell us that we had to overbill the contract so we could get a larger contract next year. This same director would regularly treat clients as if they were her lab mice. When the psychiatrist would meet with clients, she would sit in on the evaluations, and act as if she was the doctor. She would even tell the psychiatrist what she should prescribe. The director would also meet with these clients individually also, when they already had a therapist in the program. She would regularly sit in group therapy, to intentionally gather information about drug use that would many times trigger others in group. Many women would have to leave group because she was triggering them so badly. She was well aware of this, but would still continue the discussion. It was also brought to management's attention that there was a therapist in our building who was having a romantic relationship with a former client in the program (whom she had counseled within the last six months). It was then discovered that the therapist and the client were actually living together. Management did nothing about this situation, or the numerous situations with the director of our facility. I took the matter all the way up the chain of command (to the very top), but senior management did nothing. They pretended they were on my side for months and then began retaliating against me, through write-ups and threats. They completely changed my job description to require field work for 80% of my day, when they knew I wouldn't be able to account for it in the way of billing, due to the lack of women in our program. I filed an EEOC complaint for their retaliation, and they only became more aggressive in their attempts to get rid of me. I eventually resigned, due to the lack of leadership, the lack of moral compass, and the unethical practices at AltaPointe. Immediately after resigning, I filed for unemployment. AltaPointe attempted to fight the case, but after a two-day hearing, the judge awarded me unemployment, and even awarded me back pay. I could have filed a lawsuit against the company with the amount of evidence that I had, but I chose the quickest end possible. I was emotionally and physically drained after months of fighting for ethical change. The judge had some harsh words for AltaPointe in my award letter, and I can only hope they have made changes since then."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Learned a lot but management sure doesn't", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Mental Health Therapist in Mobile, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure to the mental health realities of the world but in the southern US there is a 'disability' culture like nowhere else", "cons": "Abysmal pay, expectation of billing 8 hours per day when it is impossible, lousy benefits, worst CEO ever had the displeasure of meeting(scheslinger, AKA Sleezinger), and just more and more cutting with the worst burnout rate imaginable."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Coordinator", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 May 2016", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Mobile, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "AltaPointe Health Systems is a great place to work.
