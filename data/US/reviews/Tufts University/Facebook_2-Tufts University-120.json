Admissions staff of Color leaving in droves, Student Life sweeping reports of misogyny under the rug to keep business moving. Student services staff stretched thin. Faculty abusive to staff. DEI workshops/meetings/guest lectures and \u201ccommunity dialogues\u201d are for show. Reports to OEO are \u201cinconclusive\u201d and staff are gaslit. Toxic place to work.
