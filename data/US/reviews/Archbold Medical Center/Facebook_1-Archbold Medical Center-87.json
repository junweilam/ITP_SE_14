My fellow coworkers share my passion and desire to care for every patient as if they are our family members. This is extremely important to me. Though some may perceive being \"nice\", \"compassionate\" and \"caring\" as basic and not immensely important, I strongly disagree. This is the very foundation of the work that we do. If a clinician, or any other employee who interacts with patients, does not possess this sincere desire to help others, the patient will not receive good care and it can even adversely effect the patient's outcome. Once that genuine foundation of caring and compassion is well-established and nurtured (every morning prior to work, I pray for all of our patients and ask God to guide my hands, heart, and mind to do the right thing for each and every one of them), then clinical knowledge and experience is built to ensure that each patient is receiving evidence-based care in accordance with the latest guidelines for care and latest research. We never stop caring for the patients, and we never stop learning. This is the Archbold way, and I am exceptionally proud to be a part of such a fine organization. I have had patients come to us who live 50+ miles from Archbold, but they state that the excellent care and loving staff is worth the drive! Though I have had many job offers from Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, Emory, and Shands, I plan to stay at Archbold, as I truly feel that the care we provide is on par with these fine, academic institutions. I have been a part of Archbold's growth for 25 years now, and it has been spectacular. The commitment from the organization as a whole to grow and become even better than we were yesterday continues, and I look forward to growing right along with the organization until retirement! While working at Archbold, I worked throughout college as I obtained my Batchelor's, Master's, and Doctorate degrees! Archbold supported me 100% as I pursued higher education to provide the best care possible to my patients. I must also add that I was recently diagnosed with a serious, chronic health problem that necessitated I transfer to a new position for the protection of my health. Archbold immediately worked with me, found a perfect fit for me, went above and beyond to accommodate me and find a position that utilizes my talents, benefits the organization, and keeps me safe! You just cannot find a better employer than Archbold!", "cons": "In my many years at Archbold, I have noticed that communication between administration and clinicians is somewhat lacking (and sadly, completely lacking at times in the past).
