Pay - Even with two members of my household as \"Valued\" employees, we can barely afford rent. We are barely over the limit to qualify for food stamps and, even with public assistance via WIC, we're seeing travelling employees coming in and getting paid almost double for those of us who are serving this community because it is OUR community Lack of training - not uncommon to be thrown on the floor during orientation due to lack of staff and patient ratios resulting in life-threatening mistakes for the patient Managerial Delusions of Grandeur - Touting things like \"Munson is in the top 100 for teaching schools\" Honestly, if Munson is a teaching school, I fear for those who need healthcare in the future. Staff is stretched too thin to even get all their daily tasks and care done let alone train someone else how to do it properly. Lack of Care for the Community - By continuing these unfair and UNSAFE labor practices, Munson Management is putting the community in danger - people can't receive the care that they deserve or need because Munson can't keep people on - it's not worth it for the pay and the mental anguish that employees are facing to continue to undervalue and underpay those who are directly caring for the members of the community MMC management is more concerned with putting lipstick on the pig that is Munson Healthcare. MMC has monopolized healthcare in northern Michigan and the employees and the communities are paying the price. Poor allocation/mismanagement of funds - Adding new OR suites that can't even take on additional patients due to lack of staff instead of paying people a living wage, adding new computers and big screen TVs to \"assist\" as opposed to figuring out a solution to the inability to actually retain people who can assist with the patients physical needs. I'd like to see how a television can help a surgical patient get out of bed to use the bathroom or go for a walk or bathe."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not worth the pay", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 May 2023", "job_title": "Patient Sitter in Grayling, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can't think of any pros", "cons": "The hours were inconsistent, the pay nor as promised"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Respiratory", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Registered Respiratory Therapist in Traverse City, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay and Benefits are above average.", "cons": "Did not seem to be much room for advancement"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Don't work here if you have other options", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Traverse City, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Annual holiday party is good", "cons": "Low pay in comparison to others in same field both state wide and national.

In other words you could be a dedicated hard-working loyal employee what if your manager does not like you she will write you up for things that others do on a daily basis it's a disgrace and a shame and should not be tolerated.  MMC simply hides behind their policies and claims all of their managers have integrity and dignity? \r\n If you work for any Munson healthcare agency do not speak up the matter how much they encourage you to do so! Ultimately it comes down to the manager you work for and to put blinders on and pretend  that all managers treat employees with dignity and respect is just foolish. \r\n The bottom line is you have no recourse a manager can accuse you of anything and I mean anything based on nothing more than what they heard and you will be written up.
