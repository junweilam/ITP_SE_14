What bothers me is not the person behind the review, but the \"management styles\"  that seem to exist within the company.  In an understanding that there are many bad apples out there that will try to sabotage a company, a majority of the negative reviews I saw, could have been prevented. These negative reviews indicate that the supervisor doesn't seem to understand that you are not supposed to \"manage\" your employees.  You are supposed to lead.  \r\n \r\nIn my job quest, I turned down many offers and have tried to endure the impossible in negative work environments.  However, when I stepped foot into this facility for my interview, I knew there was something different about it. \r\n\r\nSocial services can be a very tough field to endure. In order to take care of people, we need to be taken care of as well. This location does a very GOOD job at doing this. Here, a supervisor is considered a leader, and the employees are considered a TEAM!  \r\n\r\nA typical day of work: Often, my leader has gone from door to door, interacting with us and making sure that we are OKAY!  This is the most positive experience I have dealt with in working in social services and I hope that absolutely nothing gets in the way of me continuing employment here.\r\n\r\nI have had plenty of time to TRAIN! Training is so important to me, as I've found that many jobs have thrown tasks at me that I have found difficult due to lack of training.  Each day, I feel more and more comfortable with the work I will be doing here in the future.  There is multiple opportunities to grow and develop.  The most enjoyable part of the job has been my coworkers and the population I am serving.  \r\n\r\nEven better, the team is always looking out for me, and I feel the same way about them!  In other organizations, asking questions and receiving annoyed looks was usually already a downer for me, and indication that the work environment was going to be hostile.  Every day, someone at this place is always at my door, giving me some helpful information or resources.\r\n\r\nOverall, organizations have to really watch out who they are hiring as leaders. Those leaders need to understand that times will be tough working in social services positions, but what will add to that stress is a lack of self-care, self-awareness, empathy, and allowing the negative energies of others to transfer in their daily conversations and actions in their organization.\r\n\r\nI would love to say more, about how great the leadership is here, but I know I could go on and on about it...
