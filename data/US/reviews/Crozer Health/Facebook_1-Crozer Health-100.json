Point: little to no help given when needed. See more patients but don't expect more resources to help you do your job. Travel 15 miles to one office 1 day, 10 to another office the next 2 days, finish out the week back 15 miles away and they don't pay you for travel. You have to pay to park at the hospitals except 1 even if you work there and Crozer Chester is about $30 monthly. RIP OFF! \r\n\r\nManagement is mostly concerned with losing the jobs they aren't qualified for (my manager has no qualifications, and it reflects in the office), and they don't care who they step on or ruin in the process of keeping their job. There was constant change in infrastructure and at one point we did not have a department head for almost a year, which makes using the chain of command for office problems impossible. SO many employees on FMLA for one reason or another (maybe lack of help and resources? think about it....) and FAR too many PERSONAL politics for a medical office that your work environment will become hostile. Favoritism is rampant and not just among the physicians. One of my co-workers comes to work high on prescription anxiety medication, nodding out, falling asleep at her desk, and despite multiple complaints from 4 or 5 people in the office INCLUDING 2 of the doctors, she is still employed. They are cover-up artists at CKHN, from clinical supervisor all the way up to administrative director. The things they allow in this organization...... it's really opened up my eyes to how big business works. The almighty dollar truly rules. \r\n\r\nThe health benefits are good, they even cover IVF. Not usually any out of pocket for surgery or maternity care and you get access to the Healthplex gym at a discount albeit not a great one. You do have to use all CK physicians to get the most out of your benefits and you have to be careful if you need access to a specialist they don't have. There are a lot of changes happening within the network and Crozer was recently bought and have been attending many meetings, training and classes. \r\n\r\nCKHS facilities are \"community-based\" which means patients can treat you however they want and your providers will not dismiss them: the $3 they're getting from Keystone First is much more important than you bursting into tears at work. There is a lot of pressure to invoke your collections capabilities and they keep seeing these patients while their balances grow and grow. Pay is awfully low for any non-union position but then again I heard the nurses complaining about as much as the MA's. It doesn't matter how much experience you have when you first join Crozer because they will start you at an almost insulting rate of pay. However, when you need a job and it is offered, there is no question whether or not you will take the position. There was a raise in the past year, but for many years straight there was not. I know for a fact that I'm making close to what other employees who have been around 10-plus years are making. \r\n\r\nThe doctors, where do I begin? Some of them are fantastic. I mean truly great individuals and physicians. Some are terrible people but great doctors. A few are crap all around.  I got lucky with good ones for the most part but have encountered mean people here."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Management and Maintenance are Lacking", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Springfield, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No micromanagement.

Management seems clueless as to what it takes to get the job done ,not enough employees to get things done properly, many people have already left because things are so bad and they are not replaced but they still expect all the work to be done with fewer and fewer people ,they use fear , intimidation, threats and bullying to get things  done. That a job gets done is more important than it's quality. A lot of the equipment is ancient and broken, The State and other inspectors need to just show up without warning to see what really goes on."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "If I could give it a zero,  I would", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Chester, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "NONE, ZERO, ZILCH, NADA, NOTHING", "cons": "They treat longtime, loyal employees like dirt.
