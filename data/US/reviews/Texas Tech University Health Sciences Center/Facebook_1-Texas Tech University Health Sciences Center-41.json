Very low stress environment. (There is not much of a rush to do anything, very chill place)\r\n2. Co-workers and other department's personnel are very nice and polite. (People you interact with will treat you kindly)\r\n3. Decent benefits. Lots of time off. (Great work/life balance)\r\n4. Immediate supervisor at the Abilene campus is great, takes care of employees, and is totally worth working for! (One of the best parts of the job)\r\n5. Business casual dress code. (Relaxed dress: Pants and collared shirt)\r\n6. Work place cultural values are pretty nice here. \r\n7. Hour long lunch break and you can pick the time you take it. (Within reason of course)\r\n8. Not a much travel. (You will be home just about every night)\r\n9. Work parties and holidays are nice here! People around here can cook! (LOL)\r\n\r\nSummary of Pros:\r\nThe best part of the Safety Officer Job at Texas Tech Abilene, is the feeling of being part of a family work culture. There are lots of good people to be friends with here. I would recommend this job for someone who wants a chill place and has no plans to advance, basically a great place to retire and work.", "cons": "1. Safety Services senior management is uncaring. \r\n2. Senior Management will hire from the outside, before they hire or promote from within, despite what they tell you. (BEWARE: Don't expect to advance within the Safety Service dept., there is rarely an opening, same goes for all the other depts.)\r\n3. Senior management gives very little communication and direction, they are happy to ignore you for the most part. (Until there's a problem. You're pretty much on your own every day. You will need to find something to do every day)\r\n4. With no directions, the work days feel very long. (Everyday drags on)\r\n5. Senior management is difficult to reach when you have an issue. (Replies take a long time. Days to even weeks.)\r\n6. Advancement opportunities are very rare, there is just nowhere to go. (If you are young (below 30) and want to advance your career, Safety Services Dept. is unlikely to help you much)\r\n7. Pay is really low. One of the lowest paying safety jobs in Texas and I got the max the senior management budgeted it for. (BEWARE: It\u2019s just enough to scrape by on, very small raises, if any at all. I got one .29 cent raise in 2 years)\r\n8. You will be the Safety Officer for both Abilene and Dallas campuses. No extra pay and next to no possibility of overtime (Emergency overtime pay only, we never had an emergency in 2 years).\r\n9. Nothing ever happens fast, lots and lots of frustrating bureaucracy and internal politics. (Stuff takes weeks to months to happen. Welcome to a state job)\r\n10. Pay to park on campus. It is optional, and as of 2020 it's $14 a month to park on campus. (Not worth it, you're basically just paying, so Security can eventually ticket you for a mistake and they check the parking lots everyday)\r\n11. You will deal with hazardous waste (bio and chem) nearly every single day. Exposure is very possible. (Lab personnel are not great at packing it up correctly, always check it before accepting it)\r\n12. No official job specific training. (The Safety Manuals, university policies, and the university wide generic online safety trainings is pretty much all you get. Lots of dry reading and you better know it!)\r\n13. Nearly all equipment is either a hand-me down, so old its obsolete, or its missing parts. (Safety dept. is actually working on fixing this, slowly, but surly)\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Cons: \r\nThe worst parts of the Safety Officer Job at Texas Tech Abilene, are the senior management's lack of caring/communication and no advancement. If things continue this way, as they did for me over the course of 2 years, you will be left alone every day to figure out what in the world you're supposed to be doing nearly every day. I would recommend using this place as a stepping stone while looking for something better to do."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "TTUHSC is a great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Managing Director in Lubbock, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture, benefits and being part of a great team.", "cons": "Some might believe living in Lubbock is a con.
