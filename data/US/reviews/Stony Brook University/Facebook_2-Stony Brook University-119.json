In my 6 years there, I worked in 4 different offices. 3 of them had no windows, and all of them had temperature control issues - either too hot or too cold. Most of the problems couldn't be fixed when I  or others complained about it - it was just 'how it was'. The Union building had to be shut down because it's in critical condition. They can't afford to clean faculty and grad student offices more than once a year. The desk I had was falling apart. The WifI in the library sucked. There were no outlets to plug my laptop in at the library. The roof used to leak a lot. The stairwells would flood when it rained, and the list goes on.. \r\n\r\n-- The culture [both internal to Stony Brook and endemic to Long Island] is toxic. Very few people are happy there - whether it be undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, or staff. The only people I met who seemed to be happy are administrators (who are paid exorbent salaries to basically pontificate all day about how great and honorable the University is, while doing very little tangible work), and some of the super star faculty, who are given perks and cushy salaries to keep them there. The school was ranked in the top 10 least happy campuses by Princeton Review.\r\n\r\n-- Long Island sucks for graduate students any young people (and in general). Long Island is a terrible place to live - extremely high rent, nasty, rude locals, constant and terrible traffic at all times of day, and a lack of sense of community. You are hardpressed to find local culture, it's mostly all mindless dull suburbian sprawl extending in all directions. \r\n\r\n-- Housing situation is terrible for Ph.D. students. Grad students are forced to live in crowded, poorly maintained houses (some with 6-12 people) and pay $700-$1000 a month just for a room. Apartments in the region are only affordable to Ph.D. students with big loans or trust funds.
