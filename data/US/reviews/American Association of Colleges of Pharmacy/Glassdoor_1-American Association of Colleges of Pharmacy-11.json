But it\u2019s a good org overall. Just needs to settle back down. A lot of the employees who have been around for a long time don\u2019t love the new CEO. He is very different from the previous CEO, but he\u2019s not necessarily a bad leader or even person. He just might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Who your manager is will contribute a lot to your experience. Work-life balance tends to be pretty good in most departments with pressures to work nonstop mostly being a mentality some old school individuals have but not necessarily something they expect from everyone else. Excellent benefits and PTO allotment. Generous parking or public transit arrangements offered for those who commute to the office. Very flexible hybrid work environment with a newer policy that allows managers to determine how often their direct reports need to work from the office. If you get a good manager, you can typically work from home as often as makes sense for you and your work responsibilities. No going into the office simply to check a box. Professional development funding is also available and makes it a good place to grow your career even if your specific position doesn\u2019t have a ton of upward mobility. There have been efforts to implement in person all staff gatherings a few times a year, which has been good for getting to know other staff better and fostering open forum discussions with management. Needs more structure, but they have the right idea. With every company there will be some people who are simply not pleasant to work with, and AACP definitely has some of those. But overall, it\u2019s a good place to work that has a lot of great employees and very nice members who really believe in their heartfelt mission to support and improve pharmacy education across the US.", "cons": "It\u2019s a small organization\u2014only about 35 employees\u2014 which can be both good and bad. If you have never worked at such a small org, there might be some culture shock for you. It\u2019s very different than working at a large company. CEO can sometimes react from a place of heightened emotions. He will generally listen to reason once his emotions have calmed a bit though."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Terrible CEO", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Director in Crystal City, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most of the people who work at AACP are wonderful, smart, and driven individuals.
