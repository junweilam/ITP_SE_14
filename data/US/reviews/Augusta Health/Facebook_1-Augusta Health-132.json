Those same labs cost $200 when I worked with Augusta and they offer no employee discounts at their facilities. Sentara accrues vacation time based on how much you work. Augusta is a fixed rate and you get an additional day after 5 years with the company. Sentara recently also started offering several weeks of parrntal leave as well as offering reimbursement for adoption and fertility expenses. Sentara also pays experience nurses almost $20/hr more base pay for experienced nurses. The benefits and pay need a significant overhaul if they wish to be competitive especially since the hospital brags that it's the only one in the area with no debt. The administration has had several formal complaints of bullying, hostility, and retaliation with no resolution from HR. Only half hearted apologies at best.
