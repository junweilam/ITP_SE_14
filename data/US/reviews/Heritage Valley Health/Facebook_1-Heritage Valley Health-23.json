Weekend nights are especially rough because there\u2019s no swing shift so you frequently walk into 3-4 admissions to start. They pitch the schedule as a plus, but in reality it can be a draw back. My advice would be to request at least 8 days off each month including 2 weekends or you\u2019ll work 3 weekends a month and be used to fill in the holes in the schedule. Lastly, the \u201cproduction bonus\u201d is only given 2 times a year.

Client hardware is ancient, and \"new\" equipment is EOL refurbs, resulting in more expense in repair & man hours than simply using new equipment.\r\n\r\nWhile there are lots of projects and plans for modernization, there is an incredible amount of roadblocks on the way there.  Change is met with extreme skepticism and cynicism.  Basic, non-production changes often take weeks to implement for no good reason.\r\n\r\nThere are about 350 programs and technologies that IT is required to manage, with little to no documentation.  Most of the tickets that get placed, turn into mini-projects because no one knows anything about the systems in place.\r\n\r\nCertain persons (pretty much just doctors and managers) get a ridiculous amount of preference.  I've had key persons pulled from critical meetings that I was running, because a doctor's third laptop's microphone stopped working for dictation.  There's really no scope or boundaries of your job - you'll be sent to people's houses, set up personal email & App Store accounts, and work on personal equipment.  All users are handheld and babied to an absurd degree; IT leaders constantly bow down to the user and throw their employees under the bus.  There is no user training for computers and related equipment, and most of the staff are older and never used computers, so there is a huge technological ineptitude.\r\n\r\nThe IT department is made of technical people and clinical application administrators.  The clinical application administrators are nurses who have been pulled from their field for a pay raise, to work on EHR, RIS, etc. systems.  They have way too much power to shut down and block the actual IT operations that they neither understand nor want to learn about.\r\n\r\nManagement decided several years ago to move all helpdesk and some sysadmins/engineers to a contracting firm.  There is very poor quality control on who comes in, and the pay from the contracting firm is very subpar.  This results in a revolving door, which management explicitly states that they're aiming to prevent.  Because of this, there is no stable, experienced lower-level support.  Management made this decision because they didn't want to manage people anymore - I've seen too many times, horrible people who get negative references, get hired; while good people get fired for the silliest discrepancy.\r\n\r\nManagement in nearly every part of the company is extremely complacent and dug-in.  Nobody even attempts at proper grammar or English via email.  Basic etiquette is ignored.  People jump the chain to the department heads just because they met them at a meet & greet.  Managers are very stuck in their ways, and don't want to listen to fresh, new ideas or opinions.  Many people are only there because they have 30 years of seniority in the company - they're no longer useful or productive.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no training, and very little progression in the IT department.  There are absolutely no employee morale programs or events.\r\n\r\nThe actual IT side of the IT department is very lean - way understaffed.  While all other client-facing departments are overstaffed, the IT personnel are over-worked.  Management tries to play it off during the interview and early stages of employment as \"a high-paced, demanding environment\", but really, people are simply overworked.\r\n\r\nI'm leaving soon, but I wish I didn't have to.
