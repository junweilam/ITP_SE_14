The pay is the lowest I have ever seen in higher education (k-12 teachers get paid more) and the union is extremely weak so don't waste your money. Its an okay start for someone with no teaching experience but its not a place you can make a career. Its a stepping stone to another community college- a REAL community college. The administration is full of men and if you are a person of color watch out because they will make it difficult for you and set you up to fail. The college is run like a for-profit and not a community college. Whatever the Administrator wants goes and don't bother questioning or they will set you up to be fired.
