I was told I would be managing and growing on top of the endocrinology departments after a year I realized that was all lies it was still only me and the physician that worked there after a year though we had full schedules of patience a wait list 6 months long to get in to see us we still did not have any help I was janitor to manager with only a doctor and thousands of patients. Did my patients have the best care yes they did was I on top of all their prior authorizations or the paperwork or their appointments all the reminders all their medications all their education or their trainings yes I was. Did Deborah at all in the administration care no they did not they don't care about the patients and they sure as hell don't give a crap about their staff. they just pile on more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more work while they sit behind a desk clueless and don't help at all. Finally after a year they hired a third administration person just to drive around and gaslight people smile in their face and gaslight them literally did nothing you paid a person to drive around and do nothing instead of hiring people to actually help your staff. After 2 years I was so worn down and my father passed away do you want to know what administration the only people above me my bosses said to me when will you be back to work not sorry about your loss not anything when will you be back to work cuz it can't run without me there's no other staff there's no coverage I can't get sick I can't do anything. Then have the audacity to save even more money and get more bonuses for the administration that does absolutely nothing but sit behind a desk and make bad decisions on how to make more money in their pocket but not how to help staff not how to help patients nothing like that they going to get the cheapest EMR so it's 20 times more paperwork for their staff even more horrible communication between patients they destroyed it and all they did was sit behind their desk and when people said well we're going to need this before it happens this is going to happen before it happens they did nothing they did absolutely nothing and just waited for their staff to cover their butt the day it happens.. and when staff is done and looks at him and says you made these stupid mistakes get off your butt and do it yourself they don't appreciate it so much.. all this for minimum wage the lowest pay you'll get in any area of New Jersey you can go and be a janitor at Wawa and make more money than a manager at the Deborah and if you're a nurse you will be making the lowest pay around good luck.. oh wait there's more if you're looking for insurance this is not the place I broke my tibia and went into financial ruin because of the insurance so now there's really not one perk to this place unless you want to be overworked underpaid underappreciated oh wait your Christmas bonus was a $5 wawa card yay.. don't worry administration got big bonuses..."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "UGH", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Service Attendant in Browns Mills, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "me and my coworkers get along well and try our best to help each other when we can.", "cons": "Pay is low, managers suck and like to belittle you, they will not help you if you ask for help.
