Distraction from Studies:\r\n\r\nWorking along with studies consumes your time. It can distract you from your studies which can lead to many different issues. Working with stress can lead to several health issues too. Like a constant headache and sleeping disorders too.\r\n\r\n2. Increase Stress Level:\r\n\r\n Working along with studies gives you opportunities but on the other hand, it can increase stress level too. There can be days where you have to do overwork, which sometimes doesn\u2019t allow a student to pay attention towards his studies.\r\n\r\n3. Lack of Concentration:\r\n\r\n Taking in every perspective of working along there can be chances where you have deadlines and exams at the same time. Might be you\u2019ll pay attention to studies but then your works piles up, which is a bit unprofessional.\r\n\r\n4. No Time for Other Activities:\r\n\r\nMaintaining studies and working along is a bit hard but it can be balanced. These two activities consume more of your time when you are not studying you are doing office work. When you are doing office work you aren\u2019t studying. These two will consume much of your work which means you will not be having time for other activities. You won\u2019t be having time for family and friends.\r\n\r\n5. Can Lead To Bad Grades\r\n\r\n It needs your time, which affects your main aim of life i.e. studies. It does hamper your studies, it does affect your grades. Might be you don\u2019t find time for studies and this can affect your working too. You may have mood swings for not paying attention to both.\r\n\r\nStudying and working, both are two different phases of life. Handling them that too at the same time obviously require more energy and dedication. Studies are important in a student life but experiencing work culture along with it can be a blessing. It improves your knowledge. But balancing it along studies is a bit difficult because a small mistake can change a lot. Workings in the age where you are still a student have advantages and disadvantages. It\u2019s how you handle it."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Excelent way to comprehend electrical engineering", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Beaumont, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "He is flexible, time isn't waisted and is informative to us the students.
