The college has a strange knack for backing into excellent young supervisors who have extraordinarily high upside and bring on great people with them. \r\n\r\nMost of campus is very helpful towards each other. You'll rarely get blowback from people when you ask for help and assistance. Depending on the department, it can feel like an incredibly empowering place to work. I was fortunate to be a work hard/play hard office at the college and the team I was with was one of the best i've ever worked with. \r\n\r\nThe alumni and students are quirky and certainly non-traditional, so don't expect a very stuffed up, typically academic experience. People are friendly, the campus is gorgeous and in spite of its challenges, can be a great place to work.", "cons": "Nearly all of the good things I said above are in spite of upper management; who at this point are a real detriment to the school's ability to move forward. While the school inadvertently finds young managers with talent, they do next to nothing to take care of them, utterly take them for granted and at times actively attempt to credential them into oblivion and ensure they *don't* get promoted. To be honest, it's pretty bizarre. \r\n\r\nThe college President is wrapping up his career and is clearly coasting at this point - or at least trying to. There's next to no strategic, long term vision for the institution whatsoever and whatever it is that resembles that is poorly thought out, communicated and executed. The long and short of it is, they're doing everything to balance the books and keep it that way so the next guy can come in. It's frustrating, because the campus has a lot of potential at this point - and every day wasted feels like a day wasted. \r\n\r\nIn addition to a President who doesn't seem to really care; the one thing about AIC that really sticks out negatively is their ability to find terrible managers, install them and then enable and excuse their behavior. There are about four actors on campus who are a significant impediment to getting anything done - and display all the kinds of characteristics of people who clearly shouldn't be in those positions on a regular basis. The trickle down effect - whether it be project management, trying to work across silos, the quality of hiring people and culturally is enormous. AIC could be a poster child for being a place where you can actively see the sheer amount of damage a few bad apples can do to an entire institution. Entire projects are nuked, entire offices are chased off and pushed out, bosses not staying in their lane... it's remarkable how much damage gets done; but what's worse is how much is enabled, ignored or excused by top level management.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame - because the potential at the school is enormous.\r\n\r\nOh and if you want to get paid? Forget it. This place pays well below market level. One manager was pinned down and not promoted until he/she was afforded another opportunity. Then all of a sudden, there was a magical $30k that was offered to stay. How they expected that person to do that and come back to a staff who hasn't received a raise in 2-3 years is something, but they did it. They don't value their best employees and pay for it - not only in terms of productivity but in terms of damaging their reputation in the community.\r\n\r\nNow of course, the pay issue is partly what exacerbates what we're discussing above. Good managers won't work at the salary rate the school offers. So they regularly drag out hiring processes longer than necessary (at significant expense to the college), and end up picking people they're not crazy about to begin with - or just flat out garbage managers. It's an amazingly self-defeating cycle."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Student Libary Assistant in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "they are flexible with work schedule", "cons": "There are no cons I can think of"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "something to look for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Assistant Non Teaching in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "you are going to have time to study and make some income on the side", "cons": "there is no overtime if you looking for that"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great experience overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Area Coordinator in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diverse \r\nFlexible \r\nCompassionate coworkers\r\nLots of room to be creative", "cons": "Many evening and weekend requirements"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "AIC", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Coordinator in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great students and tuition remission", "cons": "location (Springfield, Mason Square), pay, job stability"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "If I knew then....would not have taken this job", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 May 2017", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A number of dedicated students who take their classes seriously and have at least the minimal or above skills to be in college.

Many of the students seemed to have the maturity of high school or even middle schoolers and spent the class time jabbering or showing each other stuff on their phones.  Only a handful read the book. (In fairness, there are many students who can handle the work and come to classroom prepared, so I want to emphasize that this criticism does not apply to all of them -- just enough to make teaching at AIC very difficult.  I suppose if I had stayed at this college, I could have adjusted and managed the behavior better, but it made sense for me to  just return to teaching environments where the pay was higher and the students more mature to begin with.\r\n\r\nSports -- Sports is a great thing at the school, but it leaves the students little time to do schoolwork.\r\n\r\nParking.
