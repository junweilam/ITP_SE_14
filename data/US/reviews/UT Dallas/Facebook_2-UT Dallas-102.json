A month later I was ambushed in my \"one on one\" weekly reviews by the director and was suddenly receiving weekly reviews with both my supervisor and the director without notice or explanation. At each review I was grilled over any single typo made on the web. It should be noted that there is no staging environment and no QA or review process. The weekly reviews were so harsh that I began to see a therapist to cope with reviews. They finally offered me the opportunity to quit before they terminated me for spelling mistakes. As they documented every single mistake, I can tell you there were less than 20 over the 10 month period. They were cruel and there was no one above them to hold them accountable for any management style. Their offer of termination was mercy and my therapist agrees.
