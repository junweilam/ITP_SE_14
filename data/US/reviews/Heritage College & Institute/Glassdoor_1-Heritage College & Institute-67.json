Although there is a lot of structure, which most people mistake for micromanagement when it is in fact regulatory requirements, Heritage invests in its employees for the future.  Executive leadership targets up and coming employees, especially in Admissions, due to the fact that they learn structure and regulations as a part of their time learning the business.  The recruiting aspect along with learning time-management and organizational skills makes Admissions employees ideal for advancement opportunities.  The envrionment, however, is not for everyone.  The state and federal governments, along with accreditation guidelines, make the admissions department a managed place.  Scripts ensure compliance with regulations, many mistake the use of scripts as \"managment control\", when in fact there are greater reasons.  Admissions managers sit in on student calls and meetings to ensure Admissions employees are giving correct information to students; if the information is incorrect, a regulation could be compromised.

Most of the day I felt like a cheap telemarketer.  The management would mentally and verbally break you down by not meeting their enrollment goals even though several things were beyond our control for why somebody could not commit to starting school- here are a few for example:  People who lied about having a GED, people who were in student loan deferrment, people who simply could not afford $30,000 for a one year program, people who were smart enough to go to a community college for an equal program at a 10th of a price, people who went to prison... the list goes on and on.  Still, no matter what management will come back and say \"well you obviously didn't motivate them enough.\"  They always say motivating the unmotivated is very difficult which is true- we can't force losers to wake up one morning and be a different person when they have been a dead beat their whole life.  The hours were terrible too- if we were scheduled to work until 7pm and somebody showed up to the admissions department at 6:59 we had to spend the next hour and half with them regardless.  Rarely did I get out of there on time.  There is virtually no growth in this company either.  The stafff turnover is like a fast food joint.  We were required to use very strict scripts when interviewing potential students- I can't tell you how many times I was told that our questions were demoralizing and demeaning.  The micro managing is insane!  Management will listen in on your calls and sit in your office looking for any opportunity to cut you down even more.    This place is the most miserable place I have ever worked in my life.

Hound anyone who has ever contacted Heritage (either directly, or by mistake) THREE times a day. This includes using a cell phone with different numbers in the hopes that they won't recognize the number and will pick up. Even if the person hangs up on you, you are instructed to continue calling...\r\n\r\n2. Handle direct questions, such as \"how much does it cost, or what is the program length\" with the most evasive answers possible. I was instructed to never give out any information and to find a way to \"take control\" of the call and get them to give you answers about their life and why they want this. IF they mention a program Heritage doesn't offer (music, being a barber) you are still instructed to try to get them to come in for a \"required information session.\" \r\n\r\n3. Same-day appointments are gold to this company, as they are with any sales... Get them while they are hot! Unfortunately, Heritage doesn't think there is any way someone could be serious about their education if they are not ready to drop whatever they are doing to come in for the \"required information session.\" After you get off these phone calls, you will be chastised about why you didn't do enough to \"motivate\" them.\r\n\r\nThe entire process is paternalism at its worst. The costs of the programs are asinine and most students realize this after doing more research and choose to go somewhere else where they won\u2019t be saddled in $20000-$30000 of debt for a job that might only pay them $8 an hour. Of course, if the admissions rep doesn\u2019t find a way to convince that student to choose Heritage, you have failed.\r\n\r\nI originally thought this job would be helping people to change their lives, but I found myself engaged in the sales job from hell\u2014working with and for people with no integrity or respect. This job is an embarrassment to my resume and I can\u2019t believe I even worked at a place who would treat people like this.

This school costs at least 20.000.00/ and the only thing it has over my 7000.00 education is a one week course in Psychology that is irrelevant to the fields of study and this allows them to charge for an associates which is non transferable to any other school.
