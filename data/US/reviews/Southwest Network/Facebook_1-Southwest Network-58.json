However the upper management must understand that the staff are just human.  When my CD and RD let me go it was not because I wasn't a good CM. They even told me this.. It was due to the fact that I cared more for my members than getting my productivity in.  They did not have a choice but had to let me go. This left my team short and now not only having to deal with their members but also mine. Upper management needs to come and spend a week as a CM doing the same work in the same time frame and then state that getting the productivity is possible. I got tired of hearing that others were able to get their units in.  The ones that I know did never went out in the field. They did not meet with members that much. They a couple of minutes on the phone and then were able to bill a unit even if the call was only a minute long.  It is easy if you spend eight hours and only have to make 20 phone calls.
