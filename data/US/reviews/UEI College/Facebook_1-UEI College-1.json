So I\u2019m well aware of the standards that should be held, which UEI is failing to meet. Management is below standards in their handling of employees and school regulations. The type of treatment of their employees and students are degrading. At one point the DOA saying I should rush a student through the enrollment paperwork because the student has ADHD. At that point I realized I might as well be working for a car dealership instead of a college. There\u2019s no incentives for registrations and instead of building up employees to meet their goals as other colleges do, UEI uses fear and demoralizing tactics. For those that like working here they have thrown their morals out the window. I decided to leave because morally I could not endorse this type of workplace. After having documentation showing the DOA singling employees out and giving the statement of the DOA about demeaning mental illness, HR and the campus president agreed it be best for me to not work with her. In which I decided to resign. Instead of them saying they will ensure to address the issues of the admissions department management. Overall a complete waist of time.

You are allowed 1 hour per week for prep time, not doing anything more then just printing things from the schools portal takes longer then one hour.  The pay is the lowest in the industry, and the ridiculous rules the company comes up with are a out of touch with the classroom.  You are told to be at what is known as \"stand up\" at the beginning of the first break, that is 50 minutes after you start your class.  This stand up requires that you call your students to find out why they are not in class. on the surface this seems like its ok, however, if our goal is to teach our students, then this is taking away from valuable teaching time, and the students that are present are left waiting for you to call the other students.  By the time you get to a point where you should call the missing students, because you know there is no stragglers coming in, you are well into your lecture.

The students, period and nothing else.", "cons": "1. Staff Complaint - Visit (or Google Map) IEC headquarters in Irvine, and then compare it a local UEI, U.S. College, Florida Career College, or anything under IEC's umbrella. Pay attention to the luxury cars headquarters at IEC, vs. the typical jalopies in the local UEI, U.S. College, Florida Career College staff parking. This should tell you how much they get paid vs. how under paid and underappreciated you will be if you work here. This should also be a note for potential students, on how much you are getting ripped off.\r\n\r\n2. Staff Complaint - I worked at the UEI College in Chula Vista for almost 9 years. This place is ran locally with no HR department. Long story short, I had my security clearance investigator call to check if I worked there in the past (I included former supervisor's name, phone, and email, along with front desk number), and they misdirected my investigator in the wrong direction, rather than helping a former employee out.     \r\n\r\n3. Staff Complaint \u2013 This school places so much emphasis on student attendance because they are paid $50 per hour every student is in attendance. Rather than teaching the students, there are staff training periods and actual school time dedicated towards locating these missing students. If you would rather teach, than report your numbers, this is not the place for you. Trust me, I\u2019ve seen many good teachers get replaced because of this one thing because we are all extremely expendable with this company\r\n\r\n3.  Student Complaint - I've never felt so guilty in my entire life. I helped this company rip-off 100s of students immediate and long-term futures by being a snake oil salesman. All of those former students are still paying outrageous loans with minimum wage jobs they could have just gotten from their own high school education or through a temp agency. Please please please do your own homework before picking up that phone or talking with the school's admission reps: \r\n* Read the Yelp, BBB, Glassdoor, and other Student/Consumer Complaint reviews. From my own first-hand experience, 95% of those complaints, are 100% valid.\r\n* Visit a local UEI and find a student on the brink of graduating or going on intern/extern, and ask them if their new career job is secure (not temp or probationary) and how many of their classmates have secure jobs, as well, or at all.  \r\n * ~80-90% of the programs offered here are either outdated, or you do not need UEI's so-called diploma to get you the job. For example, a CompTIA A+ certificate is not enough to get your foot in the door of the IT world. Just look around your own neighborhoods and see how many customers go through a computer/ cell phone repair kiosk? Also, you can get a guard card for .016% of the price of going through UEI's Criminal Justice program.\r\n* Find the LinkedIn accounts to your local UEI's staff. At least from what I witnessed from my 9 years of working there, a lot of the staff do not have college degrees themselves. In fact, some of the staff were former students with 1 year of working experience.
