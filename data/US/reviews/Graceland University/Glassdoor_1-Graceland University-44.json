This is displayed in their blatant disregard for procedures, contracts, and morals. Additionally, their constant gaslighting and manipulation creates a toxic environment of ambiguity. No one is safe from the wrath of Pres. Draves. \n\nThis institution used to be a loving and close-knit community. Faculty felt supported and morale was high. Since faculty and departments are pitted against each other, it is an incredibly fragile balance to tread. There is no longer trust amongst colleagues. \n\nAs stated, admin have zero respect for students. No concern for the safety and well-being of the students. Known title 9 violations are not dealt with. Rather than providing justice for victims, admin opts to silence the issue to protect the image. \n\nAdditionally, Admin doesn't prioritize quality education. This is apparent in the high faculty turn over. While many leave to escape the school, many also ' leave' because they weren't deemed submissive enough. They opt to replace and replace and replace quality professors to find someone who is easy to manipulate and who aren't 'in it' for the future of the students. \n\nFinally, nepotism should be Graceland's motto. That is how the school operates. To have a chance at a successful future at GU, you must be connected to very important/influential Graceland-ers. Usually this occurs by some relationship- marriage, donor relative, past roommate/best friend, married to the president. If you don't have those connections, chances are you won't last long or you'll constantly feel as if you are disconnected, isolated, and unwelcome."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "GU Worker", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 May 2022", "job_title": "Writing Center Tutor in Lamoni, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working as a writing center tutor at Graceland was an amazing experience and opportunity.
