Paid time off is generous and benefits are decent, but the pay is low. I've worked for 2 different departments and some are awful and some are pretty good just depending on where you are. Pretty forgiving with employees from what I've seen (people that should've been fired for being bad at their jobs are often given second chances). The biggest pro is the free education for employees and their spouses/kids, but I'd say working here isn't worth it if you're not using this benefit.", "cons": "Pay is awful. I make 41k a year in a job where the standard is around 50k, and this isn't just my current position/department. Pretty much every department is underpaid by a lot so people just end up using working here as a stepping stone to finding better-paying jobs. This isn't a case of a struggling university either as almost every year has record enrollment levels (and record revenue/profits). The money just seems to be spent on crazy building projects, the student experience, and the executives/high-profile sports coaches. There is also an annual Cost of Living paycheck (which in the past was called a bonus) which is very deceptive as it is given out right around Christmas time which gives it the appearance of being a Christmas bonus when in reality it's a standard Cost of Living raise that every company gives out every year, but instead of spreading the money out through each paycheck throughout the year, you get it all at once to make it appear that you got a Christmas bonus when in reality you didn't. They did give out a $1000 Christmas bonus in 2021 in addition to the CoL paycheck, but they didn't continue this again in 2022. Pay raises are also handled ridiculously in my department. In the vast majority of companies, a pay raise is calculated based on how well you perform and yet every single raise I've gotten in the 7 years of working here has been a flat $1,000. I've always gotten above-average perfomance reviews, but why even try harder to be a good employee if you're going to get the same flat raise as those who are putting in less effort, worse quality work, or who have a worse attitude? You also have to deal with being somewhat associated with the latest Liberty drama as well which isn't a huge deal to me personally, but I'm sure liberal employees hate it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes",

The health insurance is outstanding, education benefits are helpful, and some of the other perks (gym, misc. discounts) are a nice add-on. Most positions are incredibly stable, and with some effort you can move up quickly (depending on the department).", "cons": "The most common complaint you'll hear at Liberty is the gap between what Liberty pays versus other employers. Because Liberty is a non-profit, the ranges are considerably lower than other organizations. The frustration comes from a seemingly endless building and campus improvement budget, but little to no salary improvement efforts. Liberty is able to pay a lower salary range because of the other benefits; despite a high turnover rate, there will almost always be someone willing to fill a position because of education or health benefits. Discussing your salary is a fireable offense. \r\n\r\nHuman Resources is one of the most frustrating entities to work with. During my time at LU, it seemed as if HR was actively working against the employees. The constant secrecy and clandestine nature does nothing to improve this perception. \r\n\r\nExecutive level employees seem to be in a different class, where the rules don't apply to them - leading to frustration of lower-level staff members. Executive level issues come across as petty, while some more serious issues affecting lower-level staff are ignored. For a long period of time, there was an incredible fear of administration. Stories and rumors of people being let go for speaking up about serious issues abound, and everyone knows someone that was let go for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. This isn't as prevalent as it used to be, as administration has changed, but it is definitely an element.\r\n\r\nSome of the staff work environments are not that exciting. Part of the campus is a former factory that was gifted to the university. While the portions that students will see have been remodeled, the sections a large part of staff work in need to be renovated. I can think of a bathroom that hasn't been remodeled to any extent since the early 1980s.

Relaxed hours and ability to work from home when needed.", "cons": "Micromanaging is a plague at Liberty. Management simply does NOT trust their employees. They want every second of work you do to be logged. Liberty is very metric heavy. Management wants metrics on things that are essentially meaningless to them. All of the time tracking and metrics gathering is a colossal waste of time that could be put to better use. Expect to spend an hour each day recounting what all work you have done. This includes phone calls, replying to emails, being stopped by coworkers, and of course the hour wasted logging time.\r\n\r\nNepotism run rampant. One stands a better chance at a raise or a promotion if you are good friends and/or related to a higher up. A lot of the politics get in the way because of this. Frequently, more important work will be sidelined because someone needs something and they are friends with a VP. Because this is so effective, name dropping is used a lot to expedite less important work.\r\n\r\nManagement lacks a lot of transparency and will, a lot of time, lie to employees just to keep them satisfied in the short term. Questions about certain things will be avoided or ignored. False promises are made to keep morale high. Promises of raises and promotions will be made with no follow through. Worse is, sometimes, they will give an unofficial promotion and not follow through with the official one. Because of this, you will be expected to do higher tier work at a lower tier pay. They will do anything to milk as much as they can from employees without actually compensating them for it.\r\n\r\nCommunication is atrocious. Policies will be put in place with no official communication about the policy. Employees are expected to follow these new policies despite having never heard of them. Structural changes in management are frequent and rarely relayed to the employees officially. It is very common for someone to have been your boss for over a month and you not know about it unless you keep up with the rumor mill.\r\n\r\nLack of prioritization. I touched on this earlier when talking about nepotism. Essentially, work that is actually important and work that you are told is important can be very different. Frequently, there is a constant struggle of what work should be done first. This task isn't a difficult task, but Liberty likes complicate things. Work will need to be pushed off because a VP needs something that could probably wait right now. Even your direct chain of supervisors will have a conflict on what work should be prioritized. This frequently leading to situations where your direct manager wants X done, your Director wants Y done, but the CIO has eyes on project Z. No matter which you prioritize you will be reprimanded.\r\n\r\nHaving your name on certain projects can have you put on a naughty list. No matter what role you play in a project, if that project goes south, you will be blamed for it.\r\n\r\nPay is well below industry standard. Liberty uses the Mission Statement as a way to take advantage of people who actually believe they are changing lives. Many of my former colleges are brilliant and talented individuals that would double their salary by leaving the company but fall trap in the belief of the Mission Statement.\r\n\r\nWorkload can sometimes be too much. I don't want to bash them too much for this as it is something they genuinely try to avoid. It is really a symptom of lack of experienced help. Due to Liberty's subpar pay, experienced employees leave en masse (a lot of the times to the same company). They are unable to hire any decent help externally as experienced engineers don't want the low ball offers. They end up moving people up internally. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as it does offer room for career improvement. The problem is that people leave so frequently that they end up having inexperienced Juniors in Senior level positions.\r\n\r\nBeing set up for failure happens a lot. Due to the turnaround of engineers, you will be put into positions way outside of your comfort zone. You will be expected to succeed when the odds are heavily stacked against you."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great coworkers, terrible pay", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Information Technology in Lynchburg, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I work within the IT organization, and the caliber of people that work in IT are for the most part incredible.

If LU was truly a pro-life and pro-family institution, then they should provide at least 2 weeks of paid paternal leave to their employees. \r\n\r\nYour shift is (supposedly) dependent upon seniority. The problem is you cannot move up to a better shift unless a better slot opens up. Better slots that are snatched up by new employees. The purpose is to provide each Advisor a different time of day to reach out to their students. The problem is it gives no stability of life to the employee. You could come to work at a different time every single day, or you can just work a consistent (yet terrible) schedule. \r\n\r\nMoving off the phones and receiving a promotion is ambiguous. Instead of posting opportunities for advancement to employees with appropriate work experience (1 year or more due to the high amount of turnover), promotions are given behind closed doors and announced via e-mail.

I only wish this school was genuinely Christian in the way it treats its employees. We sell the lack of tenure here as a method to route out heresy, but in fact it is license to fire whoever administration feels like whenever it conveniences them. Faculty of many departments are let go after decade(s) of service because online course offering forces shrinking of residential courses. There is NO FACULTY oversight of this \"university\". You are micromanaged in every aspect of your existence here and it gets worse with each passing year. No one complains openly because we're all afraid of getting fired. At my church, talking with my Sunday School teacher, I learned my experience is in fact pretty much universal. \r\n\r\nAt a usual school, it is sad to see too much taught by adjuncts because we know they are largely underpaid and undervalued. Here it is so much worse. The online adjunct for Liberty University Online is actually not even free to make their own course materials. For one, they are not paid enough to make it worth their time. But, worse yet, all modifications of the online course are made through the SME (subject matter expert). This adjunct or prof is the sole course coordinator. This pays less than $1000 per semester, or if the SME is not teaching, literally nothing. This SME is pretty much the only defense we have against the online course being wholesale copied by various cheat sites. Our defense is paper thin at best. Personally, I have come to believe this is by design because administration knows most of our online students are cheating. Money not excellence is their guide. More on this later.\r\n\r\nOne of our 5 Vice Provosts was fired in the middle of a semester with no explanation to the faculty except a vague email to \"not contact her, she was ok...\" . See what you find about that. Probably nothing, because this place has a stranglehold on local media.  What other university would tolerate a beloved Vice Provost being terminated with seemingly no cause mid-semester? I cannot state the name here due to community guidelines and this person has not spoken up since I'm guessing a non-disclosure agreement is at play. Many of her subordinates quit after this since she was one of the only sane voices at her administrative level. \r\n\r\nMany good faculty are leaving her to work at Longwood University which is only about an hour from here. Many others who have been let go work at the CC across the street. Still others cannot find jobs because they were let go after more than a decade of service for essentially no cause.\r\n\r\nOf course, finding controversy here is hard since it seems the University President has a team of editors devoted to scrubbing away truth about Liberty on the Wikipedia page. \r\n\r\nI am truly sorry that so many parents send their children here because they buy the hype. If you are looking for a school where faculty really are able to mentor your kids one-on-one then look elsewhere. The faculty/student ratio here is sad, and don't be fooled by the conflation of online adjuncts with actual faculty. Do you want your kid's course to be some internet prof's part time job ?\r\n\r\nThis is not a selective school. If you have money they will take it. \r\n\r\nLiberty University Online is a home for outright cheating. It is well-known among those who teach online that there is a significant portion of the students using cheat sites to take their classes. The faculty have requested that online courses have tests which are proctored. In fact,the Philosophy Department showed that residential students were cheating the online intro to Philosophy course about a decade ago by simply forcing them to take the test in a monitored room. The grade distributions were markedly lower when the students were proctored.\r\n\r\nWhat did the university do when wide-scale cheating was shown likely by a department ? NOTHING. In fact, I have seen administration punish faculty and departments who stand up for academic excellence. Not only are they not interested in catching cheaters and protecting the reputation of our degrees, they are invested in covering up and making it hard to see the breadth and depth of the cheating happening here. In the past decade we have radically weakened punishments for cheating. The online adminstrative leader was instrumental of rail-roading new cheating policies through the Faculty Senate which now essentially make cheating a total joke. It used to be we could assign an F for the course if we found they had used a cheat site to do a test (keep in mind, ALL online tests for LUO are OPEN BOOK & OPEN INTERNET, so the value of an LUO degree is pretty much open to debate!). Now, we just get a 30% deduction on an assignment.\r\n\r\nAlso notable, we had a grade of Fd for Failed with Dishonestly. That was removed because it is easier to paper over cheating with a simple \"F\".\r\n\r\nSeriously Christian parents, send your kids somewhere else. This place is not worth your money or your child's time. It pains me to write this but, someone needs to start stating this plainly.  \r\n\r\n Consider this, we have residential students who take tests in classrooms with actual supervision of professors. Yet, online, we are forbidden from instituting proctoring in the courses. It is plainly fraudulent.\r\n\r\nNow, students are at times at the hands of extortionists because they hire someone to take the course for them and then the criminal they hired turns and extorts them for money. If LUO allowed the faculty freedom to put proctoring in their courses then this criminal mischief would be largely ended.\r\n\r\nLUO has a profit margin of 80% or so and yet we refuse to pay our online adjuncts any reasonable portion. In addition, the school works hard to redefine roles to keep workers from working \"full-time\" jobs. This sort of gamesmanship with federal regulation is just the routine here. You're never safe here because your worth as an individual created by God is meaningless to administration. No, we don't care about people, we care about profits. Administration may say otherwise, but their actions speak to a wholesale disdain for the work of faculty.", "cons": "-Faculty parking is non-existent. The CC across the street has more respect for faculty.\r\n-No tenure or safeguard for online corruption of your residential load\r\n-No freedom to teach in online setting, all courses same and cannot even insist on proctoring to reduce cheating.\r\n- Hiring process ridiculous, administration forces regular overloading to avoid new hires as status-quo. Also, 5/5 load ASSUMES scholarly production in peer reviewed journal in addition to teaching for promotion. \r\n- So much institutional inbreeding. We hire our own, and the nepotism connected with the president of the university is everywhere.  Look up the article \"papered over\"  or search for \"South Beach Flophouse\" to see more details which I cannot put  here due to Glassdoor community guidelines.\r\n-only stand up for traditional morality when it benefits our bottom line.

Unless employees were doing terribly, everyone would receive a 50cent an hour raise at the same time every year. Otherwise, if you weren't moving up you weren't getting a raise, even if you had been there for a long time and were great at your job. Poor benefits, specifically time off. You have to submit written requests for time off, 5 paid sick days, 10 vacation days, unpaid time off was not a thing.  Unprofessional leadership. Liberty's SFS still has a write up policy behind which management hides when there is conflict. While there might be a place for this kind of policy when dealing with behavioral issues, employees should not have paperwork sent to HR if they make minor errors in their work. Promotions were based solely on call scores and not at all on leadership ability. If you get tired of being treated like crap and want to move to a different department within Liberty, you have to get permission from your boss' boss' boss to apply for these positions. It could be from facilities to running events for the business school and it wouldn't matter. Management actively looks to promote people who will do only what they are told and not ask questions. This has become a major issue across multiple departments. Because these supervisors are unused to conflict, they have a lot of trouble training/correcting/confronting agents. Of the dozens of meetings I had one on one with my direct supervisor, there was only one in which they were able to address an issue in my calls. Once I suggested that it could help the team if the supervisor made our individual meetings shorter so they had time to listen to more calls (and be more familiar with each agents ability) and pull people off the floor for less time. Huge mistake! The supervisor got offended and said that they didn't have enough time to listen to more calls because they were too busy. Everyone in our 12 person team had the same experience in those meetings, 50 minutes of talking about nothing, 10 minutes of talking about work. \r\nHR is next to unavailable, especially since they are on a separate campus and only send over a representative once a year. \r\nThere is a double standard when it comes to compensation and expectation. Employees are expected to make work their priority, but are treated without respect. \r\nMaternity leave is short. No paternity leave. \r\nYou have to pay for your parking pass, it is taken out of your paychecks. Even though they own the parking lots, you still need to pay for the pass.\r\nEducation benefit is not worth it. You get 18 credit hours a school year (F/S/Summer) and their programs change frequently so you may end up working for your degree for extra years. The majority of the classes online are formatted so that the \"professor\" has as little work to do as possible. It would be worth it to find another job, save up the money, and then take off 2 years to attend a program in person. \r\n\r\nCompany culture? Treat people like high school students at a private christian school. Strictly enforce the parts of a conservative working environment that have little correlation to productivity and focus on making the school more money, even if it screws over the employees and the students. \r\n\r\nWhile we were there, Liberty cut back institutional scholarships for their students and increased tuition. Meanwhile they were building a brand new olympic training facility. While it might be nice for students to have that, the majority of the parents I spoke to on the phone would have preferred a decrease in tuition over a new unnecessary facility. \r\nMy advice to a potential employee?

A couple years ago, senior management launched an employee satisfaction initiative they entitled, \"You Matter.\" Basically, they wanted to boost morale amongst employees so they created an internal PR campaign designed to make us feel like what we do is important. It's pretty standard for any business to do such things. However, part of the launch of the \"You Matter\" campaign was a meeting wherein every employee was required to attend. \r\n\r\nAt said meeting, senior management promised to hire an outside economic firm to compare every employee's salary to the national average for that particular field. They promised that they would release the study in August of 2012 and that everyone would likely get a raise. Employees were extremely excited about that prospect, since it's pretty well known that Liberty does not pay well.  Rather, they don't pay rank-and-file employees well. All senior management have salary and benefits packages in the six-figures according to the IRS. It has been almost 2 years and employees have yet to hear about that raise. Some people familiar with upper management say they are just hoping employees forget about that promise.\r\n \r\n\"You Matter?\" To many of us, that phrase has become a sarcastic punch line at the end of in-office jokes. Upper management talks about how much the employees matter, but there is a UNCOMMONLY HIGH turnover rate. This doesn't really concern the management though, because each year the residential side of the university cranks out 3,000 more fresh graduates, many of whom stay in Lynchburg and need jobs.

I was told too that I would receive a pay increase if I had excellent job performance and I accepted the lower paying job since I was promised more pay. I received an awesome review, they loved my job performance, but couldn't offer me 'more pay at this time'.  Itwas an incredibly upsetting experience for me. When I left LU, 2 other employees in my department were leaving for similar reasons and then 2 more left a few weeks later. Maybe other departments are different but I would urge you to ask around. Talk to people before accepting a job."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "good co workers, junk environment", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Lynchburg, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good tech, coworkers are great. gain good experience", "cons": "pay is horrible.
