Also there is no room for growth - most positions are dead end jobs though management will tell you otherwise during the hiring process. On that note, management is TERRIBLE - they do not care about their employees at all, you'll just be a number to them that is easily replaced. They certainly do not take constructive criticism or try to improve operations when a problem is pointed out.  They will exploit you to the fullest, putting more and more demands on employees and use the excuse that it's part of the \"other expectations as set by supervisor\" in the job description.  Don't even think about saying that it is too much, or you'll get written up - and definitely don't get overtime, because you'll get in trouble for that too. Management only knows how to function by using fear tactics rather than actually trying to help employees grow and succeed. They have completely forgotten that we are here to take care of patients, not to appease their whims. This has lead to a toxic work culture where everyone from front desk to back office to operations is overworked and stressed out.
