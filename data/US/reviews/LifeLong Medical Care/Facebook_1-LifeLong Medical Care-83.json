I was fired \"without cause\" shortly after filing paperwork for my official name change and mere days before a gender confirming surgery for which I had accrued medical leave.\r\n\r\nA few months ago I was let go from what had been my dream job providing mobile medical services to unhoused folk in Oakland and I was and am heartbroken, ashamed, confused, frustrated, and angry. At the time this happened I was deeply committed to my work, was receiving positive feedback from patients, coworkers, and supervisors, and I believed my career was flourishing. Then out of the blue, I was sent a text message at 7am on a Friday telling me that my schedule had been cancelled for the day and that I was not to go to the clinic but rather report to the administrative offices for a meeting. There I was told that my \u201cservices were no longer needed.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was given no official reasons for this, had been given no warnings written or otherwise, had received no improvement plan, had not even been given a bad review (no review of my work had been conducted at all). I asked whether I had hurt a patient (I had not) or if they would be filing any action against my license (they would not). I was asked for my keys, presented with my final pay, and told not to ask for a job reference (even for the purposes of confirming my clinical skills). My patients and coworkers with whom I had developed deep connections were not warned or informed, only told that I had \u201cbeen transitioned,\u201d implying that I had perhaps abandoned them selfish reasons.\r\n\r\nThis crushed me. It was only a few days before I would complete my first year on the job, a year of extraordinary dedication, risk, and sacrifice undertaken to keep the clinic doors open to vulnerable patients continuously throughout the pandemic and smoke-filled fire season. For much of that time I had been the only full-time provider on staff (the other two MDs had other jobs on hospital wards) and had taken on a lot of additional responsibility without reliable support or mentorship. It was a year during which I withdrew from my support networks in observation of strict isolation protocols (the risk entailed in my job was unavoidable and it felt unconscionable to subject others to the same). Because of this I claimed no sick leave of any kind, even as nearly all my coworkers claimed 14 days of \u201cCovid leave\u201d following ill-advised air travel or indoor gatherings.\r\n\r\nTo make matters even worse, this happened when I was in the vulnerable final days of preparation for my facial feminization surgery. Losing my job at precisely that time meant termination of my insurance coverage just days into my difficult recovery. It meant that I would not be paid my salary during my convalescence. I would also be denied any compensation for my accrued medical leave, which was forfeit on separation. I had my sense of financial and professional security ripped away, just before I would enter a period of significant physical and emotional insecurity. Even my future career was threatened: this had been my only employer since graduating from nursing school and they would not in any way acknowledge my 2 years of dedicated labor should I go looking for another job. And worst of all, in the absence of an explanation I was left to speculate about what I had done to be rejected so suddenly and dramatically.\r\n\r\nThe final insult was that this happened less than a week after I submitted paperwork to my employer for my official name change. I had been ecstatic to finally see my identity reflected on official documents like patient charts instead of my dead name. Instead, I was let go on the very day that this change went into effect."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent Community Health Center", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Senior Project Manager in Berkeley, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great satisfaction for supporting access to medical care.

The schedule is crammed to the max. At the time, patients could only see one provider a day, meaning that they had to make multiple trips for different visits. Although there is an emphasis on providing quality care, the financial bottom line still motivates many of the clinic's decisions, making it challenging to remain patient centered. Sometimes the clinic feels like a machine. The work culture was mostly positive although there was a division between providers and medical support staff. The benefit package was good, but not free. Employees pay for it out of their checks. If you clock in and clock out, as support staff do, no overtime was granted, making it difficult to always do one's job effectively.
