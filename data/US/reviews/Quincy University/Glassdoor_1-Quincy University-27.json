As a result, most faculty teach 5+ classes just to survive. Benefits are getting steadily worse (healthcare OPE are now a minimum of $6k and up to $12k for a family, and retirement is next to nothing). Furthermore, once you're hired, you can expect a maximum raise of 2% per year. This place makes it incredibly hard to survive, and despite multi-million dollar donations, they continue to report financial losses to faculty every year. Hard to be optimistic about the future of this organization or its employees, which is probably why most new employees only stay a couple of years."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Athlete Oriented - If play, then pass", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 May 2023", "job_title": "Associate Professor in Quincy, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small classes, collaborative faculty colleagues, support from staff in other departments, easy to get around campus", "cons": "Most students are athletes and are there only to play a sport, absolutely no interest in academics or learning, complain routinely to VP of Student Success about grades and no ability to submit late assignments, students do nothing and have no basic skills, many say they are there to only play sports and expect to pass, students have no consequences for poor performance, they spend < 30 minutes per course on homework, about 3 hours per semester per course.
