These benefits include; health insurance plans (with optional FSA), dental, vision, 401(k) retirement (with employer match!), PTO, paid holidays, tuition reimbursement, EAP, and both short and long term disability.\r\nSt. Coletta provides exceptional classroom and on-the-job training that equips their staff (even those who may be inexperienced) with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to be successful.

Weekend or overnight asleep positions are great options available for college students like me who have complex schedules.

Starting with the visual of the client\u2019s homes, all the way down to daily interactions and activities offered, St. Coletta screams family. Staff support clients, clients support staff, and clients support each other. Whether it be cheering each other on at Special Olympics or enjoying a holiday feast together, unity and passion are at the forefront.
