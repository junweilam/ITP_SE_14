That in itself should say how this place is. - Management was just never happy with how above and beyond I really went and how loyal I was and how my work ethic was displayed.

This is a problem at most nursing facilities but they have a problem filling holes. You're constantly working short. Management barely shows their appreciation for the\" lower\" staff members. A lot of things seemed to diminish or change after the pandemic hit. Which is understandable, but once the world started getting better again, Elim didn't really pick back up. While they care very much about the appearance, especially on the Independent and Rehab parts of the building, once you go deeper into the building you start to notice the lack of attention. They used to offer all kinds insentives to employees to help with morale but no longer do. As a result you see a lot poorer work ethic. Management has such poor communication skills that no one knows what anyone else is doing and will often push work onto other employees when they don't know what to do."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Manager in Cheshire, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff was great to work with and the president of the Elim park was very involved.", "cons": "No communication between the managers."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good Place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Middletown, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Residents are delightful, work culture is supportive.
