When this happens, HQ staff are expected to polish a turd. It\u2019s one thing to collaborate on things together to build off each other\u2019s strengths and close weakness gaps; this is not that. Some teams have learned that there\u2019s no consequences for this kind of behavior, so they run with it; can\u2019t blame them. Every time this gets raised to management, employees are told to report it next time it happens, which they would, but nothing ever changed and the same cycle repeated time and time again. \r\n\r\nOverly prescriptive on the weirdest stuff, ignores the real issues - Staff will get guides with exact email language they should use to circulate a pdf, but no one seems to know who\u2019s responsible for more major tasks like managing financials on certain projects. \r\n\r\nOverloaded portfolios - No one at the mid level can do the quality of work they\u2019d like to do because they\u2019re overworked and have no admin support \r\n\r\nPost-COVID measures show zero care for what employees want - It\u2019s a widely known \u201csecret\u201d the founder doesn\u2019t like remote work. Staff have been told not to ask about it, despite there being a Columbia policy allowing it. In post covid times, teams had hoped there would at least be a conversation about what returning to work looks like. Instead staff got an email with a top down diktat about how this would be managed (spoiler: it wasn\u2019t sensitive to what people wanted, nor did it even ask employees what they wanted). Kicker is most staff are finding themselves commuting over an hour one way to sit in solo offices alone with their doors closed b/c of Columbia covid requirements, which they could frankly do from home without the stress or cost of a commute. A lot of people are leaving in response to this. When staff raised concerns about return to work and expressed a desire for a conversation about the new normal, they were shut down, which is quite on brand. There are far too many global health and global development orgs and companies out there doing things like employee surveys, and responding to what employees want, for them to be taking this approach. Frankly, people have options and they\u2019re going to exercise them if this keeps up. \r\n\r\nNo growth - No path for growth. If you look at the org chart, the mid level people with titles like \u201cSenior Blah Blah Blah\u201d are the bottom of the org chart, so they\u2019re supposed to be Senior Blah Blah Blahs while also doing insane amounts of grunt and admin work.
