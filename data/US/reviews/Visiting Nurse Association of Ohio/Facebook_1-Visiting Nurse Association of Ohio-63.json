They are under the false impression that the ENGAGE Committee is effective in keeping the employees engaged, when in reality, it is a colossal waste of time for all involved.  Like all organizations, there is a fair amount of office politics and favoritism that goes on here, but the President crosses the line by being too familiar/connected with certain employees.  I could go on and on about the lack of professionalism and inefficiencies of this organization, but you get the general idea.
