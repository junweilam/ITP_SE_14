I\u2019d like to give my personal view of these key drivers and where HSUS falls among them.", "cons": "I feel I am valued in this organization: \r\n\r\nHSUS overworks and underpays. This is well-known; almost every review you\u2019ll read here mentions it. \u201cValued,\u201d to me, means something different, though: it means how work is seen by superiors, how you are treated by executives and fellow staff, how you\u2019re recognized and communicated to about your work and contributions to the organization. People, myself included, leave HSUS because they don\u2019t feel valued by superiors or executives. How a nonprofit in 2017 can hew so closely to the \u201ccogs in a machine\u201d model is baffling. My team had massive, transformative success in their field while I worked there \u2014 but that success went consistently unnoticed and unrecognized \u2014 and in fact, expertise challenged on almost every topic imaginable. It was assumed anyone could achieve similar success \u2014 that the person didn\u2019t matter as much as the buttons getting pushed putting out decrees from executives. Strategy and experience were pushed aside, and instead, it was all about the next thing, about how that wasn\u2019t good enough\r\n\r\nHSUS has experienced overwhelming attrition over the last few years. Not because people don\u2019t feel passionate about the cause, or don\u2019t like their coworkers. HSUS does not value its employees. Full stop. \r\n\r\nI have confidence in the leadership of this organization;\r\n\r\nIf we are to trust our organization\u2019s leaders, they need to trust their employees. If employees are hired for their expertise, executives should trust that expertise. Public relation blunders aside, related to reshuffling the golden children (read: \u201cboys club\u201d is real, and going strong at HSUS!) rather than deal with their inappropriate behavior, leaders have no confidence in the people doing the work. They value instead outside opinions from vendors and agencies who gouge them endlessly \u2014 donor dollars, mind you \u2014 and sycophants who hang on, barnacle-like, willfully ignorant of how others feel or that there\u2019s a culture problem because they are \u201cin\u201d with executives. \r\n\r\nLeaders at HSUS have no confidence in their staff enough to foster, steward and retain employees \u2014 how can staff have confidence in them?\r\n\r\nI like the type of work that I do;\r\n\r\nPoint in favor: I loved the work I did at HSUS. This kept me there far longer than I should have stayed and boy howdy does HSUS know exactly how to take advantage of that!\r\n\r\nMost days, I feel I have made progress at work;\r\n\r\nAre you working 10+ hours a day? And available at night, and on weekends? If you struggle with work/life boundaries, HSUS will take that to the extreme. And if you respect your boundaries, you aren\u2019t committed to the cause. Even when progress is made, or a team achieves success, if that success doesn\u2019t fall into an executive\u2019s \u201cpet project,\u201d or isn\u2019t something they understand, or doesn\u2019t personally reflect positively on them \u2014 or doesn\u2019t fit within the extraordinarily narrow scope of leadership\u2019s myopic worldview, it isn\u2019t progress. \r\n\r\nEverything is a priority. Work is piled on endlessly without respect for workload or prioritization. Want to focus on something? Too bad; on to the next thing. And the next. Oh, and while you\u2019re at it, here\u2019s breaking news you had no idea was coming until you had to be on a conference call at 12p on a Sunday. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s often incredibly hard to feel like you\u2019re making progress when you work in animal issues. Animals are suffering and dying every single day, everywhere around the world, and most of the public achieves the cognitive dissonance to allow that to continue. The people who work at HSUS should feel like they re making progress as they address this issue; they are among the hardest working people I\u2019ve ever met. However, it isn\u2019t there. \r\n\r\nAt this organization, employees have fun at work;\r\n\r\nWhen among my team, yes. Many of my direct superiors worked overtime to provide some value and investment in my team \u2014 aware of work/life balance, boundaries, personal time, etc. That was difficult when not supported or invested in ways beyond that team. Without those people often killing themselves to rectify the otherwise suffering culture at HSUS, I\u2019m not sure who would be left. \r\n\r\nI can trust what this organization tells me;\r\n\r\nI learned to trust that promises often went unfulfilled, concerns unaddressed and unlistened to. I trust that HSUS is working on their mission \u2014 but as far as executives and HR go, there was no trust. \r\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m satisfied with this organization\u2019s benefits package;\r\n\r\nHSUS pays poorly and their HR is a mess; you can read any review here to find that out so I won\u2019t repeat it. Promotions are fought for with tooth and nail, and during my tenure there, were often miniscule. Instead of investing in employees, they have to kill themselves to fight for career growth and raises. Or title changes. A colleague was told, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t happy with this offer, you can keep doing your current job.\u201d \r\n\r\nBenefits are fine. Flexibility is available, which is a plus. You\u2019ll need it, because you\u2019ll be expected to be available 24/7.\r\n\r\nThere is room for me to advance at this organization;\r\n\r\nThe gap between middle management and executives is endless; it\u2019s a canyon from which decrees are made and minions are left to do the work. You might get a minuscule raise, but you won\u2019t get that title change. Or vice versa! It\u2019ll be a surprise, just like the offer letter you\u2019ll get with no room for negotiation; take it or leave it. \r\n\r\nMany of my middle management colleagues worked double time to get their work done and also protect their employees from the unrealistic expectation of executives, especially as teams grew smaller, budgets were cut, people were fired, and revenue goals or project goals or priorities did not change or evolve to adapt to new circumstances. And since executives are so completely out of touch with middle management and employee satisfaction, they are left to do their best to try to retain employees who take their marketable skills and go elsewhere \u2014 for more money, personal time, and investment. \r\n\r\nSo really, at HSUS,  the room for advancement is often through the exit. \r\n\r\nI like the people I work with at this organization; \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before: I worked on the same team with people who became my best friends. Lifelong friends. I still miss them every single day \u2014 and without everything else on this list, I would still be at HSUS. \r\n\r\nHowever: I have also never been spoken to or behaved toward the way I was when I worked at HSUS. Many people are rude, downright mean or cruel, and dismissive. Sometimes contemptuous. Some of this has to do with the fact people are overworked and underpaid; some of it falls under the banner of lack of boundaries and \u201cdedication to mission only.\u201d Executives included \u2014 and some are the worst offenders at all: some play on their multiple phones while employees are given presentations, told their expertise doesn\u2019t matter and that they know better, shut down, demeaned and made to feel insufficient, unqualified, under performing and pushed aside. I\u2019ve been in my new job for nearly a year, and I can say no one here has ever treated me once the way I was treated regularly at HSUS and felt. My new job has never made me cry or feel worthless \u2014 that\u2019s a huge plus! \r\n\r\nI feel part of a team working toward a shared goal.\r\n\r\nAgain: on my team, yes \u2014 without a doubt. As part of the larger organization, I didn\u2019t feel part of a team as much as a means to an end. I stayed because for a long time, that end (working to save animals) justified the means (see above). Eventually, I realized that unless or until I was part of the executive team, that would never happen. And that executive team is closed off in an ivory tower of unrealistic expectations and no true knowledge of how to run a successful business with happy employees."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Lots of gender discrimination!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Director", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Occasionally you get to experience helping animals hands on.

I left because of a terrible experience working for an unqualified manager who spent 40 hours a week micromanaging and harassing me. The sad thing is that this same manager pushed out another employee right before me. We both cited this manager's unacceptable behavior and treatment as a reason for leaving; nothing was done. I know multiple employees who have left due to bad managers. And these were good, smart, valuable employees. HSUS promotes people to management without qualification, even if they have a reputation for being difficult, and then it seems they are unwilling to demote them when they prove to be ineffective and even hostile managers. Their HR department is HUGE but massively ineffective. Their staff is all leaving because of bad managers. They are losing talent and ultimately this makes them less effective at helping animals because they're pushing out passionate, driven people with mismanagement. Which is easy to fix: If someone is a bad manager and you get multiple complaints, or people always leave after working under a certain person, do not let the manage employees. This is not hard! \r\n\r\nCulture - A few other reviews have mentioned the culture of \"chosen ones.\" It's true. If you're young, white, thin, extroverted and attractive -- this is the place for you! You'll go far. If you're older, fat, a person of color, shy or quiet and not a social butterfly -- you'll be ignored and then you'll be pushed out. Or you'll work for decades with no acknowledgement and then quietly retire. There is also a racist undercurrent to the HSUS; there are programs that deal with poverty and pets in Black and Hispanic communities, but they are created by and run by white folks and POC are simply tokens they hire to do outreach. (And the white folks train the POC on how to speak to people in their own community.) I sat through so many meetings with nice white ladies talking to other nice white ladies about the right way to talk to Black people. It was infuriating. The place is also, by and large, totally run by women. But who is at the top? White dudes in nice suits. They pointed over and over again to the number of female VPs and managers but the place has so many VPs and managers those titles are essentially meaningless, and at the end of the day, they all report back to the white men in suits. \r\n\r\nPay - Well below the industry standard. I worked there for years, and was \"promoted\" to a position that had a $0.20 raise per year. TWENTY CENTS. Per year. This was my raise. I was also coached (by management) never to talk about money at yearly reviews or even at interviews for new positions. People don't talk about what they make, but even those in management positions struggle and have to take on side gigs to survive. It's taboo, and HR supports that culture because they know they are underpaying their program staff. \r\n\r\nInstability - There are so many staff shake-ups and department shifts here that it never really felt stable. I swear there were about 3 big \"shifts\" in the time I worked there, so it was about 1 shake-up per year. It was always with the intent of making things better and more effective but then things would just move back to the status quo and everyone would settle in just in time for another shake-up. It's a waste of time, and I got tired of seeing these big shifts that were really just for show because leaders did not want to examine the root causes of these issues, because it would mean taking a long hard look in the mirror. So they just changed the names of departments and split them up into sections instead. \r\n\r\nLeaving broke my heart, because this was my dream job, but it was necessary for my mental health."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Director", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Director in Gaithersburg, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing, passionate, dedicated and smart co-workers.

The biggest issue at HSUS that unfortunately goes largely ignored are the overly large amount of incompetent and under-qualified people in middle/upper management positions. The \"Human Capital\" aka the Human Resources Department has had employee surveys over the past two years in response to the alarming rate of outgoing employees the organization has had and the surveys show clearly what people are unhappy about: inadequate management. To this day, the HR Department has done absolutely NOTHING to correct this glaring issue. The same trouble managers who drive out many solid employees with their stubbornness and lack of empathy towards fellow employees are still in their old positions. At HSUS, many employees feel the middle/upper management are invincible to some degree when it comes to their job security and it's obvious that if you're in middle/upper management, then you are officially a part of the \"managerial clique\" that lives on. At HSUS, it seems that as long as you're willing to sacrifice your entire life to the position and the cause which is animal welfare, then you absolutely have 100% job security no matter how horribly you treat your fellow employees and no matter how many basic managerial skills you lack. Over the last two years, the amount of outgoing employees compared to incoming has been almost DOUBLE! The fact that the Human Resources Department continues to keep its agenda of looking out for upper management has led them to losing much respect and trust from many employees, including myself. The organization also continues to cut positions and expect other employees to take on the extra workload without any type of compensation even though salaries are much lower than they should be for an organzation in one of the highest cost of living areas in the United States that is the Washington, D.C metro area. Because of these continuing issues that never change, I am currently looking to leave HSUS and will once I receive another job offer elsewhere. Things have DRAMATICALLY changed for the worse in the last two years especially and it's truly sad. If you're willing to work 24/7 and put your work in front of everything else in life, then you will advance at HSUS. If you don't, then you are frowned upon and will never move up.

It also misses some of the big marks: investing in morale, retention, and staff salary, particularly middle management. The C-Suite folks make six figure salaries. For the young, out-of-college, 21 and 22 year old kids coming into jobs, the HSUS pays great. Yet there's a huge swath of middle management folks who are underpaid, understaffed, overworked, exhausted, and demoralized, and stay simply because they love the mission and are desperate for things to improve. They haven't yet, and the attrition is testimony. Many people leave. Regularly.

This one proud organization thrived from showing compassion, treating their employees humanely and offering a very positive & thriving work environment. All of this is gone. Wayne & Co. have turned this organization from a diverse, laid back environment to an environment of extremist  who practically work around the clock seven days a week and ridicule anybody else who does not fit these attributes. Over the last two years, employee turnover has been astronomical with many of these positions not being refilled. Because of this, many employees are shouldering the work of 2-3 positions with subpar salaries and declining benefits/perks. The organization went from having the mentality of a pure non-profit who value their employees to a 100% corporate mindset where anybody is expendable at any time, especially long-term staff who aren't sipping the \"kool aid\" with the executive staff and upper management.\r\n\r\nSenior management at HSUS are a complete laughing stock. Senior management at HSUS typically consist of these \"skills\": Micro managing, bullying, being overly bossy, having over-inflated egos, very poor communication skills with colleagues, big lack of self-accountability, being hypocritical, showing serious lack of empathy for colleagues, expecting colleagues to work endless hours without appreciation and more. They do all of this while receiving excessive salaries while the rest of the organization struggles with subpar salaries. These managers feel invincible and are able to do anything and everything they want without any fear of repercussion. A large amount of staff has left because of excessive workloads and the dysfunctional management but nothing has changed and current employees are expected to handle even more excessive workloads without any type of additional compensation. \r\n\r\nSexual harassment towards female staff from certain male individuals who Wayne shown great favoritism has been a problem at HSUS despite his direct knowledge of these issues. In other words, sweeping it under the rug for years. This has been documented and recently been brought up to light. If you're a single female working at HSUS, you have to watch out for these certain males who will try to take advantage of your vulnerability and have made many women feel uncomfortable with their unwanted advances. These individuals are even people who are supposed to have your \"security\" at their best interest. Not!!\r\n\r\nWayne and Mike are as two-faced as they come that employees cannot trust anymore. Recently, HSUS decided to lay off 55 employees because of \"budget concerns\" despite their history or wreck less spending on unnecessary projects. Of course, the senior staff in charge of these financial decisions were not held accountable and were able to keep their positions. In the early summer all-staff meeting, Wayne Pacelle stood up in front of the staff and addressed the budget issues. He insisted cutting staff would not be an option because \"you, the staff are the organization's most valuable asset\". Several months later, 55 people were suddenly laid off. \r\n\r\nThe budget crisis unfolded this entire calendar year all while Wayne was busy writing and promoting his new book \"Humane Economy\" after the fact on a continuing book tour that many staff felt was being paid by HSUS funds. It seemed to some staff that he was more concerned with making revenue off of his new book and self-promoting his book and his image than addressing ongoing budget problems, excessive employee turnover and incredibly low morale. His continued disinterest in taking positive action for his own staff and his failure of fulfill on his own words truly show how much trouble HSUS will be in for a long time as long as he is in the CEO position.

Perhaps the best way to sum it up: Female employees are expected to attend company functions to talk to donors. This involves weekend and evening work, of course. They have to pay for their own meal. Not making that up. An employee is expected to give up a Friday or Saturday night to schmooze donors (including donors with a history of rape accusations, sexual harassment, etc) and then pay HSUS for the meal. Management has zero interest or ability in handling gender or race diversity or equality issues, pay equity, sexual harassment, massive overtime, or projects not getting done.
