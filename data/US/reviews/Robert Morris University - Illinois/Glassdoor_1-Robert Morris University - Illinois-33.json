The first round of layoffs took everyone by surprise. More followed. Eventually they cut any job that was not faculty or management, eliminated bonuses and some of the benefits programs, and still the school kept expanding its facilities, remodeling, etc at great expense. They then increased faculty (and chair) workload. My colleagues and myself might be asked to travel to Chicago in the morning to teach a class, and to Waukegan in the evening. It was exhausting and demoralizing. After about two years of cuts and staff layoffs, they began to lay off faculty. At this point, I quit and went to a different institution.

I loved this job when I first started, which is why my experience there ended up being so heartbreaking. My supervisor was amazing and incredibly supportive, and so were the people in my office. However, upper management, specifically the Provost, don't care about the individual people within the organization. (The President seemed non-existent during my time there - the Provost seems to run everything.)\r\nWithin a year of being there they restructured my department with a great new idea of how to improve things. When planning and implementing this great new idea, they never asked for feedback from us, the people who were actually in charge of this new program. Instead, they told us what we were going to do, but when they didn't immediately see the results they'd hoped for, they blamed us for poor implementation. I've worked at multiple universities in the past and was shocked by their lack of interest in opinions outside of their own - most universities create committees with various departments represented before implementing a far-reaching change - at RMU, the only opinions that mattered were those of the Provost and the few \"favorites\". (Let's be honest - there were a lot of people there whose promotions weren't based on merit.) Without giving time to see if the new program would work nearly half of the staff in our office were cut and the workload was redistributed amongst those who remained. Another round of layoffs later left even fewer people in our office, and once again the work was just redistributed. However, while the work was increasing, pay was not, and bonuses were discontinued. \r\nRMU always had a culture of \"do whatever you can for the student\", which I thought was great, but this mindset also meant that lunches were non-existent, as was leaving at a regular time. As this was the expectation of the university, it definitely was not to be questioned.\r\nAs previously mentioned, the upper-management at RMU played favorites, sometimes creating new \"Dean\" positions for people just to give them promotions. It is an incredibly top-heavy organization - at one point in time I had two bosses that I reported to and a third director all within my office of less than 5 people."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "I cried after my first day of work.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 May 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most of the staff and faculty are really great.

At the end of the day, I just could not believe what I had gotten myself into.  It really spoke volumes to how much they cared about me as an employee.\r\n\r\nWhile things got better and I eventually met great people and a  really great mentor, I interviewed for other jobs all during my time at RMU because the environment just didn't feel right.  For the most part, students were grateful for my help and really appreciative.  I really missed the majority of my students after I left for another position, but some of the practices just didn't feel right.  Departments were pitted against each other, there was an incredible disconnect between the few in power at the top and the rest of the workers, employees could be forced to change job roles without consent or face unemployment, and processes were very manual and antiquated.  The general feeling was that everything was done to keep the money machine moving, regardless of the effect on students and the dedicated staff.  And yes, this is a non-profit organization, but I would imagine working here feels very similar to a for-profit college.  Even my direct manager supported my search for other jobs because she knew that RMU was not a great place for a person to be given resources to grow professionally. \r\n\r\nI feel fortunate that I have moved on from RMU and can at least use my experience there as a guide for how not to manage my employees.

Over the past two years though, things seem to have really fallen apart. While they continue to admit first generation, low-income students, it really is starting to feel like they are just taking advantage of students. It is a non-profit school currently, but it feels like it is run like a for-profit. Things like instant admissions pull in students off the streets (literally in some cases) and get them registered for classes even before they have financial aid packages signed. Students also had to jump through several hoops to withdraw if they were not satisfied. \r\nWorking for RMU, the organization is top heavy. In one department there are two senior vice presidents, one senior manager, and five regular staff. Staff have little to no input on day to day operations let alone major changes. We were often asked for our opinions only to be told later that the decisions had already been made and we just need to get on board with them. On multiple occasions, in meetings with the provost, it was made it clear that questions should not be asked \"just to question,\" and her disapproving facial expressions discouraged any further discussion or dissent. It seemed that no criticism was acceptable let alone healthy debate on new initiatives. One of the most frustrating things was how changes would be implemented very quickly without forethought or much planning even. The \"big idea\" would be thrown into employees' laps and they would be expected to make it work without resources or time to implement. They would also be blamed for things that went wrong with it. After 10-20 weeks, another big new idea would come about without discussion. The old way would be eliminated without any measurement of success or discussion of pros/cons of the system. It became a morbid joke around the office that we could just ignore the emails about new policies or programs because they would be gone before we figured out how to make them work. \r\nMany staff have been laid off over the last two years. Some were well deserved, but most were good employees in key positions. Very few senior managers have been let go, while the ones who have been let go almost always were excellent performers who were willing to give honest feedback and opinions about problems. At the same time other favored employees continue to get promoted and are given raises, often creating new positions (positions that many staff can\u2019t see a clear need for) for them to attempt to succeed in. Those who have not yet been let go, are in danger of being shifted to a different position to fill open spots without considering the talents, skills or preferences of the employees. \r\n\r\nThe salaries are low, but they are not that out of line compared to other non-profit universities, but with little room to grow unless you somehow get into the good graces of someone with any real authority it is difficult to advance your pay or your career. At the same time Robert Morris has the fourth highest paid president in the state, and rumors ran rampant that senior presidents also made a large amount of money.  Something is out of balance. \r\nThe work-life balance is off as well. Very few senior managers seem to understand that employees have a life outside of work. We regularly missed lunches because of the flow of work. We were asked to work weekends as part of our salary job (but the hours were never compensated or made up during the week), and we were asked to work late into the night to finish tasks that might be discarded or not used at all. Every new quarter meant 13-14 hour days assisting incoming students and taking care of new admitted students. The culture was such that those who spoke out about these practices were looked down on and their commitment to the university and the students was questioned. My spouse has been so much happier since I left just because I am able to come home at normal times and do not have to put in so many extra hours on a regular basis."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "esports coach", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 May 2018", "job_title": "Coach in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cool environment, motivated players, great sponsors and setup.", "cons": "Awful administration, school doesn't care about the esports program at all despite boasting starting the first collegiate esports program in the country.
