High performers receive the same merit percentage as low performers; no incentive for doing an exceptional job.\r\n\r\n3)  Tenure is valued over employees' actual contribution and productivity.  Some tenured employees' unacceptable behavior and low productivity are overlooked and permitted by some mid-level and senior managers.\r\n\r\n4)  Process inefficiencies are tolerated by some mid level and senior managers.  Some employees and managers are reluctant to change.  \"This is how we've always done it\" plagues this organization.  \r\n\r\n5) Lack of support from senior management for mid-level managers and front line supervisors.  Lack of support ranging from training and education to corrective action for direct reports.\r\n\r\n6) \"Lead By Example\" is rarely practiced by senior managers.  \"Do What I Say and Not What I Do\" should be senior managers' motto.\r\n\r\n7) 95% of employees do not embrace and practice the organization's Service Standards of Behavior.  Every candidate for a position at OGHS is introduced to these awesome standards BUT rarely demonstrate on a daily basis.  The 5% of employees that do embrace and practice OGHS' Standards of Behavior are usually discouraged, disappointed and/or disgusted with the lack of consistency.\r\n\r\n8)  Rude and obnoxious behavior from front line employees and senior management is sadly tolerated and often times is overlooked.  \r\n\r\n9)  Some managers prefer to 'pacify' employees as opposed to help employees grow as professionals.  \r\n\r\n10)  There are several employees in managerial positions with minimal management skills and minimal education.  This is a prime example of how the organization values tenure over actual skill and contribution.  Also, there are some employees in managerial positions with proper education but severe lack of leadership and management skills.
