If you are called by God to do the work, then hang in there. It takes time to navigate a complex culture, establish your track record and build relationships. Don't lose heart in the first 12 to 18 months. You will hit your stride, but it takes time.\r\n\r\nThe need to mature quickly as an organization causes growing pains.

Intentional consulting, quick wins and established track records are rewarded.\r\n\r\nThere are high expectations for employees in a Christian workplace. Staff is passionate and has strong opinions. Some can personalize things that are not personal. The importance of building and maintaining relationships is critical to success. It can be exhausting.\r\n\r\nUnrealistic expectations for collaboration and input (and if it is given, that it will be incorporated). This can slow things down. At times, staff confuse input with decision making authority. People get frustrated with the pace and feel like they don't have autonomy in their roles. It's a work in progress. Senior leadership continues to communicate who has authority and accountability as well as to clarify roles and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nUneven management: Some gems, some frogs. Some senior leaders have come up through the ranks of the organization and are accustomed to hands-on involvement. At times, this can be maddening input on finer points miles away from the C-level. Another work in progress.\r\n\r\nCompassion is working on increasing US-based diversity, especially in leadership; limited opportunities for women in leadership.\r\n\r\nYour faith will be tested. God will prune and refine you. You have to be willing to die to yourself (ego, pride, personal ambitions). Satan does not like releasing children from poverty in Jesus' name. You will be sifted like wheat.\r\n\r\nWork/life balance can be a challenge when you're trying to save the world.

The mission of Compassion is noble.", "cons": "The mission of Compassion is great, the benefits they offer are great, the pay is so-so but not awful. But the company is riddled with issues. Issues that stem from corrupt management teams. Leadership holds hourlies to a higher standard than they hold themselves and hypocrisy is rampant. I worked in a department where the work in and of itself was rewarding, but management consistently broke their own rules; IE- Discussing inter-departmental-issues with a co-worker in the same department, who was directly involved with and had first hand knowledge of said issues, was a MAJOR no no and was deemed \"gossip\". But as long as you were management, it was open season on anybody and everybody as far as discussing not just departmental issues, but issues of a personal nature with people they did not like. A big part of this double standard and culture of extreme arrogance amongst management I believe stemmed from them considering themselves to have been personally blessed by Jesus himself to be raised to a position of authority. This caused an attitude of \"Do as I say; not as I do\", that could NOT be addressed by a subordinate. Dissent was rendered ABSOLUTELY intolerable. They consistently used fear tactics to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of a happy, kumbaya, Compassion International. If you had a problem, it was nobody's fault but your own. The Gallup survey, for example, was directly manipulated by management. When my department gave a low rating my team was pulled into a conference room and basically told why we were wrong and essentially the low ratings were our fault; not their's. We were passively reprimanded and told that the next Gallup survey should have improved answers and if not, \"Compassion isn't the company for you\". By far and large the management culture of Compassion will be their undoing. Which is a shame as so many genuine and passionate people work there but through scare tactics are rendered helpless to shed any light on major issues for fear of their livelihood. It is better to show up, stay under the radar, put on a face and act the way they want you to, and collect your paycheck.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend working for Compassion to anybody."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Would not recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Non-management workers here are for the most part very nice.

There are two groups at Compassion: Executives, and everyone else.  Almost to a person, the organization attracts smart, hard-working people who have a passion for helping impoverished children.  Most or all of the professional employees could be making more money elsewhere -- sometimes a lot more money -- but they choose to serve Christ and children at Compassion.  \r\n\r\nHow sad then that these people are not allowed to bring their passion, creativity or individual contributions -- the best part of themselves -- to work.  Their ideas are not wanted or appreciated.  It would appear that most executives feel \"I've heard from God himself, and I don't need or want to hear from anyone else.\"    When an employee does make a suggestion of merit, executives tell them \"no,\" then the executive will often \"have an idea\" a few months later, and implement it.  Curious how the idea is the same one that was shot down just a few months earlier.\r\n\r\nThey also do not like reports of \"bad news\" nor do they like people to identify risks.  Those who do are shut down quick through order, public humiliation, or both.\r\n\r\nOne group of employees had concerns about the quality of executive management, and was praying for their leaders (as told to do in the Bible) on their own time, and executives ordered them to stop immediately and not re-start the group, even on their own time or away from work.\r\n\r\nIt may seem hard for an outsider to believe, but employees do not feel comfortable saying anything at all negative in the building.  They will leave the building separately, meet for lunch off campus, and return separately.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, many employees struggle with emotional hurt.  Of these, some stay despite the feeling of working in a Soviet-bloc country, and the others have quit out of frustration, depression or anger.\r\n\r\nThis internal culture is widely known in the Colorado Springs area, and represents somewhat of a recruiting problem for Compassion -- whether they know it or not.\r\n\r\nWhile the president, Wess Stafford, is a nice guy, he's just not there enough to steer the organization back into a healthy internal culture, or has lost the internal political game with one or more of the other C-level executives who have seized power and control from Wess.\r\n\r\nThese problems seem to have started around the late 1990's, and according to their employees, contractors and consultants, persists to this day.\r\n\r\nFor people who want to be told what to do, how to do it, when to do it, etc., this may be an okay place to work.\r\n\r\nMore intelligent, educated, dynamic, engaged and creative people will suffer as a result."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Lost their way", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 May 2015", "job_title": " in Colorado Springs, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "On the field, Compassion does what it says.
