When various directors and VPs came to the PICU to answer our questions, they responded like politicians with no clear answers. While we were severely short-staffed, management turned some random corners of our unit into bed spaces. We added about 4 more bed-spaces without adding anymore nurses. The unit spent so much money paying overtime. It doesn't take a genius to figure out pediatric units across the county generally don't make money, and this is why unit budgets are so restrictive.  Inter-unit relations were also strained because of a lack of middle management (because there quite literally was no manager) When I worked there, senior level nursing leaders began to take the first steps towards achieving Magnet status. I knew the hospital had no chance of achieving this prestigious status based on my personal observations, and the grievances of my colleagues who worked in other adult & pediatric units.
