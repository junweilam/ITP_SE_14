Growth often requires change. This university doesn't like change. Thus, growth is hard to come by. There is a very strong \"good ol' boys\" club mentality here. There are some women in leadership, but I question how much they are able to actually \"lead\" with the current infrastructure.

The campus feels like it is in the middle of nowhere and students who stay on campus all week--mostly done by those who do not have cars--frequently experience bouts of depression around the start of Spring semester. The university claims financial health, but I think it acquires financial health, at least in part, by being cheap with its professors. My initial hiring salary was on the bottom of the large range of salaries acceptable for a beginning assistant professor, but I was promised I would quickly make up ground with significant annual raises. Once I started, I learned that the annual raises would not be significant. Our employee insurance plan is worse than the one I had as part-time employee graduate student. When I interviewed, I was also told that my department wanted my ideas on how they could grow into a larger department and maybe even a powerhouse within the state.
