And then, I would also get scolded for not asking for help. So it was always a lose-lose for me. You are also constantly micromanaged. My supervisor claimed that she did not micromanage even though she said that she \"knows what is going on at all times\" and felt that she had to talk to me once because she said I was gone from my computer for a long period of time when I was WFH. So after a while, my supervisor made it very clear that she did not want me there anymore, as she hinted that I should think about whether that job was for me or not. There was no hesitation on my end, as I had already realized that prior to the conversation and left as soon as I could. I left my previous job to come here because I had wanted to pursue a career in the education field and thought this would have been a way to get my foot in the door but in this case, the grass was not greener on the other side. I've decided to pursue a different career path and am happier now for it. This experience has definitely made me a better person and I am thankful for that, but I would never recommend anyone taking a chance here. You will not get paid well and you will not advance quickly in your career here.  The benefits also suck. Pursuing your education here is also a joke.
