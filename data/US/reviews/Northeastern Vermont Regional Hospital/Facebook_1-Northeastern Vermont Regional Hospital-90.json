From the CEO to the CNO to the managers of nearly all the departments, promotion has nothing to do with qualifications and almost entirely based on who you know and how long you\u2019ve been here. Management seems almost allergic to giving upper end jobs to people not already employed here. The CEO loves to talk about \u201cpromoting from within\u201d which is not a bad thing, but when they repeatedly overlook potentially really great people from outside for something they already know, it\u2019s the institution that suffers. New people bring in new ideas and this hospital has very little tolerance for anything that might change the status quo.\r\nAlso the CEO is pathologically obsessed with profit. The very first thing he did when Covid hit was ask everyone to take a 10% pay cut, including all the frontline workers putting their lives at risk by showing up to work. And he continued to support us by sending weekly financial updates from his home computer. Meanwhile we are some of the lowest paid nurses in the entire state. You get the idea.\r\nThe only time you see the CNO is passing by her eating her lunch in the cafeteria or if you go to her office. She is completely vacant to the nurses.\r\nA few horrible doctors that think nurses are morons and treat us as such."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Clinic Secretary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 May 2017", "job_title": "Clinical Secretary in Lyndonville, VT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have worked to NVRH Corner Medical for 17 years.
