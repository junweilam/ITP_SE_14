Vacant positions take forever to fill, and in the meantime, the understaffed office is expected to step in and absorb additional duties for 8-12 months (or more) with no extra pay. It seems that UNCW has taken the laid-back Wilmington \"beach vibe\" very literally, as there is no urgency to improve systems or retain good faculty/staff. It feels like the entire school is stuck in the 80's and committed to doing things \"they way they've always been done\" instead of progressing and looking to the future. In general, the campus has a very reactionary attitude, with a tendency to wait until things happen and then respond rather than trying to plan ahead and prevent problems. Some departments may be better than others, but this is my observation as a whole. Come to UNCW if you want to live in the beautiful city of Wimington, but expect to have your patience tested if you try to actually make any career progress at this school."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not the best place to work, not the worst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Police Officer in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay\r\nComp time\r\nPolos and BDUs", "cons": "When students aren't on campus, it's very boring\r\nNo consistency in expectations \r\nHow well you do is based on popularity"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Not bad", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Teaching Assistant in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Experience in education and solidification of concepts.", "cons": "Can be a little hectic."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good students", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Faculty in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Kind and engaged students, though not always the brightest.", "cons": "Low pay for adjunct profs"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great university in the south!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Academic Advisor in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of support, and excellent faculty and staff", "cons": "Educators in NC are not known for their big salaries"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Journalist in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "love it think it is great", "cons": "there are no cons i guess"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Nice place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Lecturer in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff are nice to work alongside.", "cons": "Money is not great for the work you perform."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Solid Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 May 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I worked within Campus Life, and I would say that my overall experience was good.

There WERE exceptions to this, but for the most part, felt like I didn't get what I paid for--and left with debt on top of it. While I thought the admins tried to listen to us and our concerns, I didn't really see them act on any of them, at least not in any long-term solutions way, and this ranges from unprofessional behavior to stuff I can't write out. I know many other students felt this way and had conversations with leaders, but ultimately, if nothing changes, does it matter that they listened? \r\n\r\nReally recommend that would-be GTAs at UNCW do some very realistic budgeting to figure out whether it's worth it. What you're getting paid will mean you'll have to take on other jobs to get through it, and even then, you will probably leave with debt unless you are coming in wealthy already. On top of that, what kind of job market are you entering? UNCW is also known for not hiring connected people. As in, if you've been a GTA, they're NOT going to hire you for a bigger/better position after you graduate--EVEN IF YOU ARE THE BEST CANDIDATE. Have seen this happen, so don't get looped in thinking you'll build a relationship with them and have any chance of staying on at your underpaid job after you graduate--you will not be given a pass to stay, at least not for long and, again, not for a wage you can live on without other jobs."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "A pleasant experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jul 2014", "job_title": "Lifeguard in Wilmington, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff is very understanding and laid back while still maintaining a very professional atmosphere.", "cons": "There is not alot of chances to progess into your field due to everyone at the school being in a very similar major.
