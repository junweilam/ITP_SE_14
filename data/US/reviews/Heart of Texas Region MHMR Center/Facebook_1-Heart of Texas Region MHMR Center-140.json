The staff are all so helpful, so kind, and treat you like family. I felt valued for the work I did. There is a nice team atmosphere. It's great to work in a place with so many services to meet the families' needs and to know I can trust the staff meeting those needs such as psychiatry, family partner and case management. My feedback to supervisors and management was welcome and they are open to input. They are flexible. I have had wonderful supervisors and the directors are very receptive, responsive, approachable, and understanding. I received high quality training at the expense of the company to make sure I could do my job effectively. It was not stressful and the expectations are reasonable. I had everything I needed to do my job effectively such as a fully supplied play therapy room to do Child Centered Play Therapy. The 401K benefits (one of the best matching rates out there 12%), health insurance, and life insurance are all great at no cost to me were all great! The workplace is very diverse and they are welcoming of staff and clients of all races, sexual orientations, gender identities, religions, national origin, disabilities you name it. They care about you as a person, not just an employee.", "cons": "The salary could be higher, but wasn't too unreasonable for the area and the benefits make up for it. I started at about $47,000 a year. They also just added incentive pay for reaching your billable hours and it's totally reasonable to attain. We got a new executive director in 2019 and he has been very receptive to employee input and has been working on increasing salary. They have already made a $5,000 salary adjustment for case managers. \r\n\r\nThe system for entering notes was quite tedious, but they had just switched to it and were still working on improving it.
