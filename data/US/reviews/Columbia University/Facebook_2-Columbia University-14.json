Low pay, stagnant salary raises. Salary raises are 1 to 2.5/3% and based on CORE values, which ironically the managers don't adhere to. To keep employee retention down, they eliminate positions when they fire someone or someone leaves. I definitely witnessed some unprofessional and immoral maybe illegal behavior. HR is a joke, go to the Ombuds office or leave if anything happens. Lots of politics, you won't always know why projects get scrapped or bad decisions made. There's a lot of scarcity mentality - upper management fighting over scraps and taking credit for rank and file work.  It's not uncommon to be yelled at by managers or other employees across the university. And if you go to HR, retaliation is a real possibility here.

Especially when they ship you off-campus into Harlem into what's basically a warehouse with long shared desks (no privacy and dangerous location across from train tracks, a gas station, and intersection). Not to mention the office is full of older folks who cough up phlegm and mucous all day. Gross. Good luck staying healthy. Likely in violation of several building codes (old dusty below-waist windows, giant lead door that swings open at any moment, could easily injure you). Meeting room was tiny and windowless, with no working equipment. Had to huddle around a tiny laptop in group meetings. Elevator service was shut down often as well, sometimes out of spite from the building workers. Co-workers routinely came into work sick as a dog. In fact, I was assigned to a desk where the ceiling had collapsed onto it. Then in the middle of the day, workers jack-hammered the roof directly above my head. I was told in an email, that work was going on that day and it \"wouldn't be very noisy.\" Even further, I was told it wasn't \"technically\" a jackhammer, but a different type of tool. Great. The work culture is a game of who can refuse to do work for the longest and continue to make new excuses every week. I was amused by this for about a day. It slowly became very depressing. My colleagues played this excuse-as-to-why-they-haven't-been-able-to-work game over and over and over every single week, without fail. It was enough to drive you completely insane. Eventually I just quit for my mental and physical health. If you work here, and want to learn new stuff, you can, but only to a certain point. Everyone is afraid of the real cutting-edge technology and it's seen as impossible to understand by these dinosaurs, which basically leaves you fully screwed once you leave if you try to get into the private sector. Co-workers were abusive and everything is extremely political and based on words in emails, not actions. If you're a master manipulator you might do well here. New management constantly, and hired from consulting firms. They also force you to complete the windowless basement brainwashing that is ITIL. If you point out the toxic culture to HR you will find yourself deeper and deeper into an inescapable position, because everything is based on words and no one wants to lose their job.

In my department the chair has a huge ego, bullies PIs and his trainees. His main talent lies in selling a lie like a slick salesman and amazingly he continues to recruit top notch postdoc and PIs. Our seminars are pointless because if anyone disagrees with the chair he just loudly and dismissively speaks over them. Past his prime, he simply does not understand some of the fundamental principles of the science in his department and he is too proud to realize what he doesn't know. Scientific growth is built from a collective knowledge of diverse experts and trainees and thrives through an open environment where people are not afraid to collaborate and learn. This does not happen here. The Chair is intimidated about what he doesn't know and overcompensates with a string of words that sound good but don't make sense and people let him get away with it, otherwise he will bully you into silence. \r\n\r\nIt is incredibly embarrassing especially with visiting speakers to hear him speak or ask questions because it is clear he is not even a layperson in his understanding of anything other than what he studied in the peak of his career. The feeling of overall frustration is pervasive. Postdocs are depressed disillusioned and under-compensated. Good PIs that come deal with the chair by either refusing to engage or by quietly disagreeing behind his back or by openly voicing their frustration in negative ways and they eventually leave for better run institutions. All in all while there are amazing PIs and postdocs within this department the leadership is bad and this permeates the overall culture of our department. \r\n\r\nCore resources are shockingly unorganized with the least amount of competent staff needed to support researchers. \r\nBuildings are not climate controlled and desperately run down.

Expect to lose all your benefits if you are awarded a fellowship. Don't expect bridge funding to cover you even if your R01 is renewed because there's no reserve to support your lab. \r\nPay is abominable for trainees and cumc housing and daycare are very expensive. \r\n\r\nAll in all you can do well here but it is an overwhelming challenge.
