If you are promised clinical supervision, negotiable pay, time off when needed, tuition reimbursement, and CAC courses paid for; these are lies. I did not realize I, as well as several others, were lied to until I was in orientation.  Facts were hidden that the facility had been shot at several times and bullet casings purposely set next to the door and found in the parking lot. The higher ups did not want her staff to know that other locations had security because then staff would want security.  There were no safety protocols in place to include how to deal with lice, silver fish, and bed bugs verified on the unit, as well as water pouring out of the ceiling due to busted pipes; to just name a few instances. You cannot get tuition reimbursement until after a year of working there but you are not informed of this until after you start. There is not a clinical social worker on site to provide supervision even though you will be told in your interview that there is. You can take all the time you want off, BUT you have to find your own coverage. There is not room for advancement. A co-worker's parent passed and was approved for bereavement days by HR but he was required find his own coverage. From January until March, seven employees quit and several others including shift coordinators were looking for new jobs, SEVEN!! When asked if the higher ups would help cover shifts when people started quitting, it was stated that they had more important priorities outside of work to take care of. This is a double standard since there was no regard for any of the line staff and their priorities outside of work. I was given a few days off after having major surgery but had to find my own coverage. The pay was set in stone regardless of your degree or experience, no negotiating was available like we was informed there would be in our interview.  The line staff have been yelled at on several occasions during supervision. Food is only given out until 8 p.m., after this the patients are supposed to drink water because the unit is not a hotel as stated by the higher ups. When bed bugs were found on the unit, the shift coordinators were informed by the higher ups to not let the line staff know. We were informed anyways thank goodness, in hopes to not transfer to our homes."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Best company I ever worked for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Wheat Ridge, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits, get a lot of time off, friendly and helpful employees.", "cons": "Management is out of touch"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "This company used to value what the staff thinks, but ever since the management changed, they don't.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Residential Counselor in Arvada, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lot of down time, easy to get overtime shifts.", "cons": "Schedule requires an overnight shift.
