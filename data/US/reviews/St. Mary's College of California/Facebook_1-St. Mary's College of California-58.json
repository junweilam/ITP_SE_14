Many of my coworkers, including myself, depend on the money we earn through ITS to pay for our rent, books, food, ect.

When the statewide minimum wage went up the summer of 2014, Saint Mary's increased their pay scale to agree with the new legal system. However, any student workers that had been on minimum wage before ($8) and had either earned a raise or who had nearly worked enough hours for a raise, lost all progress. Students that had been making $8.50 were now making $9, but so were those who were only making $8. I was now training workers, who would go on to train another generation of workers, with all of us making $9 an hour. For a two years I petitioned for a raise, and continued making minimum wage until I put in my two-weeks notice. I finally received a raise to $10.50 after working nearly three full years for Saint Mary's. One can only imagine the stress this put on me, trying to afford Bay Area housing costs and having to put my only job on the line to get a raise.\r\n\r\nIn summary: Saint Mary's College, especially IT Services, cares very little about you as a person if you are a student worker.
