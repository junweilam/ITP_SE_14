The project expanding the school at the main campus went so far over budget that cutbacks and layoffs are becoming an everyday occurrence. And rather than cutting down on the crazy number of $100k+ salaried executives and senior management staff that do nothing but add layers of bureaucracy and red tape that constantly ties the hands of progress, UMMS likes to start with the little people, cutting employees who, despite having been loyal to the organization for 10+ years at peanut salaries and offered no opportunity for advancement, stuck it out. Over the years, any opportunities for professional development have been cut completely. Tuition is not free for employees (50% off). Free courses offered previously (PMP certification, Lean Six Sigma training, etc.) have all been cut from the budget. Being promoted into a management position is not going to happen. Ever. Internal promotion of that nature is rare. HR is detached from staff and do nothing to facilitate internal growth - internal applicants are treated the same way as if the organization had never met them before and they hadn't put in years of service. Most upper management staff are subject matter experts - not people managers and most lack the skills to effectively manage staff. Despite knowing this, there is no management training provided to new managers (that was cut too). This is a dead end employer. If you want to punch a time clock, keep your head down, sit in a cubicle all day and are not interested in advancing your career (maybe you're biding your last few years until retirement?), then this is the place for you. If you're interested in building a career, move along. Employees are made to feel untrustworthy and completely replaceable - your opinion is not valued. The South Street building is filled with people who are miserable and totally dead inside. It's not pretty."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Buyer beware", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Worcester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work with some very bright people, dynamic environment with the opportunity to learn a lot of new technologies.", "cons": "IT group - Absolutely horrible management. - secretive, very little opportunity for advancement.
