They\u2019re best characterized by constant turnover, lack of support, lack of staff, lack of safety, and especially lack of concern for anything except the almighty dollar.  They totally lost the vision the original company had for valuing and providing peer support to those who are mentally ill and/or experiencing substance use issues. Now the emphasis is totally on admissions, turnover, and more admissions. No one in management cares about the experience of the patients or the safety or security of the staff anymore as they cut staff, increase patient numbers, and hire peers, QP\u2019s, RN\u2019s, and doctors who don\u2019t have a patient first commitment anymore. Sadly, the company has become the epitome of exploiting those who are mentally ill and/or have substance use issues for profit.
