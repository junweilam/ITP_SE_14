If you start as an SPA, don't expect to be promoted until you've  been there at least 1.5 years (2 yrs is more likely), regardless of your performance or the work you are actually doing. It is very common for Program Associates to be doing the work of a Program Officer, while being paid significantly less. Part of this comes with the territory of working in a non-profit organization where its all hands on deck all the time or funding may not be there at the time you are asking for a promotion. In actuality though, these reasons are used by Directors as an excuse not to promote people so they can keep salaries low in case the grant is overspent or there is a lack of funding down the line. Therefore, there is high staff turnover at significant cost to the institute. The pay is also abysmal unless you are an expat and receive post-diff and a housing allowance. IRI does not seem to  value compensating employees based on their contributions to the company. Also, annual increases are 3% for a job well done, up to 6% if they feel guilty about underpaying you so much to begin with. Almost no one is fired for poor performance (another huge issue).\r\n\r\nFinally, the work culture needs improvement.

My first post-college job was with IRI, and after what I thought was a decent experience I left for what I thought would be something better.  Very unstatisfied, I left that second job for a third.  Both paid more but neither measured up to IRI, so I asked to return to IRI and was welcomed back.

And a \"front office\" management that, while not sitting down each and every day with each employee, does care about our welfare.  Standards are high, but if you're very talented, you do get noticed, given additional outside training and promoted --to a point, see cons below; if someone obviously isn't making the grade, including occasionally at the director level, their departure is handled quietly and decently (again, unlike some other places I've worked).  Finally, I don't know many other non-profits that care enough to have a grad school tuition payback program, which obviously helps the company retain employees, but also is a great benefit to those carrying big debt; some of my colleagues are taking grad school at night, with allowances made by management, because of this program.

The pay is also a joke - I was paid 40% below my market value here after a promotion and \"salary realignment.\" The benefits no longer make up for this substantial gap - a meagre metro credit doesn't equal hard cash! HR is completely hands off and is forced to do rather unethical things by front office leadership.

Over the years, IRI has taken the needless bureaucracy to an astounding and ridiculous level causing many longtime employees to flee in frustration.  It is funny hearing the reactions of new hires who have come from other organizations because the bureaucratic hassles here are unparalleled in both volume and absurdity.  Consider yourself warned.\r\n\r\nOver the past almost decade, I have watched in horror as decision-making power has gradually been removed from program officers and replaced with elaborate approval processes for almost everything.  Even simple tasks such as counting how many international trips are available in your own program budget are now subject to higher level approvals!  This is mind-numbingly frustrating as you just can\u2019t get things done yourself - you must take multiple steps and often involve multiple people.  Between the approval processes and silly internal accounting procedures, be prepared to waste significant time printing hundreds of pages of unnecessary paperwork, filling out accounting forms and nagging the many people you are waiting on for approvals to move forward.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest deadweight here is the front office staff \u2013 who exhibit a pernicious need to have a say in all decisions and an alarming disregard for timeliness or honoring our commitments to partners.  Multiple bottlenecks in the approval process and a lack of urgency at the senior staff level means delayed payments, polls sometimes released months after the data was collected and an overall pall of uncertainty over programming.  Some recent front office decisions regarding how we treat contractors and local staff have been so shockingly inept, shortsighted and absolutely unacceptable to me as a person that I felt no choice but to leave.    \r\n\r\nI would advise anyone considering working here to be sure to read the reviews below - the descriptions of the cronyism, promotions based on front office whim instead of merit, and treating program staff like untrustworthy children are highly accurate.  This is not a way to attract or retain talent, and one of the plethora of reasons that many of the enthusiastic and gifted people I have worked with over the years have been driven away.
