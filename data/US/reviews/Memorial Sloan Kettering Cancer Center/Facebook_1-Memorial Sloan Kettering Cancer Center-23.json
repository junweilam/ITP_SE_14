This position is truly luck of the draw when it comes to the service you're placed in and the clinical team you work with. One person can be placed in an office with a low patient/call volume requiring little follow-up and minimal administrative responsibilities, while another has a much higher volume with continuous communication and active admin duties.\r\nThere is a lengthy training process in place to learn the systems; however, most of your learning will come within the first few weeks between mentorship and starting in your office. Job duties vary immensely between services so the training environment is the rose-colored glasses to the reality of what the day-to-day looks like as an OC.\r\nMost offices/clinical teams will consist of the physician, nurse, care coordinator (formerly SA), and office coordinator (formerly POA), but some will also include nurse practitioners, clinical research coordinators (formerly RSAs) and fellows. Depending on your service you may also be expected to actively interact with other services to follow-up on results or referrals.\r\nIn summary, there are a lot of moving parts and often the OC is the one keeping track of it all. As the overseer, if anything goes wrong, then the OC is the one who has to find the source of the problem, figure out a solution and implement it, all while keeping respective parties updated, whether that be an angry patient and his or her family, or a stressed out clinical team.\r\nThe OC job can be thankless and repetitive; however, you are expected to get through each day with the underlying desire to provide service to your patients and team. While in theory this is admirable, burn out happens quickly and there are little-to-no resources to provide assistance other than staying paid overtime to catch up and taking a vacation if you can find coverage. The caveat is that the coverage system is broken and leaves OCs feeling guilty for taking time off as it inevitably burdens a fellow OC to take on the extra workload.\r\nThere is very little upward mobility for OCs. You can go laterally and switch to CC to be in clinic or CRC to be involved in research, upward to a Team Lead (formerly POS) if you can manage to beat out the hundreds of other OCs and external applicants, internally to a different role which you will once again be in competition with other applicants, leave to go back to school, or put in your 2 weeks notice like many do (whether or not you have a new job lined up)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place but management is lacking", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Session Assistant II in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You work around leaders in the field of medicine / oncology so it's really an amazing experience if you are interested in learning more about medicine, science, research , new technology in the treatment of cancer is developed at MSKCC.\nAlso the patient care aspect is really rewarding, I learned a lot from my interactions with patients and I really enjoyed developing those relationships.", "cons": "Manager was dysfunctional and treated a few people in a weird manner.

The management doesn't know what the actual days of POAs look like and therefore try and have them do work that is physically impossible for one person. \r\n\r\nThe way that coverage and cross coverage is worked out - its extremely unbalanced and unfair (both within certain services and across different services). During my time there I was expected to cover SIX individual doctors offices on any given (regular) day in an extremely busy service. Other services are limited to two phone lines only and if both were in use the phone would go to voicemail, meanwhile there was NO LIMIT to how many phone lines my service had and was usual occurrence that more than one call would come in at the same time and there would be a constant flow of at least two people on hold at all times throughout the day (in a busy office) and we weren't allowed to have any unchecked voicemails throughout the day. Offices themselves and services overall are almost incomparable in workload, which is not fair to employees since all POAs have the same salary \"range\" and its not based on office or work done. you can be in a 1 MD office that is slow and make the same amount as someone who works for 3 separate MDs that are busy, which is extremely unfair to the employee working in the busy offices; especially when salary isn't great to begin with. \r\n\r\nAll POAs get the same (LENGTHY) training but depending on the office or service you are in the way things are done or what you actually have to do will differ. Training should be adjusted for specific services and more tailored to individual POAs (including those who will be covering for those POAs) so the training time can be cut down and you can get people in offices quicker and things could be done more efficiently. \r\n\r\nTo take off any days, you need to get another POA to agree to cover your office, which is asking a lot when all of your co workers are just as overworked and busy as you. \r\n\r\nThere is little to no room for growth within the actual POA path. POA I to POA II doesn't even count, since they give that to everyone. They say its based on performance but its basically given to anyone who makes it past probation and doesn't have any major complaints about them. From POA II to POA III is essentially useless and non existent, since you have to be there for years and years before you can even be considered and very few people ever make it that long. The only other jump that they offer is a specialist which is basically just managements puppy, who doesn't do anything to benefit POAs or help them, unless its to cover a prolonged absence. They also dont require specialists to be a POA before becoming a POS which is a complete joke since there are literally hundreds of POAs you could promote without going to outside departments or services (there were only about 4-6 specialists for the whole dept when I was there). \r\n\r\nThis is the theme for management overall, as upper management is very comfortable with things the way they are (majorly flawed but not their problem since they don't deal with the repercussions) and if anyone tries to change anything or do anything other than whats currently being done, they will never move up or get into a management role. They would rather take people from other institutions (who don't know the internal problems or have any internal experience) and have them follow a script and take over, than promote someone who actually knows where the problems are and what needs to be fixed and give them the power to do it. Management lacks talent because all the smart people leave after seeing the politics and resistance to change in a department with such deep rooted issues. \r\n\r\nThere is an unbelievable turn over rate, that management chalks up to this being an entry level job and make excuses about people leaving to go to school or what not, but most of the time that is not true and people are only leaving because they are so miserable there. Within six months of being there you'll be one of the most senior people on the team. \r\n\r\nEven though the POA is absolutely essential to the running of the office and making sure things so smoothly, there is little to no respect from the clinic side (depending on the MD and nurse). POAs are the first to be blamed for everything and the first to be asked to fix everything, regardless of who originally messed something up. There is serious disconnect between the offices and the clinics and SAs and POAs. They paint a picture that everyone works together but on a day to day basis, its just people pushing responsibilities on different people, with responsibility usually falling back on the POA, no matter what even if it is someone else's responsibility. \r\n\r\nAs negative as this review is, this job will challenge you and test you and teach you a lot about yourself (if you can survive long enough) but it is definitely not for everyone."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Low work-life balance", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Office Coordinator in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There is dedication to providing patient care in a timely manner; they care about the patients.", "cons": "A very large workload; you will often need to ask for help to manage the office, which can be troublesome to other coworkers during busy periods.

Great patient care, world-renowned research, and a seemingly inclusive environment which lead to long careers here. Remember that this is a glossy place and looks great on resumes/CVs. This veneer starts with the orientation. MSK's orientation is the best as it is welcoming and claims to value all employees. I have worked in several NYC hospital systems, and this orientation is a show-stopper.  However, orientation is nothing like what working here is on a daily basis - they want you to believe this is a supportive environment in which innovation, growth, and passion are valued. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nI am going to break this down by subject:\n\nFaculty and management - Faculty are deeply out of touch with everyone who actually does the work; this manifests as authoritative and demeaning behavior, operation behind smoke and mirrors regarding grant budgets for which they are the PIs, and a culture built on microaggressions. Moreover, management is petty. They gossip relentlessly, tread around discrimination issues (both LGBT and race), deliberately leave key front-line staff out of the discussions, take credit for lower employees' work, and hide behind many levels of this so-called success framework. Take a look at the morale among front-line staff - it's low. You have a revolving door they attribute to people getting their education, moving, other opportunities. No, the faculty and managers are awful. People leave toxic work environments not because of the work.\n\nRacism - MSK hires POC to fill a quota. This is me and everyone other POC working here. Case in point: I was actually told by faculty that the normal MSK patient is white, upper middle class and has a nuclear family when I questioned the lack of representation of POC/LGBT/different socioeconomic statuses for patients within the area I worked in. This faculty member continued by saying that adding POC and LGBT patients into this project was \"too complex\" and that \"disadvantaged patients\" were a hindrance to this particular project. When I brought this to HR, nothing was done. No slap on the wrist for this faculty member. Nothing. This was one of many experiences I had here - yes I documented all of them.\n\nHowever, white employees get away with being outspoken and unruly. The level of favoritism for white employees is astounding. Take a look at who lasts the longest here, gets promoted, and whose ideas become research, influence clinical care, and are generally taken seriously. \n\nHomophobia and transphobia - Being a white gay man or woman here seems to be a good thing for the most part. Just enough diversity to be safe. However, if you are a queer person of color, a transgender person, or a non-binary person, stay away. It does not matter that there are employee resource groups at MSK, you do not work with those from the group in daily context. You will find yourself alone and dealing with constant ignorant comments or questions (at the most well-meaning of intentions) all the way up to outright discriminatory statements. MSK is way behind and a damaging place to work for LGBTQ people.\n\nIssues with job descriptions and scope of work - beware of job descriptions that are not truly what they are. While job seekers can never truly have a whole picture until you are actually at your desk in the day to day, it is important to ask exacting questions here as this seems to be a pervasive issue. Ask to speak to others on your potential team about their experiences not just the people you are interviewing with, ask for examples of projects and daily work to make your decisions if you can deal with the racism and homophobia and transphobia.\n\nMany people at MSK have never worked in other environments, and it shows. They drink this Koolaid like they have been in a desert for the past week.  \n\nBottom line: \n\nWhite people will do well here. Come here if you only care about your salary and benefits. But be prepared to be belittled, experience racism, homophobia, transphobia, and have little opportunities for advancement.\n\nProtect your mental health and dignity if you are a Person of Color or an LGBTQ person. There are plenty of jobs out there in research and program management in much healthier environments."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Comfortable place to cut your teeth", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Bioinformatics Technician in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "For a tech it's a pretty low-stress position and you learn a lot in the first year or two.

If you are trying to go to graduate school for anything not related to healthcare, they will not pay for these classes. I've seen most people get into this role for the tuition reimbursement (which is ~$12,000 per calendar year) so I wanted to put this information out here incase that is your primary motivation.", "cons": "I started with the \"cons\" list because it was honestly very hard for me to think of  \"pros\" for this role at MSK. First of all, this role has a HIGH turnover rate. Of the cohort that I came in with at my department, I've seen more than half quit before a year was even up. Even when I first stated in the department, the employees at the time had told us that we were hired to replace the former employees who had quit. It should've been a huge red flag for me at the time but I don't think I understood the severity of high turnover rates and how that directly indicates poor management and poor work environment and culture. Also, let me be clear - most people are NOT fired from this role. Most people QUIT voluntarily because it is that bad. That's why you'll see MSK recruiting for this role all the time. \r\n\r\nThis position is not as advertised. As of March 2018, they increased the average salary for a Physician Office Assistant from $43,000 to $48,000 to adjust for market inflation.  If you look at a quick review on Glassdoors, the typical Physician Office Assistant in NYC salary is way above that (around $59,000; with a moderate rate closer to $51,000). Now, the reason I'm mentioning this is because I want to let you know what you'd be paid for so that you can consider if this is worth your time.  \r\n\r\nIn this role, you are expected to be the office manager for the doctor or clinician that you work for and you are not even remotely compensated for it. You will be overworked with having to cover multiple offices at once and even though they say overtime is not expected, you'll find yourself putting in a lot of overtime hours just so you're not drowning in work the next day. While the doctors you'll work for are sympathetic that you are often inundated with work, they only care about whether the work is done. You will work for a doctor but you will be managed by a supervisor in the administration of the hospital for your department. Most of the time your supervisor will not understand your workload and even if you explained to them the high volume, they won't understand or believe you. I've been asked in these situations how I can change my own working style/\"work flow\" instead of being offered help/support by administration. \r\n\r\nI've worked in 3 different services during my time here and I can tell you that the majority of the services at MSK are very very busy with minimal support staff - which means a lot of the work will fall on you. You can expect to talk to 60+ different patients daily, along with answering voicemails, online patient messages, and processing other documents related to smooth office functioning. In addition, you will be asked to act as the administrative secretary for the doctor you're working for - which means planning domestic/international air travel/hotel, planning meetings, submitting for reimbursement & travel authorizations, and renewing licenses to medical associations (pretty much also acting as a personal assistant).\r\n\r\nThey are NOT flexible with time off requests. So, if you want a work-life balance, have a family or are going to school, this is NOT the job for you. MSK has a customer service initiative to their patients that if they call during business hours (9am - 5pm), the patient will be able to get in contact with a live person (usually YOU) and if they leave a voicemail, the office will call them back same-day. This would make sense if each doctor had a staff to work on triaging patient's messages but they don't. Instead, they have 1 or 2 Physician Office Assistants working for them and consistently triaging phone calls/messages throughout the day. As a result, if you want to take time off for a doctor's visit/family event/emergency, you have to find someone in your service to answer your phonecalls/messages for you. Management does not help with this coverage and will ask you first to find someone to cover you and if you can't, then they will reach out to someone. The problem with this is that most of your co-workers are very busy and they simply cannot take on someone's workload, and this creates strife among employees. \r\n\r\nThere is a workplace culture of blaming and pointing fingers. There were often situations when something was missed for a patient and instead of working together to solve the problem, you'll find that your teammates (your nurse and session assistant mostly) will want to make themselves look good for the doctor and as a result, throw you under the bus. You have to understand that with this role, you are constantly working together with a team (a doctor, nurse(s) and a session assistant from clinic) and you're work is interdependent. So, to me it doesn't make sense why the culture is not more geared toward an outlook of \"let's learn from each other so that we can work better together\" and more towards \"this person made a mistake, let's highlight that and also not explain what went wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThis alluring aspect of MSK is that it \"looks good\" on paper, their resume is pristine. It is a \"prestigious\" hospital in NYC and internationally too, with good benefits and opportunities to move up ...or so it seems.  But in reality, there are a lot of honest, hardworking people at this hospital who are being overworked, not rewarded/compensated appropriately and not developed.  This role is an entry level role and yet, I've seen some people in this role (although it is very rare) that have been here for 10 -15 years because they believe in MSK and yet they haven't moved up anywhere...that's not right. Why aren't employees that have been with MSK in this role groomed for leadership roles when they are the \"eyes\" and \"ears\" of the hospital - literally the frontline men and women?

I used to really love working at MSK, and found the clinical research infrastructure to be robust and supportive. Sure, we still had frustrations with the regulatory committees, and there was more red tape than anyone wanted to deal with, but that occurs pretty much anywhere you go in academic medicine.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, over the past 18-24 months multiple major changes were rolled out (and continue to be rolled out), and adaptation has been pretty disastrous. I went from really enjoying my job to dreading each day that I had to go in. Morale plummeted, and 6-8 months ago, things seemed to get exponentially worse (with the  next phase of changes). Clinical research staff are overworked at all levels, leadership does not consider anyone from middle management down (PMs and up are not counted here), inequity is significant for the same role across different departments. The changes have been forceful and everyone seems at best impatient and at worst angry\u2026all the time.\r\n\r\nLeadership is secretive and defensive about major changes, and once changes are rolled out (with barely any notice, no guidance, and no support for delivering news to your teams), there appears to be an unspoken zero-tolerance policy for anything other than purely positive feedback. If you have any concerns about the changes\u2013 not even negative feedback, just a question or suggestion \u2013 you risk being \u201cblacklisted.\u201d\r\n\r\nI know this sounds ridiculous, but I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. I watched colleagues that I really respected belittled in meetings and over email. I also watched people I respected, and whom I saw as collaborative and effective get blocked from promotions and other advancement opportunities because they were \u201ctoo negative.\u201d These are people who no one previously considered to be negative.\r\n\r\nBefore I left, I saw a lot of really talented people that I admired a great deal (those who were \u2018blacklisted\u2019 and others \u2013 not everyone spoke up) leave, and it seems like they are weeding out all of the talent that MSK is so proud to attract, and leaving mediocre but self-important people to run the show.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think I realized how unhealthy this environment was and how truly miserable it made me until I finally left, and noticed how much happier I became at my new institution. I was so saddened to see a place I truly loved and respected as much as I did MSK, become such an ugly, cliquey, almost tyrannical place.\r\n \r\nI want to mention that the clinical faculty and staff, and other research admin staff, supervisors and managers were some of the finest colleagues I have ever had, and I miss them very much. I really hope that the clinical research administration at MSK is just going through some serious growing pains, and that it will one day be a good place to work in clinical research again. If you are looking at this 2-3 years from the review date, then look at more recent reviews from people in clinical research. If those are positive, hopefully it means things have improved.\r\n\r\nIf this review is still very recent\u2026well, this review represents just one person\u2019s experience/perception, but if you\u2019re set on working in clinical research at MSK, then go in with your eyes wide open.

I am writing this review to hopefully give potential candidates some insight on my experience.  If you've never worked for a non-profit or hospital before, please ask a lot of questions, meet your team and get everything in writing before you accept an offer from MSK.  The culture isn't at all what was presented at orientation.  Management is not adaptable to change, expectations of your role/responsibilities are not defined. There is lack of communication, people are protective almost resulting in a competitive work environment.  If you ask questions, they're not welcome, which inhibits your ability to learn the current processes. Any issues which are escalated are questioned and MSK policies are not applicable to all employees.  As an outsider, I have never encountered such practices, culture and negativity.  Favoritism exists and employees are granted benefits based on seniority and your personal relationship with leadership.  The culture is to sit at your desk from 9-5pm, little collaboration and no one smiles, says hello or makes you feel welcome.  Not sure if it's the nature of the work but having worked at similar organizations, the end goal should be productivity and providing new employees with the resources to succeed.  I am starting to believe it may vary by department but if you're considering clinical research, you have been warned.  \r\n\r\nTheir definition of flexibility is very different than the industry or other organizations.  Be ready to encounter a hazing period when you first start.  Exempt employees are treated as hourly employees. You're not given autonomy or the decision making ability for your own team.  Most of the employees have  only worked at MSK and probably wouldn't survive elsewhere considering the professionalism required and expected at other organizations.  I didn't get a good feeling my first day and each week it became even harder to see a future with the organization.

It becomes very uncomfortable to vocalize concerns as they are always swept under the rug. The behavior of some management members comes across as sabotaging and revenge. There are also incidents of lying on workers. Certain race groups do not receive any backlash for their actions in the work place such as using their phones, being disrespectful to patients, leaving their workstation multiple times throughout the day while others receive it for minor incidents. This has caused many to quit which also becomes a burden on the remaining staff as the workflow increases creating a burnout.

The retention rate is horrible due to these factors.
