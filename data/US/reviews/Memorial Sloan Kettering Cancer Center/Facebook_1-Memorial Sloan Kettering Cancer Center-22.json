Of course upper management wants as much done as efficiently as possible, but my fellow coworkers didn't want to do things that they didn't have to do all at once, they like to spread their work out so they could stay busy, in my case I like to finish all my duties within the first 2 hours in the morning so by midday I was sweeping my office for the next 4 hours straight because I had nothing to do and it looked like I was just lazy sitting in the office doing nothing. I would intentionally let stuff I knew could get backed up, back up a bit so I could have a full day, but my boss saw that as a mess in me not doing my duties but when I did too much there was nothing for me to do and I would get the talk by my coworkers to not work too hard because then they'll always expect it. It was just a bad situation for me and it seems like everybody that winds up leaving there has a similar story. I have nothing against the people that work there, I just wish people were more honest with what they wanted and assured you that if you do the job the way I want you to do it you'll never have to worry about your job instead of me worrying if I work too hard my coworkers will hate me and plot against me but if I work too little upper management will get rid of me, they gave me crazy anxiety."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Pay Transparency", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Assistant to Chair in Okhla", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The healthcare benefits are the only pros", "cons": "Eyes and ears open and mouth shut will get you far."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Top notch compensation", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Staff RN in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A great place to work after you\u2019ve gotten your years of experience else where, unless you want to finish your nursing career here.

The staff is cliquey, mainly because for the most part they try to only hire friends of current employees (at least within nursing). The nursing staff for the most part it very young and inexperienced. They're good nurses for the specific type of cancer they trained on just overall inexperienced. Each floor is a different cancer and since they don't float it's unlikely they will get experience in anything that doesn't pertain their \"their patients\". They mainly only hire new grads so they are easy to mold but this means that they are extremely set in their ways. As a former traveler I found it hard to assimilate and after 2.5 years I still seem to have trouble as they are so different from every other hospital.

I unfortunately was assigned a very unhelpful and unfriendly supervisor and this greatly undermined my success in this company. A lot of the CRC's complain about how unhappy they are, the workload is high, there is little to no training when assigned protocols, but management expects you to know everything about the protocol. My supervisor whose role is suppose to be support and guidance, was very mean and unfriendly towards me and when I asked for guidance I was often met with a condescending attitude. What hurt me the most was that I proactively tried to address this issue with upper management on multiple occasions and this led to my termination with no explanation."}]]
