Management is dishonest, over worked, stressed, and unapproachable.  This reflects on the entire floor and the visibly stressed manager takes it out on employees.  Team work is nonexistent due to high acuity, no CNAs and a heavy patient workload.  Management talks down to nurses, uses scare tactics, and has openly shared confidential health issues regarding other employees. New grad nurses are being placed in charge nurse positions with little floor experience.  We are given only two weeks notice for mandatory staff meetings and in-services which are often rescheduled at the last minute.   My schedule is also changed often which makes it hard to schedule personal appointments or family time on my days off.  Raises are minimal and not considerate of the hard work and commitment involved.  Reviews are negative with no positive feedback which has caused a general sense of unappreciation overall.  The so-called \"competitive\" health benefits deny coverage of ALL medical claims, lab work, etc including a general doctor\u2019s visits for basic health conditions.  I have spent hours on the phone on days off with UMR/LHP Benefit Share Plan trying to resolve unpaid claims.  In my personal opinion all of the above is not worth the career risk, stress, or heartache.
