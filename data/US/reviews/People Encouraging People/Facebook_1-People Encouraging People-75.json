They often hire former clients on as staff. They provide great opportunities to people from all walks of life. Especially immigrants from Nigeria, where the CEO has a special interest. If you want to make a difference, this is the place to be.", "cons": "No interaction with management. Since COVID, a 2 hour daily phone call replaced all active management. Most front line staff would not know who their director is, or the C-suite, if they saw them on the street. You can do your own thing with very little oversight, which works great for some and not so well for others. There is little to no active management of regular staff. Edicts are sent out by email, and during COVID morale has been low as staff left and were not replaced. This is the email sent in the depths of COVID, 4/26/2020, while licensed staff were the only ones doing all of the billable services for the company as Maryland did not permit billing for telehealth services by non-clinical staff. \r\n\r\nWe have been providing telehealth services for four weeks. Since it began, it has always been required that the licensed staff make calls and/ or videos to provide clinical services, assess consumer needs and for billing purposes. We have worked very hard to keep staff and consumers safe, in part, by allowing these services to be delivered remotely by professional staff. We have also worked hard to assure that we maintain everyone\u2019s employment. \r\n\r\n\r\nConsistently, the data shows that the professional staff make the fewest calls and have the most attempts. The majority are also not making home visits. \r\n\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, an email was sent asking for phone records as they are required by Executive Order from the Governor\u2019s office to demonstrate compliance and justify Medicaid revenues. This request was met with resistance and a lack of cooperation. It is unthinkable that our most senior clinical staff do not comply with directives and, instead, create barriers to providing services to our consumers who need so much, yet ask for so little. There appears to be few attempts at creative problem solving. This behavior is reprehensible especially during a crisis such as this, when so many others in our communities are sacrificing and suffering. It is shameful. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore effective Monday April 27th, all licensed professionals, including program managers, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, therapists and substance abuse counselors will report to the office. You are required to be there from 8:30 am until 5:00 pm making phone/video calls and fulfilling all other regular duties. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7 You will participate in your team meeting beginning at 8:45. am. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 No consumer is to be called before 10:00 am unless they have agreed to such. You will make calls between 10:00-2:00. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 Any consumer that you were unable to reach will be visited by you at their home beginning at 2:00. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 You will knock at the door and wait for a response at minimum of ten feet from it. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 If there continues to be no response, consult with the team about whether or not a wellness check is required. \r\n\r\n\u00b7 You will return to the office and work until 5:00 pm. All documentation is to be submitted before the end of the day. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone who is not reached during regular working hours shall be contacted during the evening or on weekends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen working in the office you must adhere to the guidelines set forth in the memo from Dale Meyer, CEO last week. Staff should spread out and use different offices to maintain a healthy distance and use office telephones to complete visits. Face covering shall be used in shared offices or in common areas. All staff will receive cloth masks by Tuesday. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is non-negotiable; this allows us to assure the privacy of your phone records. Calls made in the last four weeks still require records. Staff concerned about privacy should black out calls on their phone record that were not made to PEP consumers. Staff with pre-paid phones or using Google voice should screenshot their call logs and submit those. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegarding Google calls, I am certain that many of you choose not to answer phone calls with numbers you do not know. Imagine if you were paranoid, anxious, or a victim domestic violence and you receive numerous phone calls from random numbers. Do you think you\u2019d be more prone to answer these calls? Again, during a uniquely challenging and frightening time, especially for our disabled and disadvantaged consumers, it would appear that your need for personal comfort (under the guise of boundaries) far exceeds the obligation to assure the health and well-being of our consumers."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Difficult", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Therapist in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The clients, the team, work", "cons": "The mercurial management that doesn't care about employees"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good experience but poor management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Housing Specialist in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great experience for case management and for helping people.
