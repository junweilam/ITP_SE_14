Recently the University has been more flexible with allowing remote work for employees who do not have forward facing positions, i.e. those whose work is done behind a computer screen and have little to no face to face interactions in order to effectively do their job are given some flexibility to work remotely. It should be noted that this depends on ones department, supervisor, and performance. This is a huge benefit and I sincerely hope the University continues to allow this flexibility for it's employees. There are opportunities to move around within the University if you are interested in doing so. There are many job opportunities here and often times, supervisors are supportive of internal movement to other positions.", "cons": "It is very difficult to receive merit based salary increases, so it is very important to negotiate a salary you are very comfortable with before you accept your position. Unless you receive the opportunity to significantly increase your responsibilities in your current position, or change your position entirely, it has proved difficult to negotiate any increase outside of state/union-wide increases, which have been around half a percentage point over the past few years (>0.5%). Unfortunately, this inability to provide even moderate raises for performing well (again, outside of state/union allocations) or giving consideration for cost of living increases, can be very discouraging if you hope to increase your income while remaining in the same position for any length of time. However, as mentioned in the pros, the benefits are excellent and help to slightly off-set this potential downside."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It's okay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Teaching Assistant in Vestal, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get a stipend and tuition scholarship.

Staff are hired into SL levels and can be transferred, against their will, to any position on campus as long as it is in the same SL level. I was \u201creassigned\u201d from admissions, where I had 5 years of experience, to operations, where I was put in charge of the Graduate School\u2019s giant budget. I had no experience with budgets on this scale and I didn\u2019t apply for this posting when it became available because I wasn\u2019t interested or qualified. HR wouldn\u2019t do anything and neither would the union. I applied for other jobs on campus that I was qualified for within academic affairs but all of these supervisors rolled up to Provost Nieman and I wasn\u2019t able to move within the campus community. So I left Binghamton University as soon as I secured a better position. Which was incredibly disappointing because Binghamton had become my home - I graduated there twice, I met my husband there, all of our friends were in the area. But the internal politics and bureaucracy were unbearable. That\u2019s not even considering the bullying inside the Graduate School office where I was yelled at by a coworker, in front of our boss, that I wasn\u2019t even wanted there as an employee so I could just leave. The supervisor did nothing and the coworker, who has a reputation for being extremely difficult to work with, continued to create a hostile environment that I was hesitant to report due to fear of retaliation. I was in a situation set up to fail and couldn\u2019t leave fast enough!

If you want a partial history, google \"The Kaye Report\" and be astounded by the conduct described. Now consider that what the report describes as conduct in one department was going on across the entire campus in different ways depending upon the department and circumstances. Those that complained were harmed further. Those who filed grievances were denied due process. It was a systemic problem-top down. It was horrible for those that tried to follow ethical guidelines, for those with a moral compass and for those who complained or filed grievances. But, there was pretty much a clean sweep of the administration so things may may be looking up. If you are considering a job on campus, ask the hard questions. What is the morale? How do those at the top and bottom feel about the department, school or office. Ask to talk with those who are noticeably absent from your interview schedule. In the past, those unhappy were marginalized and described in harmful ways in an attempt to devalue and degrade what they had to say. Be aware of that past and dig beneath the surface.
