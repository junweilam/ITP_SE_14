Definitely an every man for themselves kind of environment. \n\nManagement is disorganized: the nurse educators in the dept seem to be disorganized. The way they set up orientation, sign offs skills, scheduling was always a mess. They need more structure on how they orient newly hired nurses.\n\nNurse-physician culture/teamwork: Disconnected. Nurses and providers barely communicate w/ each other unless the patient needs something or is in a critical state. \n\nToo much emphasis on competition with Yale.
