Senior leaders have a history of not listening to recommendations from their front-line / operational management staff who are doing the work on a daily basis. When recommendations are provided, the response is usually, \"Thank you for your feedback, however, we are going a different direction.\" The different direction is usually a recommendation that was already implemented by a previous leadership team and did not work. Also, why hire external consultants in your area, when you already have senior staff who are fully capable of implementing positive changes internally? If you empower your staff to speak up and listen to these recommendations, the organization would be further along in our journey to be top 5 in the nation vs where we are currently.\r\n\r\nAll of this can be fixed. I have been here for many years and still believe in the potential of our organization.

They talk down to them & make hurtful, rude, and demeaning comments towards their employees. This is even tolerated in staff huddles and meetings. I complained multiple times after hearing management make foul, and at times even racist comments, but the managers engaging in this behavior were somehow able to keep their positions. It was very sad to see how they treated some of the staff. \r\n- Favoritism given to employees who are related to directors or other managers. These employees receive multiple career advancement opportunities not offered to others, higher pay, & are promoted with ease.\r\n- Directors only care about saving money to increase their bonuses. They don\u2019t care about the staff. They fire senior employees because they can hire new staff for a cheaper cost or promote someone into a role while having them maintain their previous position. So it\u2019s not really a promotion. It\u2019s way more work added on to your already full plate for a few dollars more an hour.

There is no standardization to onboarding and you are largely left to figure things out for yourself or rely on the kindness of people who have been in your position to take pity on you and help. \r\n \r\nOverall, leadership, from the C-Suite to the Director level, is wholly out of touch with their employees and what they do and will do absolutely nothing to advocate for your well-being let alone even seeming to care about their job or the people around them at all. \r\n\r\nCareer Advancement and Compensation: \r\nCompetence and ingenuity are not rewarded with raises or promotions unless you are loud enough and aggressive enough to claw your way up to what you deserve. Instead, people with those qualities are rewarded for doing good work by being given more work. Employees who do well will regularly outperform their job duties on paper for 10's of thousands of dollars less than they should be receiving for doing so. \r\n\r\nCareer advancement is stymied by nonsense career ladder processes. Management knows who they will/will not give positions to prior to career ladder applications/interviews (leaders often tell employees whether or not they should even apply for a desired position based on whether they know they will get it or not) but they still make existing employees jump through hoops during a 6 month long process to receive a single step promotion on an unnecessarily long ladder and a 5% pay increase. \r\n\r\nDiversity: \r\nSHC puts on a very good, but VERY fake face when it comes to diversity. The C-Suite is largely full of old white men and it shows in the way that the company operates. SHC is stuck in the dark ages in so many ways. Almost all efforts to promote diversity in the workforce and to support employees of color are completely empty \"check a box\" type of actions. The culture of the company is such that the retention of a diverse workforce is nearly impossible, because SHC has set up an environment in which only people who fit into the \"cultural majority\" are rewarded. At the very least there need to be BIPOC in positions of leadership in every department, and in the higher levels of leadership such as the C-Suite. Every employee should be required to complete an implicit biases training, and all hiring processes should be overhauled and standardized across the organization to control for biases. \r\n\r\nAlso, diversity of opinion and questioning leadership are big no-no's and will lead to being covertly or overtly treated differently than colleagues who blindly follow leadership's nonsense."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Radiologist in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic work environment.

I have to trade my shifts with other employees to make up for poor schedule.\r\n- Pay for Registered Nurses 50-60% less than in a hospital (even as a new grad). And this is while living in the most expensive area in the country.\r\n- Because of poor pay need the 2nd job but unable to hold one because the schedule is EXTREMELY unpredictable and changes all the time (example of week 1: Monday 7:30a-2:45p, Tuesday 12p-8:30p, Wednesday 5:45a-3p, Thursday/Friday - off, Saturday 10a-5p, Sunday 8:15a-2:30p; the next week days off are on Monday and Sunday, the week after off on Tuesday and Sunday and so on). \r\n- Schedule is given 4 weeks in advance but subject to change and changes often to cover sick calls and busy operations.\r\n- Hard to schedule doctor's appointments, kids' activities because of schedule. One time I rescheduled my doctor's appointment 5 times to accommodate my ever-changing schedule.\r\n- Most employees work >75% of weekend days.  \r\n- Very high turnover rate. Out of 50-55 collections department employees (phlebotomists and RNs who draw blood from donors) >15 left in the last 14 months.\r\n- Management doesn't focus on retention of employees but on how to hire more. They hire 3 times a year 4 or more people each time.\r\n- Training department had to expand (hired 2 full-time trainers in the last 12 months to a total of 5 trainers) to keep up with training of new employees because they cannot train fast enough due to employees leaving too soon  \r\n- Vacation request has to be done by December 15 of previous year for summer months of next year. If not requested so early ahead, there is no guarantee that even one vacation day off will be granted in the summer. Even for other months it's tedious to request vacation and is still not guaranteed. Management says that \"we're open to work with you\" but the outcome often doesn't reflect the statement.\r\n- Many accrued sick hours available but it's frowned upon when one calls in sick. If it's done on Saturday, Sunday, or Monday, then management can reprimand for sick calls creating \"a pattern\", which can be reflected in performance review. \r\n- Being on-call on weekends pays ZERO to be ready at 6-7am on a day off. If they call, then the pay is the same as on weekdays unless one already worked 40hrs this week. In this case pay is 50% for being overtime, no other additional pay for being on-call. If they don't call, then one gets paid nothing, hence not many employees want to be on-call and weekend work days become that much more hectic to work due to understaffing.\r\n- No differential for late and weekend shifts.\r\n- Chronic understaffing. Example: a 3-staff small bus was sent to a company that scheduled 27 donor appointments in 4 hours.
