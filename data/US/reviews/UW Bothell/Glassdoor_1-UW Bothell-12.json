Strong nepotism allows inept Vice Chancellors to be hired in lieu of incredibly talented pool of candidates from outside. Rest of the supporting staff is treated with zero respect and regard. No accountability for bad behaviors. HR team is a joke and only stand by who pay their checks. Young, inexperienced get promoted which affects student recruitment & retention = worsening budget restraints. Telework agreements are a joke as Yeigh makes it clear that all must work in the office in the middle of a pandemic which shows no sign of improvement. If you want to work for an employer who shows you respect, empathy and integrity, apply elsewhere. The upper management backpaddles on their promises and constantly breaks them."
