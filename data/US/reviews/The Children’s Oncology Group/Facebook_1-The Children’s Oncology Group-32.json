Management does not care about their employees wellbeing at all, and treats employees as easily replaceable, although they also can\u2019t ever find enough employees to work here. You will be expected to keep up with an excessive workload because of the continual turnover, and management will not help or support you in any way. There is quite literally no room for advancement in this company. They would rather leave management positions empty for almost 2 years rather than internally hire any of their current employees. All managers are externally hired because there is no trust in or mentoring of the current employees. The work environment can only be described as constant chaos, because some employees are given a huge workload while other employees just sit around gossiping and bad mouthing others all day. Don\u2019t expect your coworkers to support you either, in fact, expect them to throw you under the bus at any moment because of the every man for himself attitude that the company encourages. If you enjoy working in an extremely toxic environment, being treated like you don\u2019t matter at all despite your frantic efforts to keep up with the unsustainable workload, and being degraded by your coworkers, HR, your supervisors, and upper management, then this is the place for you. If you expect a professional work environment free of childish coworkers gossiping and causing drama; to be trained and supported by any of your managers, or to leave work for the day feeling anything other exhausted, frustrated and beaten down, then definitely don\u2019t work here. This company has been the worst place I\u2019ve ever worked, which is sad considering that the point of the organization is to help children with cancer, but that goal is clearly second to stroking the manager\u2019s egos. Working here will mostly just take a toll on your mental health and self-esteem until you find another job, like the majority of the hardworking employees here do. Don\u2019t waste your time, health or humanity working for a company that makes it very clear that they couldn\u2019t care less about you as a human being."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The Toxic Work Environment Starts from the Top", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Monrovia, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay, and a worthwhile mission working at the forefront of medicine.

Within weeks of starting in a managerial position, she will rope you in and try to talk badly about every person in the organization. She brags about how people think she is a sociopath. She will go from friend to enemy within a few seconds. She vocally advocates for her directors to manager through fear, and has given direction that we should not be friendly to reports or they will not \"respect\" us. She requires complete control of staff, and turns the directors under her manager into dictators that are terrified to disappoint her. She has specific vendettas and as structural changes occurred that put more personnel under her purview, she purposefully purged those who had work there for years but were on her bad side. I have never been in such a toxic work environment in my whole life. \r\n\r\nA large reason why this is such an insular, toxic place is because the federal funding structure perpetuates systems that are complex and take years to learn. Additionally, at COG we work with the brightest minds in medicine, i.e. with academic, medical leaders in pediatric oncology. This is a highly specialized, high-stress branch of medicine. This means that the doctors we work with have extreme personalities, including the medical director. This also means that despite the fact that not one of them works on site or has any background in human resources, their moods and directions dictate the work we do. It takes a special kind of emotional distance to constantly treat sick and dying children, and this can translate into (at least at COG), a lack of emotional caring for the staff. Emotional abuse at the hands of a select few of these doctors, had become commonplace.  \r\n\r\nI have worked with plenty of brilliant, eccentric doctors in my career, but the fact that there is no HR oversight, no one defending the staff, is why some doctors may trample over those in their line of fire. Not to mention, for some God-forsaken reason, the medical director (which changes periodically) picks the COO, so that they might \"reign\" together during his/her term. Though there is an HR department, it is in name only, as they are outsourced and located 400 miles away from the organization\u2019s headquarters. I find it legally very strange that the Children\u2019s Oncology Group is never the actual employer, and instead contracts out that responsibility. Perhaps, it is to shield the leadership from liability. At one point we had an administrator who both worked under the COO and as a the \"HR liaison\" to the contracted HR firm. As you can imagine, no one told her anything. Everyone was terrified she would run right to the COO who would make it her personal mission to destroy you.\r\n\r\nThis experience was the most traumatic one I have ever had in a workplace, and one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life. I would not recommend working there to my worst enemy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good stepping stone", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Scientific Writer/Protocol Coordinator in Monrovia, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance is great; pretty much a 9-5 place.
