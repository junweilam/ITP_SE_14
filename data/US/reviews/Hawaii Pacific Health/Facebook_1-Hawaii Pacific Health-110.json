BAIT AND SWITCH! \n\nOne early Monday morning interview with the DIRECTOR of IT for HPH, (who advised I would be called in for a second, then a third interview.).  \n\nI went to work at my full time job. The Recruiter who set up interview called me within 2 hours of the initial interview, and said I got the job. She said she had sent dozens of candidates over and none of them were successful, that the response from the interview with the director was amazing, and he wanted me to start immediately, (No second interview.) Promised a full time position, they condition the offer on being able to start with ONLY ONE DAYS NOTICE to current employer. (As told to me by my recruiter.) I responded that I was obligated to give current job 2 weeks notice, as I would for any job; recruiter passed message along and then responded that they conditioned the offer on being able to start on that Wednesday. (Red flag!) \n\nIt was a $10 an hour pay increase! So I took the risk. \n\nFirst day, I was then informed it was temp position, (by the temp agency who referred me for the interview). I was assured by the director of HPH however, that it was just a technicality and a direct hire was practically guaranteed. (However I was introduced and referred to as a contractor for the length of my employ. )\n\nJob duration was 4 months, lasted exactly the span of a big project they were implementing! (How coincidental!!) \n\nI was then informed that I did an excellent job! Helped them complete the project ahead of schedule! Thank you for my services, now that the huge project was completed the workload no longer necessitated a contractor... (Coincidentally it was the last day of their fiscal budget.) \n\nI left an had an excellent full time, long term position for this endeavor, and I was ineligible for rehire back at the old company due to \"insufficient notice\"... (It is my fault because I took the risk, but there should be something to be said about the principle of good faith.... )\n\nWarning: this was for an ancillary support staff position. Don't know how they treat their medical staff. I do know that the environment is COLD and CORPORATE. \n\nImpulsive, reckless disregard for good faith. They do not keep their word, nor do they care about ancillary damage (that doesn't affect their deadlines).
