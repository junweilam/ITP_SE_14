This isn't coincidental. LVHN created a contract to move over 1000 employees to downtown Allentown (switching their income tax earning location from Salisbury township to City of Allentown) and forced the opening of the downtown facility before it was even completed with a full certificate of occupancy. Why? Because the entire \"revitalization\" project was led by an LVHN board member who had to \"step down\" once LVHN agreed to hire him to build their new facility downtown above the arena. Meanwhile, the arena is a mess rush job with cracks in concrete they are trying to repair all in order to achieve a deadline date of an opening concert and city tax implications for a September move-in date. This isn't an accusation - I was involved in the moving planning and know this to be fact. Let's keep in mind that, although against organization policy, management routinely accepts \"free gifts\" from payers they negotiate with; from attorneys and brokers they use (who are being investigated by the FBI); and from city chambers of commerce (also being investigated by the FBI). They've been smart at keeping an arms length directly away from the Mayor, but have been scheming down other avenues to be involved in the action. This is an organization that rebranded and started an insurance company 3 years ago to keep patients out of the hospital, moved the whole operation downtown, and still doesn't have 1 client. They publicly talk about their ways to keep patients out of the hospital, but keep building new units and extensions on their inpatient facilities. They are more concerned with their bond ratings then they are with their employees satisfaction - and being one of the largest employers in the Lehigh Valley, it helps to prove their immoral issues.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to make a comment about the rampant racism in the organization. If you are not white (and preferably Irish or German) you stand minimal chance of success here. I have seen people fired solely because they were black or Hispanic and \"it's too much of a pain to deal with.\" People say racist and anti-Semitic things commonly, and if it is brought to HR, nothing becomes of it, as long as a more senior manager or leader doesn't care about the racism and anti-semetism. You can literally count the number of black/Asian/Hispanic people in management on one hand.... And if you add in the number of White Jewish people, maybe you'll reach 5 or 6. And they all criticize the physicians who bring them patients and revenues who aren't white - but maintain a 1 person department (led by a white woman) on \"Culture and Diversity.\" They were all on-board to move downtown to help push the low-income minorities that normally lived there out of the area - \"leave them for St. Luke's to deal with\" was a literal quote I heard from someone in C-Suite."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Employees are disposable; there is no loyalty.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Project Manager in Allentown, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The employees are typically passionate about what they do and will go the extra mile to help each other.
