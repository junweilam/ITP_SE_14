During my time there, I witnessed 5 other hard-working, compassionate Social Workers go elsewhere due to feeling underutilized.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the management here is not very supportive of employees, particularly the Social Workers. This might be because of an inherent lack of understanding in what Social Workers know and do; I am not sure. However, I do know that you are placed in a different department and managed by nurses only, so there is a definitve disconnect between your skillset and the expectations, more so than some other local hospitals, I surmise. A frequent mantra of the management here was \"there is no division between Social Work and Case Management\" which simply is not the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nCase Managers here have an RN only for the most part (an Associate's degree) which is a degree in nursing. Unfortunately, you will frequently hear \"I need a Social Worker\" by the Case Management staff, which to me is inappropriate language for what we can offer. I often felt as though I was an assistant to Case Managers during my time here rather than a valued member of the team with a unique skillset and outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not an enviornment where you are able to hone your counseling skills. There is more of an emphasis on quantity than quality and there is a focus to maintain profits and save money. This is not an innately negative trait of a company, but I think most Social Workers tend to envision themselves in a different sort of role where they have time for more meaningful and personable interactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no LCSW's that can provide supervision, no intern opportunities, no covered CEU opportunities, no support groups, and no compensation for obtaining a higher level of licensure. The pay is higher than most jobs for Social Workers, but it is often said that other local hospitals do pay much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Case Management means in this particular hospital:\r\n\r\n-Doing discharge planning\r\n\r\n-Going back and forth between floors to cover different units when a Case Manager is off (which is every day)\r\n\r\n-Working with patients who have suicidal or homicidal ideations and/or other psychiatric issues\r\n\r\n-Attending weekly discharge meetings\r\n\r\n-Setting up transfers to other hospitals\r\n\r\n-Setting up home health, rehab, nursing home, durable medical equipment, etc.\r\n\r\n-Making APS/CPS reports often\r\n\r\n\r\nHolidays:\r\nThere are some occasions in which management will grant a holiday off, but this is taken out of your Paid Time Off accrual.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeekends:\r\nYou will have to work 2-4 weekends a year and be on unpaid on call for a week as well. That essentially means that you have to work all of the referrals (30-100 a day) that come up on that weekend day, because you will be the only person in the hospital handling referrals. Holidays are the same way, only usually there are more people there to help. Sometimes, you can get off early on a holiday. \r\n\r\n\r\nCoworkers:\r\nThere are approximately 25 Case Managers and 4 Social Workers. There are 4 floors and an inpatient rehab and Social Workers are assigned to a floor and have 2-4 Case Managers that they are expected to assist. It is a fast paced, busy job. When you have to cover other Case Managers, which is several times a week, it can become extremely busy. You are discouraged from socializing with other Social Workers so that there will not be a division in the team.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no chance for advancement for a Social Worker here, as this is the only position that this hospital employs Social Workers in.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would not recommend this hospital due to the way they structure the Social Work role and the lack of understanding about Social Workers."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Just horrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Conroe, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Staff work together because they are forced to.

You will do everyone's job until HCA  no longer wants to pay your high wages (which aren't up to what other hospitals offer)\r\n     Besides being under-staffed in all departments, you will find it hard to do your job because of the horrible way the hospital is run.  Upper management lives in a dream world.  Either they don't see what it's like for the people on the floor or they do not care.  Most equipment is outdated, broken, or not available.   An updated and refreshed look is more important than equipment needed.  It is like working in the dark ages at times and poses danger to patients and staff.  Every rule is broken until JAACO is expected.  So, for a few weeks, when the hospital prepares for the visit everything is great, then afterwards it returns to scary conditions.

We worked late hours but did not receive additional pay for extra hours worked and we do not utilize our counseling skillset at all. This is more of a job for a high school graduate than it would be for an LBSW or LMSW. They push you to work beyond your scope and put your license in jeopardy. \r\n\r\nAlso a frequent refrain here from others was \"if you leave, they will treat you the same\". I can tell you firsthand that is not the case! As social workers, we need to advocate for ourselves and our unique set of skills. There are hospitals (mostly in Houston) that utilize us more appropriately (no case management and allow us to provide counseling - no DME, home health, etc.) \r\n\r\nDuring my time here, I honestly felt like a different person. Enduring such a toxic work environment spilled over into my personal life and I wasn't able to see the negative effects until I quit and went to a job with a healthy environment and supportive staff.
