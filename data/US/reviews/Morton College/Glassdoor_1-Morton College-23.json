Also, an administration and board that frequently made things up; filed false investigations and harassed faculty.  As an aside the EX union President, didn't assert his rights by bringing union officers in on the day the school asked him to leave.  He claimed there is a gag order in affect.  He doesn't want you to know that after 35 years he too got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.   Why on earth with he agree to leave and remain mum?  Because he was an abuser, and because the school finally found a way to get him out.  He was a thug.  They too were thugs.  I should write a book about all that I know.

There is a union but it is so weak it's laughable, as most unions are these days. The buildings are old, most classrooms lack technological capabilities, counseling services are a joke, and the whole place runs on the backs of seriously underpaid adjunct faculty who think they might get a full time position someday but will actually be fired after 5-7 years. The quality of the education to be had here is spotty at best, with the exception of the nursing program, which is quite good. In these days of lean pickings, if you can get workhere, take it...but plan on leaving soon if you want happiness and advancement at work.
