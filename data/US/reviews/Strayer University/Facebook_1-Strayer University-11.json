The turnover is unusually high, and even the students will ask why there are always new people working in the administration office. The students are also always concerned about classes being canceled or their campus getting closed. Despite what they are being told- they have every right to be concerned. Everything is treated as a secret at Strayer, to the employees and students alike. No one knows what bad decision will be enforced next, until the changes have already been made.\r\n\r\nMiddle management (the Campus Directors) seem to be under a significant amount of pressure to \"bring in the numbers\", which means that every single one of them constantly micromanages everything that goes on in Admissions. And if for some reason you cannot meet their unrealistic quota (for reasons, such as, it's the week before Christmas and no one wants to talk to you about going to college) you are not only publicly chastised in front of all your colleagues, but you are told that if you keep that up you will be without a job. That is, unless you are said manager's favorite employee- nepotism runs rampant throughout this company. People are promoted due to being a favorite employee, regardless of their ability to manage or handle the responsibility of the position. For instance, incompetent workers are being promoted to Campus Director positions, even without the minimum of a college degree.\r\n\r\nThis pressure from management permeates among the lower level employees, and causes \"team members\" to steal sales (aka students) from each other, etc. This kind of behavior is only encouraged, since these \"high performers\" are put on a pedestal and then promoted even without possessing basic management skills. These favorites then get preferential treatment, for things such as salary. There is NO standard salary at Strayer- as an Admissions Officer some people earned as little as $34,000 while others earned \"as much as\" $45,000.

I actually was offered jobs with 3 other companies and turned them down because I was so excited about the possibility of working for this company. Not at all what I was lead to believe and or expected. It is a complete and total sales position.They give off the impression that you will be helping students achieve a better life. Total joke! Seriously, the only way to do well at this company is to adopt a sales mindset and throw out any possibility of really connecting with the students. It is a complete and total numbers game. They only care about the numbers so much that if you tell upper management you truly believe a student is not a good fit for this university, then they will just pass your student off to the another admissions officer and see if they can enroll the student instead. So more often than not you're cheating the students by talking them into gaining an education with our university when in fact, they're accruing several thousand in debt. They probably won't graduate because they should have attended a brick and mortar institution instead but were lead to believe that this is the best education they'll receive. LIES. The company also promises numerous opportunities for growth and advancement but advancement isn't based off of merit. It is a boys club and with very few women in upper management. Women can only be promoted if they're willing to play \"the game\". They also say they promote people based off of their numbers for prior quarters but coming from an admissions officer who actually did well in their position despite all the foolishness, this isn't the case either.  Anyone who is in upper management got there clearly because they were friends with someone else in upper management. You can put your hand in the pot several times but unless you're willing to play the game, you're not going to move up in this company. Not to mention the corporate office visits on numerous occasions and they give these grand speeches of how well the company is doing and that there will be more possibilities of progress/advancement with raises included. Total joke and everybody worth their salt knows it. It was as if corporate was dangling a carrot in our faces, like we were children and would believe anything they told us. Yet we asked the same questions every meeting \"how long will our office be here?\", \"will (blank) dept be shutting down\", \"will there be an increase in pay anytime soon?\" Never got a straight answer and most of the time we were told that they were taking our questions into consideration and that they working on it. I was with the company for one year and it was the same b/s every time. I got so fed up with it  that I finally just resigned. Not to mention more than half the managers at the company don't know how to manage people. They literally treat us like we're children, buying our lunches every so often so as to compensate for the what they are clearly lacking. Several people are hired as temps then laid off shortly thereafter without any warning and lots of people just end up quitting. Don't bother putting in a two week notice either, cause typically they won't let you finish the two weeks. It's not worth it to work there, especially if you're passionate about education. If you want to make a difference in someone's life, work for a traditional university as an advisor or something similar. Take my advice and walk the other way. It's a perfect job if: you're sales oriented and it doesn't really matter what you sell, you don't mind sucking up and being apart of clearly a \"boys club\",  don't mind lunches as substitutions for raises, and don't need a work life balance because you'll spend long hours meeting your numbers here, then this is the perfect job for you."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good Job Between Careeers.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Feb 2013", "job_title": "Admissions Officer in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My location had a great work enviroment.

With these attitudes, students became angry.  There was no team environment and it made it very miserable to work there.  \r\n\r\nWork/life balance was stressful due to inconsistent evening & weekend rotations with coworkers. I expected to have to work evenings and weekends because I've had experience in this line of work, but I seriously feel that I had less of a life at home during my employment with this company.   \r\n\r\nThe company seems great, so maybe future employees would have a better experience in a different campus environment than the one I was in.  I went home in tears several times and woke up dreading to go into work.  My negative experience really was more about the daily environment and the campus staff than the company itself.  \r\n\r\nManagers spent several TWO hour lunches together gossiping or being loud in the break area.  If I ever ran into questions that needed immediate answers, I felt hesitant to interrupt those \"lunches\" in fear of being looked at with the side eye or spoken to with an attitude."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Admissions Coordinator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Admissions Coordinator in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The positive interaction shared w/ students, and the 90% tuition discount along with the Corporate Perks are a great pros.", "cons": "You are often in the dark about position, not to mention the Pay could be better being that their is no sense of stability. \nMicro Managed\nCentralization"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "SU", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Resource Library Assistant in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great interaction with the students in helping them building their education.
