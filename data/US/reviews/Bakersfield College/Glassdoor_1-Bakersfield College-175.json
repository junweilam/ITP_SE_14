These goals are often sudden random thoughts that are not planned strategically or with efficiency in mind. We are not given the resources (people, time, technology, budget) to make these things happen in a short amount of time at a ridiculously professional (not education) standard and it causes a lot of stress for those that have to make it happen.\r\n\r\nPeople are often expected to work even during their time off. If you are a classified employee, read your contract and make sure to push back when BC administration pushes management to contact you after hours, on the weekends, when you are sick, and during vacations. Management doesn't have that luxury and end up working with no days off, getting calls before 5AM, and being expected to work during their vacation. There is no respect for a work/life balance, no forethought or planning to make the business side of the school more efficient. There is also no concern for the employees and you have to protect yourself.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, many of the job descriptions are written so that they can require you to have too wide of a range of skills. These descriptions were written so that they could use them in a wide array of jobs. The issue is that they are now used to make one person do all of the work that is in the description which was written before each of those duties became so extensive that they each need to be their own job. The procedure for updating a job description only lends itself to adding duties that may not have been listed before. It does not take into account that the description is no longer industry standard, that it was written poorly, or that the duties require different, separate, skill sets.\r\n\r\nWhile these job descriptions are written so broadly that they encompass too many skill sets, when hiring, skills of the applicants are often ignored. This is in part due to no one having that wide of a skill set and if they did, they could make much more money at a larger corporation. The other part is that nepotism is rampant and hiring committees, used to make the hiring process fair, are often pressured to hire specific people rather than the best qualified due to favoritism and promises made by administration. Of course, there is nothing ever in writing about this making it hard to prove other than performance of the candidates. The leadership does not show integrity nor morals."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Pay", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Academic Counselor in Bakersfield, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Environment!
