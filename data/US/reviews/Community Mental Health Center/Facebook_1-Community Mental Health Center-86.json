Turnover is high in the MH department due to the low pay, high stress, and pressure to carry a large caseload. People in other departments do not really understand what mental health clinicians really do, the amount of indirect work required for each patient along with the large caseloads is almost unmanageable. Mental health documentation was an afterthought on the platform we use, it is slow, there are too many choices to sort through and too many mouse clicks, after each click 4-5 seconds minimum to load, and this only serves to drag out the time it takes to enter documentation , Other non-clinicians have much more downtime and it is common for some of them to sit and chat with co-workers, for hours, or be on their phone, or shop online while the rest of us are slammed with work. Some co-workers are out of the office sick a lot and oftentimes we don't know about it until we try to find that person. Some co-workers do not respect boundaries, nor the fact that MH clinician's have strict ethics/laws/HIPPA that we must follow or risk losing our licenses. Admin staff is not trained at all on anything other than the phones, which is a huge liability, and the MH dept does not have time to train people who have never worked in the MH/medical field. We are told we have to work our full 40 hours, although we are salary, yet others often leave for lunch and leave early. Clickish at times, and MH workers often are out of the loop because our workload is so high we don't have time to sit around and talk."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Lawrenceburg, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A big pro is they have great people in administration!", "cons": "The mental health industry is lower paying in general, so that would be the biggest con."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "24 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Therapist in Batesville, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of ways to explore what population and what skills you'd like to use", "cons": "Low pay, large caseload, understaffed"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Low Pay and long hours", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 May 2021", "job_title": "Therapist in Lawrenceburg, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supervision is provided and trainings", "cons": "Low pay and long hours .
