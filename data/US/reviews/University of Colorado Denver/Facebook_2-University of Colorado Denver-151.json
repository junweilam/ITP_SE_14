It will always be VERY low compared to the private sector. With a few job opportunities looked into - including benefits, data people are still grossly underpaid comparatively. It can be frustrating seeing friends in the private sector making money hand over fist, and I can't even afford central a/c apartments if I want to live in Denver (while following financial wellness rules of thumb). - Little negotiating for low-level people. It is a double-edged sword in that HR told me it is all a formula- Years of Experience + Education + Job Code. So not positive or negative. It is what it is. It is nice knowing your coworker is getting paid the same (all inputs being equal) besides the small yearly merit raises. - Flat Admin Organizations means you top out very fast, Job Code wise. Once you are a Principal, the only way to keep going up is to become a manager. This sucks in the IT world because, as a Data Analyst currently, I know there should be higher job codes to shoot for (DBA, Data Scientist, Architect, etc.), but from my understanding, those job codes don't exist (Those people exist, though. My current thought is those positions are outside the typical job code structure)\u2014so no pay bumps and no incentive to shoot for the next rung in the data world. - Parking on Campus (Cost vs. how close you are to your building), but I don't know of a University where that isn't an issue. - How siloed data sources are and trying to get access to them is exceptionally frustrating - No encompassing data culture.

My ratings and comments are only in regards to the dental school. There is a high amount of employee turnover from newer employees (2 years or less) trying to come in and make a difference. I believe it is because the bulk of the existing staff and faculty have been there for 4 years to decades, and are stuck doing things \"the way they have always been done\". They are reluctant to hire new employees. They don't want to be questioned on their out-dated way of doing things. Instead, they find someone internal within the dental school who has already drunk the kool-aid. They want \"yes\" people. The culture is toxic, and they applaud those who push others way around. There is a lot of bullying here by those with power and are liked by the deans.

Everything is supported by grants (soft money) with very limited administrative support. All the administration cares for is money, not the well-being of faculty. They create stress and ask you to get help for mental health instead of alleviating stress. Low salaries and a work environment that rewards bullying, harassment and retaliation. No faculty advocates at the AMC campus. All is run by the administration and goes through the administration. The \"Professional Office\" which is supposed to mitigate complaints does not represent faculty, but rather the administration. As such faculty have no voice. They also would like to advertise AMC as a \"breakthrough\" campus in research when it only applies for a few labs. They try to hide the many wrongs and appeal to the generosity of donors. There are no subsidies for the use of cores as there are in other top tier universities. The cores are slow since they have no support, parking is expensive."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Pretty standard research position", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Research Coordinator in Aurora, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Super flexible schedule, crazy amount of PTO and generally employee centered environment.", "cons": "Pay is not competitive.

I believe it is because the bulk of the existing staff and faculty have been there for 4 years to decades, and are stuck doing things \"the way they have always been done\". They are reluctant to hire new employees. They don't want to be questioned on their out-dated way of doing things. Instead, they find someone internal within the dental school who has already drunk the kool-aid. They want \"yes\" people. The culture is toxic, and they applaud those who push others way around. There is a lot of bullying here by those with power and are liked by the deans.
