Wonderful community based non profit hospital. I love this hospital.", "cons": "They use you to cover until they get the staff that are younger and fresh out of school, or other medical offices. Closer you get to a year the more the pressure is turned up.  Health issues in your family may concern them about FMLA after a year. Moms returning to work force beware! Leadership is not well liked,  has just been there too long to let go.\r\n  Targeting  for any mistake made, blowing it up and exaggerating  feedback to create a paper work trail that gives  good cause to get rid of you are tactics employed. All may occur weeks before your final large bonus is due. Those bonuses,  have to be offered because they burned so many bridges. Having read all the toxic reviews about working in the lab,considered and thought, just work hard and stay out of the fray. HA! Good luck with that plan. \r\nThe most senior staff work days and  are a circle the wagons click. Gossip behind backs while being nice to people's face is standard \r\nCriticism  that manageent  has never worked a bench in that lab. Has no idea what the front end actually does and regards it like light secretarial duties. Plays favorites. Does not listen to anyone unless collecting evidence to document transgressions for a smear campaign to let go or build pressure to quit is standard\r\nRegularly instructed to not upset management by being told  just to say yes, on that, never ask questions or defend against any allegations at risk of being labeled defensive. Management responds to requests for  help by reading a poster in the break room that talks about team spirit and  then suggests the requestor is not spirited enough. Exaggeration of people's comments to help make a case of failure against employees, suggesting they did something horribly wrong. Promised additional training, but never recieved. Asked to cover endless understaffed shifts, where you do the job of 2 or 3 people., always with pressure that everyone is picking up extra shifts.\r\nOut sick for a week with a doctors note once in close to a year? Will be warned  you are over the 3% absent rate that is hospital policy because they dont count all the extra shifts one may have covered. \r\n As soon as one is no longer needed to cover vacant positions tone changes to a negative evaluation of your job performance.\r\nNo concern at all about you or your family., regardless time and efforts put in management will  send cards, make\r\nappropriate comments all while mounting a campaign to get people to quit.  Management is seen as  just walking the road to retirment.\r\nOne will do so much work for slightly more than one could make working at McDonald's in the early morning. \r\nThis is a warning for those going in. \r\nMake friends and don't upset anyone\r\nor you will be marked as  low hanging fruit quick if you do. Be ready to work your bum off and never be defensive. Do not tell anyone what to do ever, not even if they ask, just say oh I am not sure and be super happy and pleasant at all times. Answer management with with yes, no problem, I can do that, always.\r\n Be perfect at your job as much as possible. Don't forget to do anything ever! Do all your work and then look for extra. Don't get sucked into the (low census, leave early nightmare.) Just work your whole shift always. \r\n Turn over is rampant. The best get transferred, the middle of the road get forced to quit and the worst get fired. \r\n Honestly, you could save yourself all kinds of awful and just go work anywhere in the hospital but the lab! It's not worth the stress! \r\nOther departments in the hospital are great Human nature I suppose to say oh come on how bad can it be? Well , far worse than ever imagined. There are many super nice folks that work there, too. But, the leadership is draining people due to endless criticism, and insincere,occasional positive commentary. This flattery usually precedes a request for working another weekend or covering someone's  shift.\r\nTread carefully and never stop.\r\nYou are only as valuable as the next hire. \r\nGood luck."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 May 2023", "job_title": "Executive Assistant in Saint Albans, VT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fair employer Good environment Collaborative opportunities", "cons": "No career advancement or opportunities"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Leadership Turnover", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Director in Saint Albans, VT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small community hospital valued by the community.
