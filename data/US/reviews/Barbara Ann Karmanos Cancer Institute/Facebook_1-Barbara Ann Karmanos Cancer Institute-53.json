Contributions to retirement dropped down to 6, to 3 and finally 1 % match up to I think 1500 before I left. Many jobs were eliminated and Hospice was done away with altogether since once patients are no longer considered curable-Karmanos does not receive enough research grants to make it worth it to keep hospice. Truly upper management is so focused on chasing the research dollar I believe they have lost site of the fact that treating the patient should be continuous up to and including hospice and end of life care. It is very cold and callous when there is no further treatment useful to say to a patient we can no longer care for you and are referring you out for end of life care. Granted this is a nursing point of view. I was very disheartened and discouraged to see them disband their hospice department-when there was no financial reason to do so-it was completely in the black and not a financial loss.
