This can limit one's ability to show career growth on their resume, but if you are focused on learning a lot and working with intelligent people, this quickly becomes an afterthought.\r\n\r\nMost research employees are underpaid, relative to industry standards, b/c it is academia, where money isn't as abundant as in industry.

On one hand, Stanford tells you that since you have amazing benefits, your salary can't be too high. Then they wonder why the turnover rate is insane. Once you begin and learn that the previous person was making a lot more than you, you automatically begin to shut-down. Your performance plummets and you begin running like a rabbit to get the hell out of there. They're simply not direct or honest in their hiring process. The salary range they provide (if they still do that, I haven\u2019t been a part of Stanford for sometime), is extremely misleading. Whatever job you take, expect your salary to be on the very low-end of that scale. Also, expect whatever job you take to be directly affected by your previous position. If you went from a gardner to a Doctor, Stanford HR will insist to pay you based on your gardening income. This hardly happens, but you get the picture. \r\n\r\nIf you're making salary X, it will be below market. Why? They tell you that your benefits account for an additional 30% of \"income.\" Well, OK that sounds great right? Then if you were to get that same position as an hourly staff, do you think they would pay you your original hourly income plus that 30%? Dream on. They will tell you that what you're making per hour is too high. You'll most likely make your annual salary's hourly rate even when you have no benefits. This way, they pay their full-times employees little by telling them they have great benefits and also keep their hourly employees with low wages by touting their \"high\" hourly wages. \r\n\r\nMost of the benefits are accounting tricks. They say you get X value of benefits, when they probably pay a tenth of that to the benefit provider. So, they screw you over and still expect you to thank them. They\u2019re not hiring idiots, but they treat you like one.\r\n\r\nExample: You're making 100k with benefits. 100k comes out to ~$50 per hour. Uncle Sam, takes around ~35% (maybe more depending on your circumstance). So, you're actual hourly rate is around $37. With Stanford's benefits, that's not a bad deal at all assuming that you're getting paid the right salary for that job. But, you'll likely make $70k ($35/hour) at Stanford because they inflate benefits. The $35/hour after taxes is around $25/hour. So you just lost over $10 per hour because of the way they calculate your salary. \r\n\r\nSo, you decide why not work strictly as an hourly employee? I'll at least make more per hour since they'll use the same calculation to add the 30% of benefits to my hourly income right? Wrong. If you were hired as hourly, you may be lucky to earn $40/hour without benefits for a job with $35 with benefits that should actually pay $50/hour. You ask them, wait a second what about the fact that this job has no benefits? They tell you that the typical hourly of a similar position is $35 (They don\u2019t mention benefits) and you're getting overpaid at $40/hour. \r\n\r\nBasically, when it benefits them to include benefits so they don't have to pay full-time employees well, they do. When it benefits them to solely focus on your hourly to pay their hourly employees little, they do the same. \r\n\r\nAs someone else already mentioned, this is a great place to learn, grow and move on (either to a higher position at Stanford or another place). If you decide to stay complacent and stay in the same position for more than two years, you'll hate yourself forever. \r\n\r\nDon't buy into the idea that Stanford is an educational non-profit.

Though she may argue she is being \"honest\" her comments has no place in a professional environment. She even turned her employees against each other. When I was a contractor I was once stupid enough to believe her. To add insult to injury the head of the department makes a ton of money, but shares none of it with his employees.

Postdoc salaries are traditionally lower than many unionized manual labor employees at Stanford. Postdoc and Junior faculty salaries are typically not sufficient to obtain affordable single housing whilst not being \"rent-burdened\" (>30% of gross salary going to rent). Postdocs are currently paid $63,700 ($5,308/month). In order to not be rent-burdened, one must obtain housing for less than $1592/month. 1 bedroom rentals in the bay area are $2,500-3,000/month. Stanfords own 1 bedroom apartments which are \"below market\" rent for $2,763-$3545 (as of May 2020). A Salary in excess of $110K is required to not be rent-burdened in below-market-rate housing. To work at Stanford is to lose $1,000-$1,500 a month compared to a similar position almost anywhere else. \r\n\r\n 2) People don't matter. The big theme I have noticed is that people and relationships are disposable commodities. The things that are important are resources, money, control, and prestige. People can be exploited, disposed of, used, and mistreated in pursuit of those priorities because people can always be replaced at Stanford. The general operating procedure is to exploit the innovative thinking of a wide base of disposable postdocs and non-tenure line, soft-money junior faculty members. This pattern leads to aspiring permanent faculty members jockeying to exploit each other and trainees for artificially scarce resources. Those that are the best at exploiting others rise to the top and vicious cycle. This exploitation dynamic often creates work situations that qualify as toxic workplaces. I estimate approximately 30% of my working time at Stanford is consumed by defending against political maneuvering aimed at seizing resources, labor, products, or credit for the things and ideas that I have generated. That is far too much.\r\n\r\n3) Researchers (that do not also provide clinical services) do not achieve regular faculty positions. The have non-faculty titles like \"instructor\" which anywhere else would be an Assitant Professor level position. The funding levels required for a permanent position is the equivalent of 2.5 R01 level grants ( a total of $17M every 5 years), in perpetuity. The average age of a scientist receiving their first R01 is 43. So this standard is beyond extremely difficult. The medical school does not actually pay researchers' a salary. The researchers have to pay 100% of their own salary from the grants they receive (100% soft money). If you can not raise 100% of your salary you are fired or reduce your working hours to match the grant money you have. 56% of the funding from these grants goes to support institutional administrative costs. Administrators do not have to raise money for their own salaries. There are many many more administrators that researchers. \r\n\r\n4) The Stanford name isn't that helpful. People that work at Stanford think that having the Stanford name on their resume/CV is a big bonus for obtaining their next job. From my experience so far it really isn't that helpful. People often recognize the name but the name will not be the thing that will determine if you get your next job. The name is certainly not worth what you give up in terms of money and speed of career advancement."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Value", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Dec 2012", "job_title": "PhD Student in Palo Alto, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The name of the university can get you anywhere and is internationally impressive.
