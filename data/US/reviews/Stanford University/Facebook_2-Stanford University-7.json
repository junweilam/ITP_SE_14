The thing that caught me most by surprise was the motivation of women in senior leadership positions to actively bully and mistreat other women with high potential, and leaders who were happy to look the other way as long as the status quo was maintained. The environment isn't toxic for everyone, but if you have any sense of confidence, ambition, or rightly assume that you have something to contribute, you should anticipate these qualities becoming a problem. It's interesting that many of the HR people migrate between the university and the hospitals. Essentially, you get the same people floating in and out of different parts of of the Stanford system and I can't help but wonder if that maintains the dysfunction that Stanford is known for. The best advice I could give anyone is to document every single remotely toxic situation you find yourself in. Don't bother sending anything to Labor and Relations. Send it to the EEOC.

Campus was extremely accessible due to Stanford's internal shuttle (Marguerite) which runs around the campus as well as to some peripheral areas including the Palo Alto Caltrain station. The shuttle is accessible to people with physical disabilities. The working environment on our project specifically was healthy, but I cannot speak on the professional environment of Stanford in general. The opportunity to work alongside Stanford's eminent faculty and staff opens up extremely valuable networking opportunities. Food options on campus are quite good, especially at the Tressider Union building. Food tents representing local restaurants would also come weekly on Tuesdays, which were all very good. In my role, the work environment was relatively relaxed so long as productivity was good, and I was allowed quite a bit of independence. We were provided with dedicated work laptops, monitors, and standard computer peripherals upon employment, though that may have only been possible due to the size of the grant that funded our project. Free and open seminars are accessible on campus periodically, and full-time employees have the option to attend a small selection of courses for free, which my supervisor was more than willing to be flexible about, schedule-wise, so long as progress continued as normal on the project.", "cons": "Personally, I felt alienated by the explicitly elitist culture of Stanford.

Contrary to many good reviews posted here, my experience was dreadful and eye-opening. One thing people should know is that working as a full-time employee at Stanford is a completely different story versus being a student at Stanford. Ever since the very beginning of my employment, I constantly got insulted, publicly humiliated, and criticized in front of other students, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable and awful. In the end, as I found this distorted environment very uncomfortable and harmful to my personal growth, I decided to resign from my job. \r\n\r\n\"I know people working in research institutes are laid back. Don't think about coming here to relax! You are here to contribute!\" This was what I was told during the first video chat. Since I previously worked in a research institute, I felt uncomfortable and was wrongly judged once I heard this. And all the excitement I had felt when I received my offer was half-way gone. \r\n\r\nI started as a volunteer for three months during my time at Stanford. During the first three volunteering months, I was outside of the country and completed nearly 20 Github tickets. In the middle of this period, one of my important family members was diagnosed with a severe disease which I notified the team so that they could be aware of my limited bandwidth working on this project. I was never informed any negative feedback during this three months until the first day of my employment, which was around late Sep.2019, when our team had our first video meeting, I was publicly criticized for my speed upon finishing those tickets in front of everyone in the team who I had never met before. And at that time I realized that I was the only female engineer on the team.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, during our 1-on-1 meeting, I was told that I got criticized on speed earlier was because I only replied \"okay\" when I was assigned with tickets. I was quite confused at that time. But I certainly wanted to give it more time to try out.\r\n\r\nThings got worse later. Our communication is primarily through Slack from the beginning of my employment, face-to-face communication happened rarely, which made it extremely hard. When we had a one-on-one meeting, I wasn\u2019t given clear expectations upon finishing my tasks, such as speed and detailed features. Instead, I consistently got criticize during our group meeting, in front of all other male group members. For instance, when the quarter started, I was thrown 15~ 20 Github tickets, and no more details. Then I followed whatever documented in the tickets and submitted my implementation. In the middle of the quarter, during a group meeting, which happened once per week, I was assigned a completely new goal that I wasn\u2019t even aware of in the past. Then, at the end of the quarter, I was shouted and wrongly judged in front of other team members on trivial things that others won\u2019t get blamed about. By then, since I didn\u2019t feel things go well, I asked for expectations and the reasons behind all the judgments. What I got was: I got pushed because the previous developer didn\u2019t pay attention to those details. A few months later, in our one-on-one meeting, the meeting that I decided to resign, I was told that I got more criticized in the first quarter was because I was slow in finishing those tickets. You can see there was not only unreasonable judgment (I was blamed for the previous developer\u2019s fault) but also a clear inconsistency during the feedback, which is neither authentic nor helpful.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I didn\u2019t have any freedom to express my own ideas. Whenever I brought up different designs for the topics that we discussed, I always got insulting facial expressions and violent verbal comments.\r\n\r\nIn the Github ticket review, I often got random, meaningless comments from others who didn\u2019t pay any effort to carefully look through the changes I made. Moreover, many of the feedback I got included sentences like: \u201cI don\u2019t think this would work.\u201d, \u201cYour behavior is unreasonable.\u201d \u201cCan you appreciate how clean the code is now?\u201d, which are never true and valid. I feel very frustrated whenever I saw or heard this type of comment that involved personal, biased judgments. I had tried several times to bring up my concerns, e.g. set up a clear goal of what to accomplish for each ticket. But each time the reply I got was \u201cyou should make an educated guess.\u201d \r\n\r\nThen I was publicly judged in a group meeting: \u201cshe just listens and says yes to whatever others said, without any of her own opinions.\u201d When this happened, no one did anything to stop his behavior. \r\n\r\nAs the only female engineer in this team, I never felt I was supported in this environment. I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Stanford\u2019s culture. It\u2019s a shame that they are cultivating an atmosphere that undermining and devaluing female engineers is a natural and valid behavior stemming from this school, a school particularly famous for its leading position in computer science in both academia and industry. Those swirls of negative energy not only inhibit female engineers from reaching their true potential but also deeply diminish motivation for those who want to advance in computer science or work at Stanford."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 May 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Stanford, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay compared to other STEM programs and schools", "cons": "Very expensive housing around the area"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Research Excellence", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Stanford, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Having an experienced principal investigator makes the Stanford experience worthwhile", "cons": "The university often overlooks many professional development needs of graduate students and can offer little support"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Postdoc Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 May 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Scholar in Stanford, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Collaborative Postdoc Community\nPostdoc association for social support\nAdmin efficient and helpful", "cons": "Area has a high cost of living compared to salary\nIntense work environment"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Stressful PhD", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 May 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Stanford, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really smart professors and basically guaranteed financial security", "cons": "Everyone is EXTREMELY stressed out"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "In these challenging times", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Senior Information Security Engineer in Stanford, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stanford is rather conservative in most of its choices around staffing and funding, often resulting in a stable and predictable trajectory.

The pay, however, does not correspond to your education level. I have a PhD and they pay me like someone fresh out of college.  I work part time on grant-based projects. I don't get health insurance. They deliberately budget my hours just below the threshold where they'd have to give me health benefits.\r\nThere's inequity within my group in who gets reimbursed for travel expenses to the same conferences, based on job position. You have to be full-time or find outside funding to get reimbursed."}]]
