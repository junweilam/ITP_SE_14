If you like to succumb, be discriminated for the gender (apply to female) and in many department you won't see a single person of diversity holding senior position and all decisions are made by 2-3 white guys. If anyone is considering to come to this campus even to work as a part of administration they should seriously think before it. They will be only used as a tool and when their use is over, they will be thrown out unless the person coming in is political. This is not a place that bring any research prosperity or satisfaction to work for. The paycheck is higher compared to anywhere in nation not because they hire best though because the best never comes here and if ever it comes, it leaves as soon as they. I know many faculties in Agricultural sciences, chemistry & biochemistry, dairy sciences and other who have left at very senior positions. This campus is worst place to work in the US. Apart from this Graduate students have the tough time as well, lack of supervision is the beginning of long list, financial support is inadequate compared to the cost very high living in Brookings, SD (thanks to the over inflated real-estate market - low-income house - food stamp price gouging). Irrespective of one being either a agriculture science/ dairy science/ chemistry/ biochemistry faculty if the person is apolitical and unless he isn't the part of inner clout of corrupt and manipulating administration that person has no chance to survive. senior faculty belittling, bullying, discriminating their juniors is a common practice and one that is very encouraged by senior in departments and by senior management. The unwritten but often practiced rule of SDSU is that as soon as a new faculty joins the campus, they should be made to fail and leave.
