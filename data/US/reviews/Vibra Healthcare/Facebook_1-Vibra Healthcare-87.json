What you will learn is the intricacies of managing/dealing with low quality and/or toxic people at all levels. Which will help later in your career. There are hardly any growth opportunities. Only time I ever witnessed management turnover was 1) reactivate to firings and 2) filling of immediate needs due to a merger/acquisition of Ernest Health facilities. Physical paper is the name of the game. Meaning you print work papers, compile/annotate and rescan into a filing database for almost everything. Ton of wasted time but this may have changed during COVID to accommodate remote work. The con of cons is toxic management. Never have I witnessed such pettiness and lack of empathy anywhere. Think the saddest thing I saw was the layoff of an employee who gave 30 years of her life to the company probably because some spreadsheet indicated that it was the right thing to do.

Management is unsympathetic and will just keep taking more admissions even though they do not have the staff to care for them.  Nurses are also expected to work \"hard to fill holidays\"  (Mother's Day, Halloween, ect) without bonuses or incentives. If you get low cenus you are expected to be on call for the the first 4hrs of your shift, also without \"on call pay\".  If you work at any of the Vibra of Southeastern Michigan you are forced to work all three facilities if they are short staffed and can be pulled to other locations without notice.  Lincoln park, Detroit and Taylor.....it's not like being pulled to another unit as a float nurse, they expect you to work in 3 different cities.  If you complain or refuse they find a way to fire you.  Management is all about the bottom line and do not care about nursing staff or pt care. The CEO gets bonuses every year for coming in under budget meanwhile the nurses do not have enough equiptment ( BP machines, digital thermometers, accuchecks) which are often broken or must be shared.
