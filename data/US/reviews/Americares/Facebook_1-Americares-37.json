The only downside is that when donations are down, the organization cannot do as much for others and when they had to let people go save on funds,  some experienced people were let go and severance was minimal although the organization offered some time of re-employment workshops.  I think that we were such a close group, I am sure that the environment has changed and it will be a while before things get somewhat back to normal.
