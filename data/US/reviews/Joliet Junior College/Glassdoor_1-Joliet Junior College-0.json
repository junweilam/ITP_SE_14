(I did raise my voice, but did not yell.) HR is not there to be a resource for the employees; they exist solely as a watchdog for management.\r\n\r\nLeadership is lopsided; The Board of Trustees is over the President, and the Board agrees on almost nothing. Therefore, when decisions must be made, consensus is rare. Watching the Board fight is entertaining, though, which is a plus.\r\n\r\nPay is a mockery. I was paid about 20 percent less than the same position elsewhere. Some professional positions are classified as clerical - as was mine - so management can continue to over-work and under-pay employees. My supervisor routinely denied me overtime pay or comp time, telling me it wasn't available for my position, and this was in direct violation of policy.\r\n\r\nIn short, Joliet Junior College is probably great for long-term employees who don't want to work very hard. It is not good for someone who wants career growth and opportunity. I learned what I could from this dismal place, and within two years moved on to a position at least two steps up from what JJC made available to me."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Going down hill fast", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Romeoville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, friendly environment, most people put the students first, beautiful campus, great location, lots of great lunch options nearby.", "cons": "Politics, lack of leadership, overspending, nepotism, Unions make this place a mess, HR doesn't help but instead protects the bad management"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It\u2019s just okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "26 May 2020", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor of Reading in Joliet, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice facility, syllabus and materials provided", "cons": "Do not follow seniority in scheduling (per contract they are supposed to), online training with no chance of getting online courses, hire way too many adjuncts with not enough positions"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Just too good to leave just yet.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Adm Assistant in Joliet, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful Manager, caring and understanding.
