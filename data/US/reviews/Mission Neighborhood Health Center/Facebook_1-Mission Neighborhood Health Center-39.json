If you ever get a raise, (I got one and it was around a .25 cent increase), they tell you not to tell your coworkers or mention your wages, which is illegal because you have a right to discuss your salary. Only some departments have unions, but some managers would discourage that other departments try to unionize. The staff have historically gone on strike and would protest to management to increase their wages and that same discussion continues to this day. They provide minimum training and it feels so isolating because you get no support when you have a question or need more staff to support a patient."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Disappointing", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Staff RN in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Select staff are committed to working and improving the clinic and patient experience.", "cons": "Staff are overworked.
