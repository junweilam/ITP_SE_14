Other departments may be managed differently. \n\n-As a mid-level employee, I have never felt obligated to work after 5:00 or on weekends.\n-For younger or less seasoned development professionals, SMU is a great place to learn the ropes.\n-SMU looks better on a resume for recruiters than working for a small local nonprofit. \n-A lot of the people I work with are truly great individuals with a lot to learn from. \n-Holiday leave time is good - you get Christmas Eve through New Year's Day off. \n-If you want a graduate degree, there are tuition benefits - you do pay taxes on those so beware on how much of a pro that is against the salary being offered\n-401k match and dedicated retirement consultant \n-Benefits are decent", "cons": "-Extremely rare for them to consider anyone internally for promotion. \n-Limited vacation, with no increase until you begin your 6th year of employment\n-Must pay for parking and, due to constantly shrinking parking availability from the construction of new buildings, it's a toss-up if you will even have a parking spot available that you pay for. \n-No true concern for employee wellness. It is mandated you cannot work from home, and they will not work with you even if you have a child at home and need to occasionally work remote.\n-Professional Development is micromanaged and not relevant to all positions. You have to justify through 3 levels above you to be considered to be approved for your own professional development opportunity that is a nominal cost. \n-This department is run by fear and an old-school mindset. You better be in your chair from 8:30 to 5:00. Meetings are regularly scheduled at 4 pm on a Friday to ensure you are here all day. \n-Communication amongst the department is terrible. You get your hand slapped a lot because middle management didn't pass a message down, and there is a sense of upper management being delighted in the opportunity for gotcha moments for minor \"offenses\" that you weren't aware were even a problem \n-1 to 2% raises are terrible when coupled with the fact that you pay for parking, and your gas - seeing as most people who work here don't make enough to live anywhere near the campus\n-Limited opportunities to negotiate better pay and a confusing review process that does not coincide with the same time of year that supervisors submit compensation requests\n-Salaries - at least for mid to lower-level employees - are low. I make $15,000 less than the average compensation for my role in Dallas.

Finals must be graded, returned to the supervising professor, and input into the computer within 48 hours of the final exam.  This frequently requires TAs to grade non-stop for roughly 24-36 hours in order to turn the exams back into the supervising professor, many of who want to review the exams before entering them into the grade book.  The difficulty associated with administering and grading final exams must also include the fact that TAs are taking their own exams at the same time. \r\n\r\nEach supervising professor had very different expectations.

Tuition benefit is nice and retirement plan is very good.", "cons": "Disclosure: I'm a mildly disgruntled employee. Not because I was fired (I left SMU of my own choosing), but because of what I saw as mismanagement and incompetence from leadership that cost many people their jobs. \r\n\r\nI left this school after more than a decade with the feeling that there was a lack of respect for staff among faculty and leadership. There is always going to be a divide between the academics and staff at any university. But at SMU that divide is the grand canyon. \r\n\r\nThe situation has only gotten worse since the budget crunch and hiring of Bain Consulting to make streamlining recommendations. Everyone on staff knows that the budget crunch comes from an overcommitment to building new facilities (including the Bush Library) coupled with the unexpected financial downturn several years ago. Now the staff and services are paying the bill and it's hard not to resent it.\r\n\r\nIronically, when leadership is made up entirely of the academics, the brunt of the budget cuts come at the expense of the staff and services. Funny how that works. In the end, the students are the ones to suffer. \r\n\r\nIt also impacted the benefits. Insurance contributions have tripled since the budget cutting began. Raises are few and far between. They give a 1-2% COLA if you are lucky but then call it a \"merit raise.\" So, there aren't actually ANY merit raises. Good luck trying to cross bid into a different job because every school runs itself like an independent subsidiary. HR has almost no process for employees to cross bid into jobs in other parts of the university. So the job you hire into will most likely be the only job you ever have at SMU.\r\n\r\nThe staff work very hard to make everything run smoothly but are treated as second class citizens by the academic staff and leadership and very little voice in strategy and business decision. Since Bain Consulting came around, layoffs are plentiful and often. Many, many good professionals who have contributed a ton to the success of the school have been riffed for either budgetary or political reasons. They are followed out the door by people like myself that are disgusted by what has been happening and don't trust that they will be next on the list. So there has been a serious talent drain from the staff as of late. Unfortunately, the people go away but the work does not. Everyone is expected to do more with less. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there was always a lack of budget and resources to do your job at the level one would expect from such a prestigious school. I had many times when I was lucky to get paper clips and printer toner when I needed it. Pay is much lower than market. Health insurance is now extremely expensive and covers less than before. My advice? Like the job you take, because there will be very little chance for advancement and promotion."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "great environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Jul 2015", "job_title": " in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "there are lots of high quality researches, and work that is going at SMU. the well-knowledge faculty who have defined some fundamental research work and employed talened students.", "cons": "Southern Methodist University is a private school cause limited sources for supoorting the projects and funding the students.
