Some of my coworkers were fantastic. This job taught me immense patience and an understanding that management will not always have your back, so to look out for yourself.", "cons": "Where to even begin. I\u2019ve been attacked physically and verbally by patients, then dismissed by management as \u201cwell it\u2019s part of the job\u201d. While the lowest paid staff members are dealing with violent patients biting, scratching, kicking, spitting, swearing, punching, and even breaking bones, management usually hides off the unit, only to come out when the coast is clear. There were times that I was so stressed that my body started reflecting the changes. I lost 15 lbs and hormonal, stress-related changes took its toll. \r\nBut that\u2019s not even a surprise. The biggest surprise to me was how staff treated each other. The backstabbing, gossip, humiliation and absolute cruelty that goes on between certain nurses is astounding. During my time I\u2019ve heard disparaging comments about people\u2019s intelligence, sexuality, weight (this is a frequent one), English speaking ability, marital status, child bearing status, socio-economic class, perceived ability (or lack thereof), laziness, clothing choice (and the \u201ccheapness thereof\u201d), amongst many others. And this is only what I\u2019ve heard first hand. I\u2019ve heard things have happened that I wish were completely unimaginable. When I attempted to address these comments with HR, and encourage HR to ask almost everyone else their own stories (as I was unwilling to repeat here-say and those stories were far more interesting than my own), I was told \u201cit would be understandable if I had considered quitting\u201d, and asked if I had considered changing departments. It became absolutely clear that they considered me to be the problem, not the people that abused their undeserved powers and harassed other staff. \r\n\r\nEverything this company does is JUST to cover its own behind. If you\u2019re not willing to be a fall-man for anything bad that happens, don\u2019t take a job here. If you\u2019re not willing to be the center of harassment and ridicule if you refuse to take part in the cattiness and gossip that envelops this place, don\u2019t take a job here. If you\u2019re not willing to be completely ignored by most of management unless you suck up to them, don\u2019t take a job here. If you\u2019re not willing to have your schedule intentionally messed with when you bump heads with someone (and then have management ask what YOU could have done differently in that situation, ignoring the whole intentional-malicious-schedule-rearrangement), then don\u2019t work here. If you\u2019re not willing to have that SAME person \u201caccidentally\u201d sign you up to work Christmas Day, New Year\u2019s Day, and the day after thanksgiving, don\u2019t work here. \r\n\r\nOverall, this place is absurd. They have \u201crules\u201d about harassment and bullying, but refuse to follow through. A \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d? What a joke. They claim to be accepting and tolerant but is anything but. Any problem ends up being \u201caddressed\u201d with a solution involving just a pamphlet of where to find the employee assistance program (who, by the way, take weeks to even get back to you with some copy-pasted message about \u201cwow that sounds hard. Sorry.\u201d)\r\nI don\u2019t know about the rest of the hospital but, if you want to feel as though you have any shred of respect or autonomy, do NOT work in the behavioral health unit. Tech, nurse, or otherwise. If you like feeling like you\u2019re in Mean Girls, then maybe this is the place for you. \r\n\r\nAlso, I gave up even looking into pay discrepancies because the first time I brought it up, it became such a fight and we were discouraged from talking about each other\u2019s pay. We only received back pay from the time it was addressed to the time it was approved, and nothing more. But not sure what else to expect from a company which lays off hundreds of workers while the CEO maintains his million dollar bonuses and constantly gets ridiculous pay increases (but don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get a $0.05 cost of living adjustment and a free book every year!!!)\r\n\r\nTl;dr: don\u2019t work here.
