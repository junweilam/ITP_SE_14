Severe turnover issues.\n-Massive disconnect between management, faculty, and staff. Senior management is not aware and does not recognize the amount of work that staff does. \n-The benefits used to be good, but they used Covid as an excuse to cancel a lot of them. The retirement match is now 2% and unlikely to go above that. The annual (adjustment for inflation) raise is only 1%, and with inflation always being above 1%, you are actually experiencing a decrease in salary each year.\n-There is a massive issue of nepotism and favoritism. Managers will pull strings and make exceptions for their relatives who are employed or study at the university. Unless a manager really likes you, you will be treated poorly.\n- They say it is 35 hours work week but is it really? \n- No appreciation from your manager or upper management. They take you for granted.\n- Benefit discrimination depends on which office you work in. Other offices may get remote benefits and others get none.
