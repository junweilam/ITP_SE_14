The university had several opportunities with a few different clients and internal projects when I applied. Raises were attributed to coworker interactions which I felt was fair.", "cons": "There's bureaucracy and funding involved in raises. If the university did not have funding, you might not get a raise.\n\nI loved my coworkers and have nothing bad to say about them personally. My lead was nearing retirement age and did not have an educational background in the field. I felt that I was unable to gain mentorship here. We did not employ version control like Git. We did not employ unit tests or continuous integration. We did not employ code review. Every \"version\" pushed to production was a nightmare. And by \"pushed to production\", I mean we put it on a fileshare and consumers would launch whatever was on the fileshare.\n\nThere was rarely direction. No specifications for the software that was being made. I felt like I was tasked with building software that did everything for our client. Levels of abstraction would have been great. Instead we put it all in the same interface. I was forced to reach out to scientists and ask them what they specifically wanted. They don't speak computer science and I don't speak science. It's a difficult communication barrier to overcome. I'd ask what formula calculations they wanted automated and end up with a science lesson. Perhaps I should have been better acclimated to the science to have been in this position in the first place. The bottom line is, there were no hard specifications.\n\nThere was a lot of red tape. You might be tasked with making a web application to collect benchmarks of users. In a scientific study, you'll probably run into some data that falls under HIPAA. You can mitigate this, but management won't ever review your application and determine that everything is okay (or not). It will sit in purgatory forever. Need to host your web application online? Red tape. It'll never come to fruition. Higher ups will ask you why things aren't moving along. You'll explain and go back to your supervisor. The project will stagnate.\n\nGoing back to the lack of specifications thing, I'm reminded of a project. One particular web application where I needed pictures of \"healthy\" foods and \"unhealthy\" foods. Asking the scientist running the program did not yield any information. I loaded the unhealthy section with things like beer, burgers, and sweets. I filled up the \"healthy\" pictures with mostly vegetables. I had asked the scientist to sort the pictures for me, but they never did. Instead, I had them coming to me and saying that beer had particular health benefits and things like carrots have lots of sugar so they may not be \"healthy\". This was not my research. It was hers. Yet I was left to make these decisions myself or gain information piece by piece.\n\nYou'll probably get stuck doing tech support if your less abrasive than the tech support person."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "16 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Senior Director in Grand Forks, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Open environment with a lot of opportunities for growth.", "cons": "Small town which can lead to small town issues."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Not the best place to be", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Fellow in Grand Forks, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great health benefits for employees and their families", "cons": "Don't seem to care too much about retaining their employees"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Grand Forks, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "quite environment to work in", "cons": "very cold especially in winter"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good Student Employment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Oct 2022", "job_title": "UAS Flight Instructor in Grand Forks, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy to schedule time around classes", "cons": "Pressure of completing flight lessons with lesser motivated students"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great community, low budget", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Teaching Assistant in Grand Forks, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful, caring faculty.
