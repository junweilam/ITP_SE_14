Plus, being a pediatrics hospital, the staff are super compassionate and and the culture is family oriented. I think the field of pediatrics just naturally draws energetic, kind and compassionate people to these types of organizations.  From the executive level and through all departments, every meeting agenda and discussion is focused on how to provide exceptional care for our patients. There is a team atmosphere here that encompasses all specialties and roles towards improving care. It's a  truly multicultural, multidisciplinary approach towards the pursuit of excellent care and services. I also love that the organization demonstrates equability for job advancements. If you demonstrate exceptional leadership skills, innovative thinking ,  taking initiative,  great communication skills and an ability to bring a team together to work towards a common goal, you will  do well and will fit in with this organization.

PCH is an organization that is accredited by Joint Commissions and as their requirements evolve, patient safety initiatives evolve, healthcare reimbursements/culture evolves, and federal & state regulations change, you MUST be able to evolve your practices or process as well! You have to be resilient and creative to meet ever changing priorities. You have to be able to take initiative when you see that processes can be enhanced. You have to work well as part of a multidisciplinary team and engage in effective and considerate dialog with a variety of teams. \"if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together\". No where is that philosophy more true than at PCH.  The work we all do impacts, either directly or indirectly, the care provided to our patients. This is why it is imperative that when progress is being discussed, for any issue, all teams involved in providing that service MUST be able to discuss the barriers and the successful practices that are specific to their department or specialty. Thus when a new program or process is rolled out, it will be effective and efficient for the services impacted by the change. Again, none of this seems like a deficit to me but for some potential applicants, perhaps it is. Working towards and obtaining multidisciplinary buy in, for any project, is consistently practiced at PCH. Again, I love this aspect of working at PCH because it gives me an opportunity to voice my concerns or lend my opinion on new practices that impact my contribution to the overall mission and vision. Finally, again, for me not a weakness but other's may not be too excited about: You will stay busy! There is no such event as a \"lazy day\" here! You have to be super organized, ready for changing priorities and focused on getting the job done! I've been here for nearly a decade and have never had a \"quiet\" day. It's all hassle and bustle to meet deadlines, enact change, re-prioritize and to serve the patients, families and colleagues who rely on you for whatever resources  you provide. Every day there is a new challenge or variation or change in practice that needs to be addressed so there is never a dull moment.
