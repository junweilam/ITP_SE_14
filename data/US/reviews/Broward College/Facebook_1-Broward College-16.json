If you advance to a higher position or another department, the pay is still much lower than average/ other higher education employers. They give you annual evaluations and goals to meet, but never a raise. You might get lucky and they will throw you a couple hundred bonus chump change, but it fluctuates based on how management is feeling. They will force you to take their health insurance plan, or require you to show them proof that you have it elsewhere in order to decline. The coworkers that are in the same boat as you, are usually great to work with because they all share the same complaints with working for BC. Unfortunately there is a Clique culture and the upper management have favorites, and the rest cannot even use vacation time without reprimand. Don't bother asking for schedule accommodations, people that have been there for 10+ years have been let go for those requests. This place used to be great, but has become a revolving door for employees. If you are dealing with irate students, too bad. They don't care for your safety. They only care about appearances. They have literally had police on campus because a student announced they had a gun, but still decided to tell employees that they had to stay on campus and continue working. They didn't send out a picture or description of the student or even allow staff to go home, and shut down the campus until the student was detained. Even if you have issues with another employee, they only care if you actually get assaulted. If you have a question and need to speak with your supervisor, they will literally leave you on read, and get around to you later, most of the time it's days later. This happens 100% of the time. Meanwhile management will share vacation photos to lavish places that you could never afford because they won't pay you enough, yet rub it in your face they line their own pockets with six figures. The workload never ends and they will make sure they have extra \"projects\" to keep you busy if the micro-management doesn't think your working hard enough for the chump change they give you for pay. As for working for higher education, you might assume they value employees that want to obtain degrees while working at BC, but they say your work comes first, and you cannot take classes if it interferes with your work schedule. Remember, they won't accommodate, even if they can - they choose not to. If it's your birthday or special occasion they will tell you happy birthday through chat, but if it's a supervisors birthday/ wedding anniversary/ birth of their cousin, they will literally ask you to pitch in money to send gifts/ flowers/ etc. Management will only speak to you because they are obligated to say hi when passing by, or you've done something to upset them/ not working hard enough. They will also pit you against other coworkers and ask you to snitch on them if they are late/ not working. Unless that person is part of the clique and is allowed to get away with anything. When a supervisor sees that you have made a mistake, they will announce it in a meeting - in a way that makes it seem like you're incompetent and you're a child. They will also say that they don't have enough money in the budget for basic office supplies, yet buy the entire office god-awful (cheaply made) blazers that you cannot wear elsewhere because they printed your name on the front. They also force you to share desks with other employees, as well as double check your coworkers work. If you recently worked with someone who had COVID at the time and you might have been infected, they won't tell you. They won't even do the courtesy of saying go get tested just in case.
