From direct care to local management through the administrative offices, when a client requires more services, greater attention and changes to their care, absolutely everyone is dedicated to make sure that person gets what they need as quickly as possible.  Direct care staff work exceptionally hard to maintain a high level of care to the residents.  They are professional, caring and dedicated to improving the lives of some very challenging people.  The facilities are very well maintained.  With the Portland Metro area, CCS has a dedicated maintenance team that handles repairs and landscaping.  The programs are well-lit, well decorated and there\u2019s a strong effort to make the facilities as home-like and welcoming as possible.\r\n\r\nNeither Good/Bad: Their benefits are largely in-line with other agencies within the city and state.  They have self insured vision and dental benefits, which requires paying out of pocket in advance.  If you live in the Portland area, you are given a number of health insurance options.  If your program is rural, you may be stuck with a single, more expensive option.  The agency matches to the 403b at a much higher rate than I\u2019ve participated previously.", "cons": "The Bad: ColumbiaCare Services is based out of Medford, whereas the overwhelming majority of its programs are in the Portland Metro area.  The vast majority of the agency\u2019s executive administration, clinical management, HR, support services and billing are in Medford.  Because of this, there is a culture of very poor communication and oversight from a distance at all levels.  Everyone outside of the administrative office is overwhelmingly aware of this on a cellular level.  Everyone can tell in which ways it adversely affects everything from the culture of the agency, expectations placed onto local area program administrators through how direct care staff feel supported.  The agency has attempted to manage this distance by back filling in middle management positions, staff and out-of-the-way facilities.  At best, perhaps its trickle down effect will somehow aid the clients.  At worst, the middle manager hired to project manage from afar is unreasonably distant and introduction to her peers is a powerpoint filled with pictures of her dog.  Overall, there are several byproducts which the agency seemingly doesn\u2019t care about or at least, fails at responding to appropriately.\r\n\r\nDirect care staff are under-supported.  Any wage changes made by the agency are most often a reaction to how far out of line they may be paying their staff.  People most often leave their jobs here not because the clients are difficult or the program culture doesn\u2019t match - It\u2019s because almost anywhere else starts at a higher rate of pay.  In this economy, the bottom line is how much they pay and because of this, finding applicants is very difficult.  Merit raises rarely happen and if they do, it\u2019s a minimal change.  At their anniversary with the agency, staff are supposed to receive an annual review and depending on their performance, raises can be recommended by the program admin.  If the admin is overwhelmed by their job, these reviews can be completed and possessed months late, which prevents direct care staff from their deserved bump in pay.\r\n\r\nLocal area administrators are under-supported.  The programs that receive the majority of attention and support are those that are starting up (makes sense), programs that are failing on some level (makes sense) and those whose administrators are favored by the admin office (doesn\u2019t make sense).  Typically these favorited admins are toxic to their direct care staff, unknowingly undermine attempts at programs successes and have little interaction and knowledge of their clients.  Outside of these examples, all of program administrators face major burnout.  This can be from the lack of staffing options which forces them to work overnight shifts, having to cover communication from theirs and other facilities 24/7 and other day to day challenges.  Their exec-level supervisors have absolutely no interest in hearing it.  Monthly supervision with the administrative office is an opportunity to make sure the program isn\u2019t facing a lawsuit, being shut down or facing a catastrophic issue.  It\u2019s supervision in name only and doesn\u2019t leave the local admin feeling successfully listened to or supported.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly: This agency wastes a lot of money!  Previously, CCS has administrator conferences twice a year at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars each.  Local area admins would be put up in reasonably nice hotels for days a time, treated to expensive banquet dinners with open bars and would be run through powerpoint presentations and lectures by senior administration.  Through expansive clip-show Apple-made feel good movies, the conference reads more like a cheerleading rally to make the administrative office feel like its making an impact.  Program admins more often feel their time is being wasted.  As nice as it may be to participate and be wined/dined, almost none of it is necessary.  CCS\u2019 administrators are typically down to earth people who\u2019d rather be left to do their job than be separated from the facilities and family.  Rather than spend tens of thousands on these events, the agency should set up similar events for direct care staff, such as a company-wide field day and bbq, direct staff specific catered retreats or appreciation days.  They do so much extraordinary work and rarely receive the thanks they deserve!\r\n\r\nLastly, the executive level team receive extraordinarily high compensation.  In 2015, Trillium\u2019s total revenue was $25 million and their CEO made $274k as their annual salary.  In that same year, CCS\u2019 total revenue was a little under $24 million and the president\u2019s annual salary was more than $430k.  The other exec team members\u2019 compensation isn\u2019t as high as this, but its consistently higher than other comparable providers.  As all of these organizations are non-profits, everyone can easily examine and compare details by Googling \u201cpropublica columbiacare services\u201d.

In reading other reviews, other line staff have run up against working with senior staff and administrators who were/are poor leaders.  In working at half dozen different sites, there's no shortage of stories of bad administrators - One who fired almost half of their staff upon being hired, being backed up by HR and were then themselves found to be the cause of the problem; one who refused to complete years-worth of treatment plans and instead would sext with their out of town boyfriend, while letting sensitive paperwork stack in drifts around his office. Line staff are easier to build a case against firing, especially if other co-workers don't work well with them.  It's harder (and more likely expensive) to attempt the same with administrators.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly: The corporate culture has a huge blind spot and communication divide because it's based in Medford and more than 85% of the facilities are in the Portland-Metro area.  That separation and its cascading effect touches everything from hiring/training, facility cultures, hiring problematic staff and then managing them from a distance, attitudes towards line staff, \"being visible\", etc.  The agency HQ directs itself without any good feedback on how its decisions effect others and the end effect is ignorance at best, lack of care/disregard at worst.  Most communication from them eventually sounds like disingenuous cheerleading, sending emails and feel-good videos that look to back-pat more than celebrate front lines successes.  As line staff, this feels like \"Medford\" is remarkably out of touch with everything and the only people we can count on are our local admins, who themselves are doing well but are regularly rolling their eyes at what is asked of them -or- administrators who kiss up to their supervisors from afar, while slowly eroding all trust in their line staff."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Company needs to look forward and get current with research", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Dec 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Medford, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They manage to hire really caring hard working people.

One of the sayings I heard over the years, that resonated with me the most, was from the late Executive Director Bob Becket. He often said, \u201cwhen in doubt, do the right thing\u201d. In my almost three years at ColumbiaCare, I have held two positions in two separate programs and I cannot think of a single instance in which the leadership or staff failed to follow Bob\u2019s guidance. I have worked through countless tough situations with clients and have always seen the staff and leadership put the need of the client above everything else. As a front-line staff member, I have been given incredible support by the leadership. I have never felt like I couldn\u2019t come to my supervisor with concerns. The few times I did need to voice a concern, I was shown genuineness and felt validated while we worked through the issue together. I have felt empowered and respected by leadership when given the freedom to case manage the way that works for me and my clients without micro-managing. One of the most unique elements of ColumbiaCare is the staff\u2019s desire to see our clients get better, no matter what their job is. Outside of direct client care, our maintenance staff is passionate about maintenance because they know that the work they do improves the people\u2019s lives in our programs. Our IT staff work quickly and effectively knowing that each moment a system is down can have a negative impact on the services we provide. Seeing everyone\u2019s passion to help our clients from the clinical staff to the nonclinical is remarkable.
