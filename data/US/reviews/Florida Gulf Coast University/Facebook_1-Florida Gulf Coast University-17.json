They keep the money only for a particular department that has so called \"programmers\", yet they have never created any application. they \"programmers\" simply manage already built programs from third parties, and if there are issues with the program they simply contact the vendor to fix it. Other than having that particular group as their favorite to pool money into, upper management enjoys the bulk of the budget, fattening their pockets and living a grand lifestyle, while their hardest working team (Networking and Help Desk) get below national average pay. They enjoy having their whole infrastructure redone, refreshed, upgraded, redesigned, and maintained well for next to no expenditure on their engineers. They benefited off working their network team like slaves while paying them next to nothing. They've even ostracized their network team by removing them from the building where the whole IT department is, and put them in a completely different building to be forgotten about. They will smile in your face, say nice things to your face, even pay for your lunch once in a while (which is pennies when you're making well over six figures a year), but truly they look at talented, hard working individuals as a threat. They have a clique coined the \"Mafia\", which, if you're not part of, consider yourself just a peon. It's unfortunate how they treat their most talented employees there in the IT department. This is the reason why 3/5 of their engineers up and left recently, and several others in other departments. If you are a minority, and talented, I strongly suggest you steer clear of this particular department at FGCU; they will view you as less than and drain you of all of your energy by working you hard and choosing not to pay you your worth. Almost all of the minorities at FGCU's BTS department quit because management refused to pay them their worth, and or refused to give them the position that they worked hard to try to achieve; this is not an exaggeration, so take it however you want, I'm just being transparent and trying to save other minorities from going through what the rest have been through. They show no remorse, nor professionalism; their motto is, if you leave we'll just replace you. What they don't seem to understand is that, it's not easy to replace talent. They will soon learn though. Otherwise, I enjoyed my time working for the organization as a whole, I gave it my whole heart and effort, I really looked forward to helping them move forward technical wise, but I realize BTS did not see my worth and value, and they disregarded all of the efforts, late nights, coming in on my off days, drenched clothes from working in many non HVAC IDFs, willingness to help any time and in any way that I could, completed every single project they gave me with little to no issues, etc. It's a truly disappointing situation that I experienced there, I never worked for such greedy management who seek to compensate certain groups that they favor, and overlook the group that would have the most vital part of helping the organization move forward in the digital age. Upper management is known for making promises to your face, and going against their word once the conversation is done. Lack of professionalism would be an understatement. I would never consider working for the management I worked for over there ever in my life; I do however enjoyed working for FGCU as a whole."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Excellent Work Place With Great People", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Director of Academic Advising in Fort Myers, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues, physical location, employment benefits", "cons": "Bureaucracy, limited resources, long hiring process"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Absolutely Awful", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Resident Assistant in Fort Myers, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free housing and a biweekly stipend.

There is also a wide gap between faculty pay. Some faculty barely make $350,000 while others are paid over $100,000.
