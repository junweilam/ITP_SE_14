From having someone in the senior management team look over my resume to having folks help Corps members interview for grad school. They do care. One of my best friend now works at an amazing nonprofit in the same college access field! I even had the space to form a curriculum workgroup and essentially, worked it into existence. There's space for critical thinking, creativity and taking on innovative projects.", "cons": "Sure, there were some bumps. Do I enjoy having a dress code? No. (I was hyper annoyed with the nazi-esque approach from a particular person about wearing pins) BUT, Is that part of being in a workforce? Yes. First and foremost, I care about education. All other issues were negligible and fell to the back burner. I understand that part of being in a working environment means dressing professional and setting the example for my students. And that's OK with me. An advice for College Forward is bringing on board people who truly care about education, and who have the drive and spirit to carry it out.\r\n\r\nAlso, Diversity training is needed. Savior complex could be full-blown sometimes. Everybody seemed to take on different \"social justice\" causes but were unaware of their own privileges (which detracted from the work that we did for our students.)"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good mission & work, issues w/ organization", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Jul 2015", "job_title": "College Access Coach in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was a College Access Coach. Working with the students is definitely the best part about this AmeriCorps position. The work that this organization does is beneficial in the communities it serves. The program allows for a lot of freedom for the coach to assist students in whatever way that seems appropriate, based on the needs of the assigned school and students. The environment of so many young people makes for an energetic work environment. It's great to work with people who are motivated to help students succeed.\r\n\r\nAs AmeriCorps members, this job can be a great launching pad to go into teaching or higher education jobs (admissions, financial aid, academic support services, etc).", "cons": "Full time staff seem to have a severe retention issue. The lack of retention of full time staff, as well as AmeriCorps staff, results in the loss of knowledge and skills that may have been developed during a person's time there. Efforts to develop the program by employees are, in a way, short-lived as a result of the lack of retention of all but the higher level staff members; once a person has the experiences from which to build an idea of what could be done better, he or she leaves. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Houston office, specifically, there is a large disconnect from the primary Austin office. Visits by upper staff members seem more ceremonial than productive or interactive, program resources are not shared effectively between the two offices, and (although it has improved recently) there has been an unfortunate habit of Austin office members to forget about or postpone concern of the needs of the Houston office. The result of these issues, I feel, is that members have less of a voice in the organization and do not feel that they are as equipped to succeed as ATX members might be.\r\n\r\nTraining for coaches is somewhat brief and could be developed further to increase the knowledge and effectiveness of coaches."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Meaningful Work, Unique Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 May 2014", "job_title": "Program Manager in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "College Forward provided a very unique and accepting organizational culture.

I also had the honor of having incredibly supportive managers who challenged us, affirmed us, and made sure that we knew that our voices and ideas mattered. This I cannot stress enough was invaluable to me, and one of the only reasons I stayed. My immediate co-workers and team members were an immensely strong support system and network of people who were driven and passionate. I found that many people were interested in or open to learning about social justice, and creating a safe and supportive space. This community looked out for one another, supported each other in times of great sadness and grief,  made sure that everyone was taken care of and even when we disagreed on issues, respected and valued one another. We created a family there, and that I can say was one of my most precious aspects of working at this organization. I would 100% do this again if I were with all of these people again, if I had my students and the community that we had. It was full of love, and couldn't have asked for better people in my life.", "cons": "While the managers and AmeriCorps members were dedicated to creating community and seeking justice for our students, people within our senior management overwhelmingly ignored these crucial aspects of our work. While they will tirelessly preach to you about graduation rates, big audacious goals, and what incredible work they are doing, they ignore many of the real issues going on. You cannot address education inequalities and not talk about intersecting forms of oppression; race, gender, socio-economic status and more importantly you can't address these things without also talking about privilege. In other posts you see language like \"white savior complex\", and that is a repeated pattern for a reason. Conversations we had with senior management about these crucial issues (if had at all) were surface level to say the least, and for the most part suppressed when brought up. Many of my coworkers created groups and shared ideas on how to address different issues facing our students, and though our senior management listened to what we had to say, these proposals seemed to go in one ear and out the other. Despite tireless work done by our managers and AmeriCorps members to follow up, to communicate, to try and build something meaningful for our students, were swiftly dropped, forgotten about, dismissed by senior management. Part of the reason the Corps members protected one another so fiercely was because we certainly did not feel supported by senior management or that they would jump to our defense. There was a strong sense of \"us vs. them\" within the office, which is never a sentiment you want to feel towards those leading you.\r\n\r\nThough change comes slowly and no organization or movement is perfect, no one was expecting that of them. Most of us simply wanted to have a conversation, to be recognized and have our voices heard. Instead, we felt shoved aside, sometimes ignored, other times completely invisible. They (hopefully) made some important changes  surrounding pro-nouns and different hiring practices, but were deceitful when it came to other changes we proposed. They ignored requests for transparency, or placated us by telling us changes, budgets or support were on the way when they simply were not. \r\n\r\nThough senior management cares about the students, they seem to do the opposite of what is in the best interest of the organization. Their is something crumbling within the foundation of the organization, and if not addressed the foundation of this house will continue to rot, will continue to disintegrate and they will continue to witness high rates of staff discontent and turn over."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Development Coordinator", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Gave you the reigns to develop a project start to finish\r\nFull placed trust in my decision making\r\nAllowed to work in different departments\r\nRewarded hard work and result-driven outcomes\r\nWorked with amazing students and dedicated employees\r\nUnapologetically advocated for higher education policies\r\nEncouraged personal time off and had PTO", "cons": "Multiple project management with different authoritative figures"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Student", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Fullerton, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to learn Get a degree", "cons": "Expensive The parking was oye, qu\u00e9 hora es?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Nice environment but feeling stagnant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Jun 2023", "job_title": "IT Help Desk in Fullerton, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great coworkers, lots of interaction with students and staff, community atmosphere, active", "cons": "customers can sometimes be difficult, not much opportunity for upward mobility in first couple years"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It\u2019s great", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Jun 2023", "job_title": "COVID TESTER in Fullerton, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is Flexible and easy", "cons": "Unfortunately there is No benefits when you\u2019re part time"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Tutoring Job for Students", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Tutor in Fullerton, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In this job, you get to tutor other students in a subject of your choice, for me it was mainly mathematics.
