If leadership is poor, your only real choice is to get out. Resources for conflict resolution are so ineffective that they may as well be non-existent, and HR is either unable or unwilling to do anything to correct or remove bad managers. (It's easier to just treat problems as isolated incidents caused by personality conflicts, changes in management, etc., rather than seriously address toxic work environments or admit that perhaps someone was hired or promoted  who should not have been.)\r\n\r\nAside from that, WSU is very remote.  It's an ok area if you like small-town living and have family and friends nearby, but you are likely to get bored if you're moving from elsewhere and travel to and from is a hassle. Lastly, be prepared for a tough housing market. Rents are high for such a small place (because of the university) and rental properties are plagued by bad management used to dealing with college students. The real estate market heavily favors sellers. And in both cases, vacancies follow the academic year. Renters and buyers better have a place under contract by April at the latest - apartments get snapped up by incoming students and houses literally sell in a matter of days once summer comes."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Spokane, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Professional development, friendly and collaborative work environment", "cons": "Need more student housing, access to childcare is limited (in Spokane campus)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "I enjoy working at WSU.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Pullman, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, easy to work with.", "cons": "There are no cons working for WSU."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good student job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Student Manager in Pullman, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule.

Low funding and RA salary since school culture are more focused on football than research. Also, all libraries close at 10 pm or before, and there is nowhere to work beside your apartment or a bar. If you are a foreign Ph.D. student you will have a miserable time as you will be trapped there with no opportunities to get out. I saw brilliant graduate students being intellectually suffocated in this place over a year or two. And most of them had issues finding jobs in their field and ended up as a programmer. You'd better have a really good reason and an appropriate personality to go there besides just loving your work. So think twice if you pack your luggage and move to Pullman.\r\n\r\nBut if you decided to go there, I suggest you do MS level studies in engineering, business, or veterinary.
