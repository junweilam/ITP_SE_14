Actually, to say this place is a university is a joke.  They have no regional accreditation and the credits earned there will not transfer to any other legitimate school if a student decides Grantham is not for them. There is a culture of competition among the management, as they know that the smallest flaw will have them being shown the door, therefor, employees are regularly scapegoated by managers as they look to cover their own butts. If you are looking for a job in IT, this is not the place to get it.  Save yourself time and look elsewhere, especially if you are a software developer. The manger is a little weasel and cannot be trusted at all. In fact, if you interview with him and his team, just be prepared for a \"gotcha\" interview in which they will try to make things as hard for you as possible.  I always wondered why they got so much joy out of that... Additionally, if you decide to come to this waste of a business as a software dev, you'll have fun, developing software that will put people out of their jobs, because downsizing is all this place is about. They won't even provide paper cups for coffee or water in the break rooms because they have gone \"green\". Doesn't sound like a stable company to me.  Anyway, Grantham has a well documented history of discrimination as you will see in other reviews about this \"school\". I remember a time when the president of the \"school\" said in a company meeting that he would like to know who is Native American.  Some raised their hands and then he proceeded to ask them to do a rain dance because it had been so dry.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing. If you are any race other than white, or gay, pass on this joke of a \"school\". There are better opportunities out there and I found mine.
