PMHNPs Do not function in the capacity of the nurse practitioners that they are trained and licensed as. They are not permitted to make diagnostic/ treatment decisions on their own. Every decision must be reviewed ad nauseam and decided upon  by the physician. Additionally, the physicians dump all the work on the NPs- SO, the NP makes no decisions and Carries out all the work while the physicians sit around and play/talk on their cell phones and take care of personal business. Take note, this  will absolutely be your day on the psychiatry unit if you choose to work here. You will be told that the unit is like \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cwe all support each other,\u201d \u201cwe celebrate each others birthdays,\u201d etc, etc. They will paint a beautiful picture & tell you anything-  but take heart, nothing could be further from the truth. NPs are subjected to  abusive treatment that is condescending, controlling, belittling, & passive aggressive, & you will be deceived. Multiple NPs have been subjected to routine gaslighting. This treatment has left them feeling beat down & fearful. They cannot keep any NPs in the psychiatry dept for more than a few months due to the treatment. What matters here is the \u201chierarchy.\u201d The patients do NOT come first, the physicians egos do. In addition to all this, NPs  have to take a salary cut in order to come work here ( & NPs are willing to do so with the glossy picture they paint).  It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a new grad, or have years of experience, they don\u2019t care, everyone gets the same pay. Why would anyone want to work for less money, in an abusive environment, where the work is not allocated fairly, your experience counts for nothing, and you cannot even function as what you are trained and licensed as?

Vast majority of employees are long-time local - meaning management mistreats and  runs over their workers with little regard, on the assumption they aren't going anywhere. Corporate politics influence everything (think \"House of Cards\" in a healthcare setting), so managers and director level personnel must tread carefully. Even if you play the politics right but are high performance, someone will see you as a threat and as competition and try to neutralize you - so aim for mediocrity if you work here."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Telecomunications", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Telecommunications Technician in Gastonia, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent people to work for and with.

I watched shift managers double dose patients to keep them docile so they could surf the net, when I brought it to upper managements attention, the witch hunt started. I personally know of five nurses who diverted in the units, one turned herself in, two were caught, one quit and one died. Yeah, thats right, instead of stepping in, management allowed her to divert until she OD'd. Again, all this from myself and 9 other nurses fell on deaf ears. Interesting how none of that nine is still there.\r\n\r\nNurses were sleeping with doctors in the break rooms, nurses were writing their won narcotics orders and shift management was taking assignments so their pets could go get their hair done.

I am a 20+ year critical care veteran and having worked at Duke, ECU, CMC, Presby, MD Anderson and some of the nations better facilities, I can honestly tell you, it does not. I stayed in bedside nursing as a travel nurse for another four years after leaving this place. But no assignment, not even Hawaii, could get the bad taste out of my mouth.
