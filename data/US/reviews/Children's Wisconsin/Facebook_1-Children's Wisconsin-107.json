I worked hard to get the position and was ready to learn and do well as a CT technologist. I thought training was going fine until about 5 weeks into working there, I was told I was behind and my manager was 'very concerned'. I asked what I could have done better or what I could work on to get up to speed and wasn't given a straight answer, multiple times. I was only told to 'be more engaged and proactive.' I did everything I could in the following three weeks. Took extensive notes, asked for constant feedback (90% of the time it was positive), and scanned independently as much as possible. I figured with the feedback I was receiving, everything was fine. Little did I know, since no one decided to tell me, I was apparently FIVE weeks behind on training and where I should be. Once again my manager was of no help and resorted to threatening me of getting fired. There was no more I could do to improve. My question was, why didn't something happen sooner to ensure I would finish training on time? Why after three of training wasn't I told I wasn't up to speed yet, and asked what could be done to fix things and improve on things? Those were things not done. I was set up for failure. I felt as if I was thrown into the position and told to, 'figure it out'. I was also told I didn't know certain terms and things about the scanners which made me behind to. When I told my manager that no one had brought up those terms and I had no idea that I needed them, I was answered with, 'Someone MUST have mentioned them at least once. Maybe you don't remember.' No. I remember them NOT mentioning it. The topic was brushed away making me feel like it was my fault for just not 'knowing' that I needed to know all that. No help was offered to improve my skills and I was told that I was most likely going to be fired because I wasn't learning fast enough and they couldn't give me more training time even though I was only half way through training. It was a joke and I decided to resign.
