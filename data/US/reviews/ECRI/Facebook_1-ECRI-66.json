There's a lot of very smart and hard-working people at ECRI, including some world-class experts in certain areas, and lots of others who are bringing their valuable clinical or technical or other professional experience into the policy world and trying very hard to make a change in the world of patient safety.  Also, on the \"pro\" side, the org. is - at least for me, as I have worked in a lot of corporate environments - not a terribly rigid or high pressure place to work; there are plenty of deadlines,  but at the same time most of my co-workers and my manager are reasonable people who want to work together collegially and there is not a sense that your head is on the chopping block if you legitimately can't make a particular deadline.  People help each other, people want to get the job done, managers help you juggle and prioritize. There is not a lot of corporate-style politics or drama, at least in my department. On the other hand, that may be a \"con\" as well, as there are some areas of the organization that are simply not particularly productive, and I am suspecting that under the new CEO, there may be more stress for some people than they're used to.  Other pros: flexible work hours; pretty campus, though isolated; casual dress; work from home option in some circumstances. Managers generally pretty reasonable about accommodating personal situations in terms of work/life balance.", "cons": "Okay, the cons. The culture at ECRI is VERY strange, and for me it was an enormous adjustment. I've worked a lot of places, but never anywhere as odd as this place. As a couple of other reviewers have said, there are a lot of smart but eccentric people here, and in some cases, that's putting it kindly.  My department was, until quite recently, SILENT, and some people are still simply rude and cold. Some attribute it to lack of social skills, I really still can't quite fathom it. There are a few people who behave downright bizarrely. Often they are long-timers or in some cases very young people who have never worked anywhere else and apparently don't realize their behavior would not cut it most places. I really don't know what explains this; I think it's just that ECRI is a unique organization and has grown into what it is organically - always going its own way because it has no other real \"peers\" who do exactly the same work. Certain things that management apparently does not see are simply crazy, are deep rooted.  FWIW, it took me a VERY long time to feel comfortable here. I do, finally, and feel that I have friends as well as a sense of belonging in the structure and contributing positively to worthwhile work. But it sure wasn't easy.  Other cons: All cubicles - really, ALL - gray walls, not a lot of natural light, bunkerish feel to the building - quite frankly, a bit prison-like. (The windows are prison-style slits.) No way to get there by public transportation, nowhere to walk to for lunch or anything else - there's a catering service that supplies lunches but they're not very varied. I personally hate the corporate-office-park setting even though there's a large green lawn, and next door is a cemetery where you can walk if you want. To summarize the main \"cons\": weirdest place I ever worked. ECRI does things how ECRI does them, and the newcomer will just have to get used to it. Of course, now we have a new CEO and he may turn the place upside down and shake out the people who can't adjust. I will not be surprised if there are major upheavals. Oh, and the pay stinks."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good place to work at if you're not in IT", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Plymouth Meeting, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Sense of purpose.\r\nCasual working environment, work from home options (sometimes).\r\nDecent salary and benefits.", "cons": "Working in IT is a very negative, punishing envirenment.  \r\nVery black/white thinking.
