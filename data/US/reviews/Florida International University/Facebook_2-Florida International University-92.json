valuable work experience after completing your undergraduate degree. As a recent graduate, starting your career at FIU can provide a wealth of opportunities to learn and grow in a supportive and dynamic environment. Another benefit of working at FIU is the flexibility offered by their hybrid work arrangement. This allows employees to work both from home and in the office, giving them the ability to work in a way that suits their personal preferences and lifestyle. This can be especially advantageous for those who have family or other commitments that require flexibility in their work schedule. Moreover, the management at FIU is known for being understanding and accommodating in the event of unforeseen circumstances or emergencies. This means that you can be assured that your employer will support you when you need it most, which can be incredibly reassuring and help you to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Finally, working at FIU means that you won't have to worry about being micromanaged, which can be a huge relief for those who prefer to work independently. This allows you to take ownership of your work and be creative and innovative in your approach, which can be incredibly fulfilling and lead to career advancement opportunities. In summary, working at FIU offers numerous benefits for recent graduates, including valuable work experience, a flexible work arrangement, supportive management, and the freedom to work independently. All of these factors make it an excellent choice for those looking to start their careers.", "cons": "While there are many positive aspects to working at FIU, there are also some potential downsides to consider. One of the most significant cons of working at FIU as an instructional designer is the limited ability to work from home fully. Despite the job primarily requiring computer work and minimal phone or in-person interaction, FIU does not allow employees to work remotely indefinitely. This lack of flexibility may be frustrating for some, especially those who may have other obligations that make commuting to work difficult. Additionally, FIU's policies regarding compensation and promotions may be a source of concern for some employees. Specifically, the lack of raises and the potential for outside hires to be offered higher positions than existing employees may feel unfair and demotivating. This can be especially frustrating for employees who have invested significant time and effort into the job and gained valuable experience. Overall, while FIU may be a good starting point for recent graduates, the limited ability to work from home fully and the lack of opportunities for career advancement may make it less appealing as a long-term career option. Employees may need to consider whether they are willing to accept these limitations or if they should look for other opportunities that offer more flexibility and potential for growth."},

Very little support for safe working environments for women and female scientists/researchers/faculty/staff. If a problem with a supervisor or mentor was reported, it was ignored or minimized. HR and Title IX officers were given no power to help trainees. AWED office was supportive, but power to assist women researchers was limited by higher administration. Multiple reports of harassment and bullying go nowhere. Either you get put on administrative leave or have to leave the university in the middle of your research project, due to a lack of protection by FIU. Ethical research was also not supported. Reports of research integrity concerns were delayed until you leave or are fired. If an inquiry does happen, it was a biased process that supports the person accused. Thus, the university allows federal research funds to be misused and research to be performed in unsafe environments for women. Female scientists and trainees also do not have an equal opportunity for promotion, and often aren\u2019t invited for interviews in some departments. Many male-dominated science departments still exist at FIU, and there is little opportunity for women to move into higher positions.

Alot of positions possess a great amount of independence with little to no oversight.", "cons": "The downside of FIU is that upper managements, directors, deans etc, do not know what their staff workers do on an everyday basis. Some management do not even know your work description and therefore recognition is not given and evaluations are a joke. There is a severe lack of structure at FIU and enforcement of a strategic plan.  \r\n\r\nBe careful as to which College you apply for, take a look at the number of employees, student to professor ratio etc, and before working at FIU try to speak to someone from within that department or college you are seeking employment. Not all is bad, but very few departments are worth it. It is a young university with lots of changes underway, if you are looking for work at a \"real university\" apply at a school in north or central Florida. \r\n\r\n FIU is like the mickey mouse of universities, the students treat it as an extension of high school and do not respect administration or staff. Some employees barely speak English and the customer service is severely lacking. \r\n\r\nThere are constant changes in restructuring departments and units overall and the university has been undergoing budget cuts for the past few years. There is an overall sense of instability and the common phrase spoken at FIU is \"we should be lucky we have a job.\" This goes to show that employees treat FIU as nothing more than a paycheck and they often do not speak up about problematic issues within their departments. \r\n\r\nThere is also a sense that there is lot of inside trading of information, employees do not feel comfortable seeking employment elsewhere in the university because \"everyone knows everyone.\"  Although a sense of community exists, it also works to your disadvantage. \r\n\r\nThere is a clear glass ceiling at FIU, my professionals at FIU take years to move up so to speak and each position requires way too much education to earn poor pay. For example, most coordinator positions start off at 34000-40000, with a MASTER's degree.  Then the raises are very low and some years you will not earn a raise. Luckily the univeristy just implemented a new evaluation process for the entire university, in the past it was up to your department to evaluate you based on ....their own standards if there were any. There is still a sense that you earn a raise if you \"friends\" with the HR person for your department. \r\n\r\nThere is also a terrible misuse of funds in some departments, some will use Foundation money to fund ridiculous items when instead those funds can be better used for scholarships, events etc. \r\n\r\nIf you are coming from a private sector job, you may hate FIU completely. Most employees find this place to be a \"good starter job\" and do not anticipate long term employment.  The people that rave about FIU are those who think FIU is the only university in the United States, remember FIU is the only public univeristy in south florida and the only other main choice is UM a private school with a spectular student body. Pretty much if you apply you will get in. There is rolling admission so it is hectic for working in admission and some students are admitted the first week of classes, sometimes after classes have started.\r\n\r\nFIU has potential, but it is far from being Worlds Ahead which is a new campaign to rebrand the image of the study body, faculty, staff and administrators. I think the new president of FIU is leading the university is a positive direction however there is a lot of cleaning house to do. \r\n\r\nThere are too many Modesto minded employees and finally the focus is moving toward the students."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Adjuncts receive little respect or consideration from students and university personnel", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 May 2012", "job_title": "Online Course Instructor in Miami, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you have the right department head, there are opportunities to create your own course as you see fit, particularly if you teach online courses.", "cons": "* Apathetic students who disregard information about deadlines and assignment requirements and still expect an A in the course.\r\n* Apathetic bureaucracy who seem unable to provide the most basic information or make it easily accessible.\r\n* Course technicians who disregard direct instructions or who fail to fulfill their responsibilities or who care more about conformity than what works best for the course.
