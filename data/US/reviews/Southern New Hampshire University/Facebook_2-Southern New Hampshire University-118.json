One my merged team alone, 5 people left within a 6-month period and some of them were long-time employees of the University.\r\n\r\nThere is not much room for growth at this University. They are constantly posting new jobs, but the problem is that there are so many employees looking to move out of Admissions or Advising that each position gets flooded with applicants.\r\n\r\nSome students treat staff/faculty terribly and the University does very little about it. They will tell you to fill out a dispute form or speak to someone on the Dispute Resolution team and nothing really ever comes of it."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "SNHU is a Joke", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 May 2023", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good extra money Decent Students", "cons": "Low pay and the university has become a diploma mill."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Nice", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Concord, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good support and training programs", "cons": "Limited number of course appointments"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Student Work Study in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing work environment, great experience, and great opportunity.", "cons": "I wish the pay was higher for work study students."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Glorified call center", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Academic Advisor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits are great, pay is less than needed to live.", "cons": "They talk the talk, but they don\u2019t walk the walk."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "SNHU a great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing culture, wonderful co-workers, remote work-from-home availability", "cons": "I cannot think of any cons."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Overall I enjoy it", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Admission Counselor I in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love SNHU itself, and our benefits are great.", "cons": "I don't enjoy my role and think pay should be higher"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Lab Assistant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Lab Assistant in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Make your own hours, can work on projects that are meaningful to you and can also work on school work at the same time.", "cons": "Not enough pay for peers that I put up with and have to fix their problems."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Definite pros and cons", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Student Finance Counselor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent benefits offered and work from home available", "cons": "Nearly impossible to get an official ADA accommodation.

With Covid there has been a massive shift of culture. SNHU is no longer the dream company where even if you were not paid well, at least you had a great organization and wholesome culture. Sadly many departments are massively overworked, under paid, not valued, and often times bullied by leadership. Executive leadership continues to change priorities and shift in \u201cfavorite\u201d departments. We were consistently asked to shift in our department goals so we could never truly produce quality work and only ever got to do rework. Sadly I think SNHU needs a wake up call and determine what they want ti accomplish over the next few years.

Every day feels like the whole operation is going to implode because it's run so poorly. The DOE needs to investigate.\r\nFirst off, everyone is micromanaged within an inch of their lives. Management can see what everyone is doing at all times and uses it against people for being human beings. Need to use the restroom? Better wait until your break even if it's 2 hours away because if you are not tethered to your desk it's a problem. Employees are pressured to work when they are sick or bereaved to make their leaders' numbers look better. Time off is not accounted for when metrics are measured, so everyone is expected to perform the same even if someone was out sick for a week.\r\nOther departments push their responsibilities onto Admission Counselors and when we speak up we are to \"assume good intentions\" and just take on the work rather than fixing the problem. This has created a culture where everyone knows they can get away with anything and no one does the right thing. Training is a joke - veteran employees provide the training and management does not understand the job so they are incapable of answering questions.\r\nLeadership is comprised of fake people whose actions don't even slightly match up with their words and people who refuse to address issues and instead just deny them forever while they grow. They tells us to \"challenge the status quo\" and then keep anyone down who could possibly have a positive impact on the status quo because you do not want to change. They prioritize smiling and conforming over actually performing, which is a detriment to the people who sign on to a lifetime of student debt to take classes at the school. They try to curate a culture where people are obsessed with working for them because they know they can't get quality work out of people for such little comparative compensation. It feels like a cult.\r\nFurthermore, they force admission counselors to register students who did NOT give permission to be registered, which has financial consequences if they are dropped for non-participation. They do this to people who have never even spoken with admission counselors on the phone or responded to an email. The admission portal is proving to be a great method to take financial advantage of people.\r\nDon't think admission is a foot in the door to go to another department either, those positions are extremely competitive because everyone wants to leave admission so it's really difficult to go elsewhere.\r\nI'm curious to know what the price was for the \"best college to work for\" title because if employees were asked we would be nowhere near that list."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Academic Advisor for COCE Branch", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Academic Advisor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was an academic advisor for the COCE branch--the branch that works with SNHU's online students.\r\n\r\nThe pros are the friendly people, from the top down.

Out of hundreds of calls, there is bound to be one less-than-perfect call.

Eight-week online undergraduate terms are stacked right on top of each other, often with no days off in between (one term ends on a Sunday and the next begins Monday) and only two days for instructors to submit final grades.  For the students, a regular semester-long course is condensed into eight weeks of learning (often six, with many classes setting aside one week for work on the final project and week 8 for course reflection). This may be fine for academically ambitious students, but that description does not fit most of the students in the course I have taught.\r\n\r\nFeels like you are being baby-sat while being asked to baby-sit. Your courses are watched by a team lead, who will email you if your participation in the discussion board is lower than usual one week, if you have even one assignment that has not been graded within 7 days, or if you have not entered a \"0\" for missing work within 2 days (even though students have an extra week to complete it).

Each term, I encounter multiple instances of plagiarism issues, ranging from citation/paraphrasing errors to outright full plagiarized assignments. On average, I deal with about half a dozen cases per eight-week term--and my classes are mostly juniors and seniors. Per the direction of the team leads, we're encouraged to use these as a \"teaching moment\" and allow the students to resubmit the work, without penalty,  and nothing is ever reported. I had one instance that was so egregious, and the student still would not acknowledge what she had done wrong after multiple communications, but when I asked my team lead if I could report it, I was told not to and to still give the student the opportunity to re-do the assignment.\r\n\r\nInstructors are course administrators, not teachers. The course content (assignments, discussion prompts, readings, etc.) are pre-set, which is fine, but often are poorly designed, unclear, or out of date. When students evaluate you at the end of the course, your evaluation may be negatively impacted by course features that you are powerless to change. Instructors are told to \"customize\" the course through the use of announcements, which in my experience a lot of the students do not read. Further, when you do take the time to provide custom instruction above and beyond expectations in these announcements (for example, I post recorded videos interviewing guest speakers), your team lead won't acknowledge this--but will email you if you only post 4 times in the discussion board one week instead of 6 (note that there is no official \"rule\" of how many times you are required to post, so the distinction between 4 and 6 is completely arbitrary)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "it is not worth the headache", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Adjunct Faculty in Worcester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "lots or reqs, lots of manipulation by sjw students who do not like the grade, the req, their \"feelings', etc. Advisors like to critique you and make demands, deans support students who pay you are expendable big time! if you have ZERO personality, views and obey well you will make approx $15.60 a wk per student. you are req to work 24/7.\r\n\r\nNO VACATION IN FIVE YRS", "cons": "lots or reqs, lots of manipulation by sjw students who do not like the grade, the req, their \"feelings', etc. Advisors like to critique you and make demands, deans support students who pay you are expendable big time! if you have ZERO personality, views and obey well you will make approx $15.60 a wk per student. you are req to work 24/7."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Dedicated to students, but not very supportive of faculty", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Online Adjunct Professor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They are dedicated to student success and urge faculty to reach out to students to help them succeed.

Where to  begin?\r\n\r\nFirst, let's begin with the bachelor's degree itself.  Any student who receives a bachelor's degree has accomplished something - absolutely, and any student who does this deserves to  be commended, it is an achievement to be sure.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, as most academics know, a bachelor's degree in and of itself does not confer automatic career potential as most bachelor's degrees in general are now considered the equivalent of a high school diploma; to REALLY have career advancement potential,  most students will need a graduate degree and therein lies the problem with SNHU and most other schools as well, I might add.\r\n\r\nThe problem? Insupportable \"baby sitting\" of students and beyond the pale \"hand holding\" of students.  Once upon a time, universities were seen as a place of learning and perhaps the single most important skill that CAN NOT be taught but rather, LEARNED, which is: critical thinking and critical analysis skills.\r\n\r\nSNHU (and many other schools as well) now expect instructors/professors to almost \"shepherd\" the student through their course work, almost acting as de facto \"parents\" being forced to constantly \"remind\" them of assignments, etc.\r\n\r\nNow, having said this, I DO understand that, especially with regards to introductory courses such as the one I am currently (thankfully) finishing for SNHU this might be necessary; however, SNHU's requirements go far beyond this in many ways which I will detail below.\r\n\r\nLet's be honest here: SNHU does students a tremendous disservice by all of this ridiculous \"hand holding\" for this simple reason: not only does it deprive the students of learning  how to think critically and solve problems ON THEIR OWN, but perhaps more importantly, it sets the students up for failure because if/when the student decides to pursue graduate school, the student will then (unfortunately) learn that the \"hand holding\" that they have been afforded as an undergraduate will NOT be in existence in graduate school, or, if it is, it will be at a vastly reduced capacity because by the time a student enrolls in graduate school it is expected that they have the academic rigor and intellectual capacity that is REQUIRED for graduate level work, full stop.\r\n\r\nIt's not that graduate professors don't care or won't be available for help, it's just that, they will expect the student to realize that they have assignments and will not spend time \"hand holding\" and \"checking in\"; the graduate student will have full responsibility and as a result, will pretty much be left on their  own.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, here are my thoughts about working as an adjunct for SNHU Online in the COCE (sounds impressive, doesn't it? Hint: it's really not):\r\n\r\nA \"virtual\" tsunami of grading; what does this mean, you might wonder?\r\n\r\nThe current eight week session is ending and I am beyond thankful and am frankly surprised I have managed to trudge my way through.\r\n\r\nI taught an introductory course with 28 students.  The course syllabus has, at minimum, 4 assignments PER WEEK (sometimes 5 assignments if you count the discussion board posts).\r\n\r\nYes, you read that right.\r\n\r\nFor EACH assignment for EACH student, the instructors are required to leave, at MINIMUM a paragraph of INDIVIDUALIZED feedback.\r\n\r\nYes, you read that right, too.\r\n\r\nNow, here is the caveat: if you happen to have a regular full time 40 hour a week job and think \"Hey, it would be nice to do a bit of teaching on the side\" either for extra money, enjoyment of teaching and imparting knowledge to others, etc., you will realize, only too late, that you have NOT accepted a teaching assignment so much as an invitation to a nightmare in which YOU have unwittingly quite by accident, entered.\r\n\r\nWhen you DO realize this, you will have one of two choices:\r\n\r\nTo either drop out of the course entirely and realize that as a result, you will then probably never be offered another SNHU course (which in hindsight is probably a good thing) OR to try and do your best.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason that academic adjunct work is often referred to as \"the adjunct ghetto\" because it is precisely that: YOU ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.\r\n\r\nI have read, with great interest, the other postings on here; some of them align with my own experience, others do not.  To the postings that talk about \"If you're teaching for the money then you shouldn't be in a class room\", etc I say with all due respect and politeness: THAT IS A JOKE THAT IS NOT FUNNY.\r\n\r\nAnyone who is an academic realizes that, unless they become an administrator, that they will not become wealthy, that is a given.  Most academics start out genuinely loving what they do and genuinely wanting to help and inspire others.\r\n\r\nThe \"tone\" of \"If you're doing it for the money\" is both insulting and disrespectful in several ways: as academics we have worked very hard (and in many cases, accumulated student debt) to do what we do, as instructors/professors we are deserving of a livable wage; notice I said \"livable\" and NOT \"be wealthy\" but \"livable\" as in: we can afford to pay our bills, have benefits (if full time) and perhaps even afford to take a vacation every now and then.\r\n\r\nNothing earth shattering; just a \"regular\" kind of life.\r\n\r\nHere is how SNHU treats it's adjuncts (for those who may be either potential adjuncts and/or students):\r\n\r\nFor an undergraduate course, instructors are paid $2200 for an 8 week session.\r\n\r\nWhile that may sound like a fair amount, once again here is the caveat: after you deduct for taxes AND when you realize that even though the team leads will tell you (if you ask) that you can expect to spend anywhere from 10-15 hours each week doing class related grading and posting, that is a FALLACY; in addition, as one of the other posters made mention of on here, this then equals out to about roughly $10 (if that, and that is probably a generous estimate) per hour.\r\n\r\nAgain, remember that the \"expectations\" for an SNHU adjunct online instructor are that for EACH of the 28 students you MUST provide AT LEAST a paragraph of feedback for EACH of the FOUR/FIVE assignments per WEEK: you can easily then  see how the mythology of \"10-15 hours per week\" is an outright fabrication and falsehood.\r\n\r\nThe worst part: after a while, as an instructor, you begin to feel simply overwhelmed with the sheer amount of grading and feedback you are expected to provide; the \"team leads\" micromanage out the wazoo and you are reprimanded as though you yourself are a student if you deviate from this AT ALL; again, it is both insulting, disrespectful, AND ultimately condescending.\r\n\r\nIn my current class, out of 28 students, I have a few who seem to be up to the challenge of university course work; most sadly, however, are not and these students and really all SNHU students are being sold a bill of goods: the belief that an SNHU degree will allow them to prosper in the \"real world\" - some students WILL in fact, prosper, most, however, will not, because as most of us who do have to live in the \"real world\" know, an individual is held accountable for their ability ultimately, to do, or not do, the job they were hired for.\r\n\r\nA sad fact: due to the onslaught of grading (and the arbitrary 'deadlines' for meeting the grading requirements) by the 4th week of my 8 week session, I began to just grade for the sake of grading; it was beyond exhausting and stressful, it was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nWhen I say \"grade for the sake of grading\" I mean just that: I would often give a cursory glance at the assignment and award the points: I feel guilty for doing this because it is not \"who\" I am normally, as an instructor; but with the massive amount of grading and feedback required, it was, I sadly discovered, the only way I could even hope to \"keep up\" with everything required of me.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what saddens me so much: it's a \"lose lose\" situation both for the students AND for the instructor.  The students deserve so much more than they are receiving; the instructor deserves so much more than they are receiving, too.\r\n\r\nNo one \"wins\" - everyone \"loses\" - yes, the students receive a grade, yes, the instructors receive money (a laughable amount at best); ultimately though, neither student nor instructor truly benefits in any real meaningful way.\r\n\r\nHaving taken the time to write all of this, I will say: if you are (as I once was) an adjunct struggling to make ends meet by often teaching several courses at often several different universities to cobble together a living wage (been there, done that) then SNHU can serve as a way to do that; but please know this in advance:\r\n\r\nYou will work an incredible amount for minimal compensation and you will be given students to \"work with\" who will either need unbelievable amounts of \"hand holding\" and endless questions that in some cases, can be quite demanding; ie., I had a student this session who constantly emailed with questions and if I did not respond immediately as in, within hours, would then email her academic advisor who would then email me, which of course then led to even MORE work for me.\r\n\r\nThis is not a self pitying review.  This is an honest review of my experience at SNHU as an online COCE adjunct faculty member.\r\n\r\nI have no problem with hard work.  I don't expect to become rich as an academic.\r\n\r\nWhat I DO have a problem with though, as I have discovered, is participating in something that leaves me feeling queasy and not very good about myself as a result; I understand the need for extra money and do not judge anyone for attempting to find ways in which to earn it; however please know this:\r\n\r\nIf you value your emotional/mental and physical well being, trying to earn extra money as an adjunct for SNHU will take the wind right out of your sails.\r\n\r\nThere are easier (and less stressful) ways to generate income: even selling items on Ebay would allow this without the hassle of team leads who come across as \"hallway monitor\" types (I realize the team leads are themselves also adjuncts and I honestly don't know WHY anyone would choose to take on that additional burden but if only for the extra money).\r\n\r\nSNHU like many online schools and for that matter, even traditional brick and mortar type universities are all about NUMBERS now; however, these schools go out of their way, through the use of slick advertising and marketing to present otherwise, please don't be fooled by it; it's about the NUMBERS."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Positive place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Academic Advisor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "All of the staff and my team has been very positive which is wonderful, super helpful and fast acting with questions", "cons": "The 2.5 late nights that are required.

Those types of reviews reek of incentives. \r\n\r\nSecond, over my time here, the culture has changed. We have moved from having a focus on knowing the students and helping them succeed to filling seats, no matter if they are ready for college or not. We are not a for-profit, we shouldn't act like one. If school is not in the student's best interest, if they are not ready, then pushing them to start as hard as the directors want is going to lead to a lot of term one drops. We have a reputation for accepting anyone, and I had spoken to several potential students who were put off by that. This goal of getting as many students into classes as possible is incredibly short sighted and will lead to a lot of negative views for the school in the long term.\r\n\r\nBefore I left, there was a survey tool that was sent out to employees to get feedback on how they felt things were going and gather any suggestions on what to fix. This was eventually shut down, and if memory serves the reason was \"security issues.\" Despite them telling us that it was no longer available, team leads still had access to it. This tells me that they heard our complaints, and instead of looking to fix the issues they decided enough was enough and it would be better to turn off the anonymous surveys to ignore us.\r\n\r\nSome team leads have no business in a leadership role. There is a difference between a boss and a manager. If your body starts violently shaking when an employee asks you for clarification and doesn't take \"because I said so\" as a respectable answer, you probably fall into the \"boss\" camp. We work at a university, I expect my supervisors to be able to give better explanations. And if you don't know the answer to something, just say that! Say that you don't know, then use the resources that are available to you as a supervisor to find some answers.\r\n\r\nI've known a few employees who disclosed that they had mental difficulties with their position and wanted to transfer to a different department, however they were denied due to not being there long enough. They were then promptly terminated. This brings in two issues: the lack of support for those who suffer mental difficulties made worse by these positions, and the inability to transfer to a different position that would be more suited towards a person's strengths. The employee handbook tells us that an employee would need to be with SNHU for 9 months before switching departments, however if you were hired through a temp agency this would change to 12 months. So far, I have yet to get an acceptable answer on why this policy exists. If one person worked at SNHU for, say, 8 months in the admission department, and wanted to switch to enrollment and support services, they would be denied over someone who comes in with no knowledge of how SNHU operates. Someone fresh off the street would have a better chance of getting a position than someone who already works there."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Evolving higher ed while traditional higher ed tries to keep its historical hierarchy", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Instructor in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The curriculum is evolving constantly to build a human instructors presence into competency-based models of learning.

Each assignment needs to have detailed feedback (that most students don't read, or read and ignore). I timed how long it took me to do that if I did my job right - aka read each assignment and then provide the feedback the student needed and also deserved. Grading alone took 30 hours. \r\n- You have to reply to every discussion board post no matter how pathetic of a post it is. 30 posts are the norm and you have to seriously think about what to say for about 20 of those totals you at least 5 hours. \r\n- Total time = 35 hours per week at 7 dollars an hour (using $250/week). That is no longer a part-time job. I'd like a salary and benefits now please. Oh, I can't have those?

Well, it is! SNHU is a for-profit diploma mill hiding behind the not-for-profit sanctimonious marketing SNHU puts out. \r\n- Not scaring you yet? How about submitting 8 cases for plagiarism and getting all 8 denied. All 8 cases had about 50-80% of the content totally copied and pasted from the internet, sometimes from Wikipedia. Reason given: well, the student cited their sources, they are just confused about paraphrasing. Are they now? Or are these MBA students just hip to the fact that they can get away with academic murder as long as it is APA conform?\r\n- Not triggering your deep sense of right and wrong yet? How about watching a student who has no business being in a high school, let alone the MBA program get their tuition credited towards retaking the class under another professor because you failed the student for submitting incomprehensible drivel. Checked her LinkedIn profile later that year and yep, she graduated with an MBA from SNHU. Hmmm.\r\n- The micromanaging Leads will then ring the death knell for your SNHU funeral.

You need to attend a bunch of seminars, write some pretty pointless essays about them and brand behaviors and sit on an interview panel composed of people that have nothing to do with your management chain.  All this to get promoted to Level II or III, where you do essentially the exact same job as at Level I.\r\n\r\n- There is nothing here to differentiate between good work and bad work.

Similarly, we have basically sales metrics, but no one is bonused or measured against them, so why do they exist for employees (I can see management using them to track progress).\r\n\r\n- Ultimately, low salary, no incentive pay, a convoluted and strictly timed promotion process can make this feel like a dead end job.  \r\n\r\n- Open enrollment is horrible.

(I'm guessing it's a bubble and we will see a lot of vacant buildings and unemployment when it pops.)  \r\n\r\nManagement is staffed by right-place-right-time promotions. Staff with no executive experience anywhere, literally former chain-restaurant waitresses, are making executive decisions on hundreds to thousands of staff. The woman who runs the whole online school is one of such promotions. She's impressed with her quick rise to executive level and loves to hear herself talk and all employees are required to attend webinars in which she repeatedly begins sentences with the phrase, \"I got where I am because...\" When asked her favorite book on management, she replied, \"Wicked.\" (Yes, the book version of a broadway show. But, like, they are in a school and like, they're friends, so obvious connection to snhu.)  When faced with making real management decisions, management grasps at straws and makes legally questionable decisions. They have a whole slew of exempt employees (the academic advisors) that they treat as exempt employees, tacitly condoning unpaid overtime. Yet they then make ludicrous night and weekend scheduling requirements (don't worry--they'll show you the charts to justify why that smart Middle-schooler could poke holes in). \r\n\r\nThey encourage a high turnover rate and are actually not invested in retention whatsoever. If you can't work nights they will ask you to quit. (Hint: you don't actually have to and if you need the paycheck you have every legal protection to keep going in in normal business hours.) They don't give yearly raises commensurate with inflation, period. The only way to earn more money is to be promoted. They pay borderline poverty wages--advisors come in at $28-38k ish.  The housing market in that area is growing at 7-10% per year and SNHU employees don't even get a 3-5% bump on their pay check. \r\n\r\nMy advice to current staff is don't make any major life decisions (purchasing a house, etc.) on SNHU alone because it's just unlikely to be sustainable between the lack of retention and the strong likelihood that it's a bubble.\r\n\r\nThe \"education\" they purport to provide. Ohhhh boy. The concepts are elementary at best. The texts are literal picture books, rife with spelling and grammatical errors.  And the best part, all of those former chain restaurant waitresses and uneducated management with no experience pursue SNHU online courses to earn a degree. \r\n\r\nFinal issue--encouraging these students to borrow $20-30k and facilitating the path to do so is downright predatory.

If you have a good idea, someone else will claim it is theirs. If you bring this up, you are told you are the problem.\r\n\r\nContinually changing initiatives and direction to the point that nothing is ever getting completed. It's like going in circles with nothing ever coming to completion. Look before you leap.. they have never heard of that before. Think about consequences, the big picture. Horrible project management.  If you bring this up, you will be told you cannot deal with change.\r\n\r\nYou are often left out of meetings and communications needed to do your job. It is very much like high school with the \"in\" clique continuously Skyping and gossiping all day long. If you are not \"in\" you are at a serious disadvantage when it comes to communication.\r\n\r\nYou are not promoted on accomplishments, skill, attention to detail or loyalty.  A select group are continuously promoted to newly created bogus supervisory positions  in order to be given salary increases and leveled up, while those who do the actual work and have been dedicated employees are left in their original positions with minimal compensation increases and are often the ones who get stuck with the less than  \"plum\" projects. If you bring this up, you will be told you are not qualified for a promotion.\r\n\r\nWith sudden and often changes in direction, many employees' work is taken away and given to others, with no communication as to what the reason is. Sometimes there is even a duplication of efforts. The work is dwindled and dwindled away until the employee either quits, tries to find their own work, or complains. It is like being cast off of an island with no direction. When you try to find your own direction, you are told you are disruptive, inadequate, or a trouble maker and you are often put on an improvement plan. It really makes me question the efficiency of the organization. Maybe the department I was in was over staffed. The more people this happened to, the more I realized that this is a calculated way of getting employees to resign, and because they are well performing, they have no reason to fire them. They FORCE you out.\r\n\r\nIf you bring this up, you are told  \"this is not the place for you....\"\r\n\r\nPutting all of this together, I should have realized that a lot of it amounted to bullying and a grievance should have been filed.  It was an experience for me, but not a growth experience. It is sad because it could have been a good position, but it did not make use of my skills. \r\n\r\nMake no mistake, if they don't want you there, they will force you out by withholding work, exclusion, lack of communication, and personal attacks."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Adjunct Professor", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fort Lauderdale, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent University to work for and to attend.

Their entire mission is to rake in money while they provide a completely watered down curriculum.  Of course, students are praised and told how great they are doing in classes.  Students almost all get A's as the grading rubrics are skewed that way. So, in the long run, students \"succeed\" at SNHU by passing the 5th grade curriculum, but when they enter the workforce, they fail because they have neither the knowledge nor the skills to compete with others from competing universities.  SNHU doesn't care about this nor about their students once they graduate and are out the door.  Not their problem anymore!   They already have their money and can fund their TV commercials and ridiculously overpaid administrators who do nothing but sit back and give orders to their \"underlings\". Many are former Western Governors University employees who left there (or were fired) and found a home at COCE.\r\n\r\nThe full-time faculty are mandated by the administration who control everything.  Full-time faculty in COCE don't even have an opportunity to change the online BlackBoard sites to add their own content.  Even the syllabus is off limits to all faculty. They can't select textbooks for courses and can't add in lectures to the online courses. The administration hires \"subject matter experts\"  (and I use that term very loosely since they also hire anyone with a pulse to fill these positions) who work for cheap stipends and SNHU gets what they pay for.  Faculty are treated like \"pawns\" and are kept out of all important discussions and decisions, which are made exclusively by administrators who think only of making money. If you want to be treated poorly and not respected for being a scholar, then SNHU COCE is for you.\r\n\r\nIf you think SNHU is different and is a success where other online institutions fail, forget it.  They only portray that their students succeed where other institutions have failed them.  That part IS true. Their students failed at other universities because they SHOULD have failed.  Students are incredibly low quality at SNHU COCE and really shouldn't be in an institution of higher learning. The world needs people with trade skills and there are those that should not have college degrees.  SNHU has found a way to capitalize on these folks, take their hard earned money, tell them they are doing great and then send them into the world with a subpar education.  SNHU COCE teaches students very little and sets them up for future workforce failure. It is essentially \"academic fraud\". \r\n\r\nI was lied to in my interview and told that there were opportunities to advance my career.  Hah!  I was later told that things change and we are \"now going in a different direction\".  I would say that is true: SNHU is going downward into a spiral!\r\n\r\nBy the way, this is more than just \"sour grapes\".
