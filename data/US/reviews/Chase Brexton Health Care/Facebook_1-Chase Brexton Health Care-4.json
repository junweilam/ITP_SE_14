All that is left is a toxic climate of self-preservation.  And the problems are much deeper than the most recent complaints.\u2026 like the planned pay cut to medical providers, the mismanagement of the behavioral health team, or the burnout of administrative staff. \r\n\r\nEveryone knows that healthcare is undergoing changes and that they are a challenge to navigate.  No organization handles it perfect.  But some organizations find a way to make it in this new marketplace - thanks to strong leadership, effective communication, and a clear plan that staff can rally around.  \r\n\r\nChase Brexton is not one of these organizations. Instead of stepping up and taking ownership of their role in this floundering change management initiative, our current senior leadership resorts to finger pointing, name calling, and misrepresentation of facts.  It may be nice and convenient to blame the recent turnover on long-term staff\u2026. saying they are bitter or out of touch with modern health care.... but there is a lot of turnover of new hires too!  They see the writing on the wall and are even less committed to working at Chase Brexton than old staff.\r\n\r\nSeveral other reviews talk about the pharmacy and behavioral health but this is how senior leadership treats employees across the board.  A string of poorly executed changes began several years ago with a firing and then the re-hiring of both case management and IT staff (IT was outsourced until that failed).  Then there were multiple rounds of medical provider turnover.  The issues grew worse as we lost almost the entire senior leadership team several times over.\u2026 and many of them were new hires or new promotions themselves, including multiple CMOs and COOs.  We are now losing many key support staff who are sick of being told to do more with less.  And all the while, they are left to deal with the growing amounts of exasperated patients and providers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, new initiatives are launched with tons of fanfare and then closed and then relaunched without any explanation.  Systems and processes change from week to week.  People get moved around left and right.  Belts get tighter. Yet senior leadership sings their own praises and ignores the implosion happening in front of them.  It is no wonder that everyone feels insecure in their jobs, believes that the changes are poorly planned, and then write reviews like the ones here.  With another round of providers about to leave, let us hope that leadership will see that their strategy of throwing staff under the bus is not working."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Disappointing!!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Oct 2016", "job_title": " in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Had fabulous supervision at CBHS", "cons": "Once the new CEO came in the whole center started sinking!\r\nI was an employee hired in 2006.
