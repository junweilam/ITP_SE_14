Honestly, I have worked here for quite some time, and I have seen too many people come and go to even count. We have extremely high turn over as of late, people are dissatisfied, including myself, and when the opportunity arises, I will be gone to. Some factors that contribute to the overall unhappiness are : \r\n* We are constantly understaffed (people call in \"sick\" ,but I think people are just worn out)\r\n*Our managers/supervisors/team leads all have egos and they all want power,most of them do not really know what they are doing\r\n*They always tell us they welcome our suggestions,but when you give them suggestions and speak up ,they view you as a trouble maker\r\n*The only way you can \"get ahead\" is by being someone's pet, the nepotism at this place is unreal!\r\n*Our technology does not work(handhelds), it is quite antiquated\r\n*Dealing with some nurses can be sheer terror , most of them have bad attitudes, some of them are bigots, and most of them are lacking in the common sense department\r\n*Management could care less about employees who have been there for years, yet they cater to the newer employees, or the employees who could give a crap\r\n*Pay is not competitive, new employees start off making as much as someone who has been there for years\r\n*High management/supervisor/team lead turnover\r\n* Seniority does not exist"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Would recommend", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Saint Louis Park, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance, focused on making a difference for thier patients", "cons": "The pay and benefits are disapointing"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Medical Receptionist in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really good health and retirement benefits", "cons": "Limited ability to get promoted"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Music Therapist in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Person centered for both patients and employees\r\nGood educational opportunities \r\nSupportive leadership", "cons": "Since the company is so big it\u2019s possible to feel disconnected from the decision making process"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Long time employee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Jan 2021", "job_title": "MRI Technologist in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I would work here forever if I weren\u2019t looking for better weather;
