You can exchange shifts whenever, and if you don't feel like working, you can put your shift up (someone needs to take it though).

Hours suck (10:30p-7:30a) but you get used to it and are usually home by 7:30 because they cut you loose at 7. Pretty much all of the job is just sitting at the desk, with the exception being the occasional emergency, so it is a good job to knock out a bunch of homework, projects, or even get some studying done. I've also gotten a 35 cent pay raise since I started just by being around for so long.", "cons": "Like I said, the hours. 9 hour overnight shifts can be a bit rough, and it shows in the high turnover.

It is also a job that, for the most part, you will be alone. If that's you, cool, but sometimes it does get a bit lonely and a lot of the staff can be a bit socially awkward anyways.
