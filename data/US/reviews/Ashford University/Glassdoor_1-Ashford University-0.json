Also, you get every Federal Holiday as a paid day off.\r\n\r\n* Perks - The company offers some discounts at local events (i.e. Padres games) and hosts special events for employees (i.e. Wild Animal Park company picnic)\r\n\r\n* Work Environment - the Sunroad and Evening Creek buildings are fairly new, provide roomy cubices, and have good snack and lunch options in the cafes (Evening Creek is much better than Sunroad, however)\r\n\r\n* Diversity - fellow employees range in age, with the majority being 20-30 yrs old, but there are some older employees as well", "cons": "*Young Management - fellow employees range in age, with the majority being 22-30 yrs old. However if you are over 26 yrs of age, expect your manager and their supervisor to be younger than you. This can be extremely frustrating, as there is a lack of management experience company-wide, and many managers were promoted before they were ready. As a new employee, if you are assigned to one of the aforementioned managers, your success will be nearly impossible unless you are willing to do an obscene amount of brown-nosing and network with the right people to learn the ins and outs on your own.\r\n\r\n*Telemarketing - In the interviews and training they say you will get \"warm leads\", but the truth is the numbers you call to find prospective students were bought by the company and are very cold leads.  Nine times out of ten, they were job hunting online and accidentally entered their info, but they are not interested in going to school. The Admissions Counselor job is a sales job, and you will need to leave your conscience and morals at the door in order to succeed. If the person you are talking to is unemployed and has no way to pay off the loans, you are expected to ignore that and talk them into going to school, whether or not it is really the best thing for them. The ones who succeed in this position aren't the brightest employees there, they are the sharks or the ones who are too dim to realize that what they are doing is wrong.\r\n\r\n*Repetitive and Dull - Being a telemarketing position, you will spend 90% of your day dialing numbers and listening to ringtones. If you actually get someone on the phone, they will usually hang up on you once they hear where you are calling from. The managers keep track of the call logs, so they will know how much you are dialing and what your talk time is, so there is pressure to dial 300-400 numbers a day if you aren't talking to enough people.\r\n\r\n*Advancement is Unlikely - Yes, there is room for advancement in the company, but you are not likely to be one of the chosen few. Timing is everything, so if you happen to have the experience and the numbers at the right time, you might get promoted, but it will take years and a lot of shameless brown-nosing. You need to be your manager's favorite to get noticed, which means you need to have the most students out of your whole team, and keep it that way every week. And you need to find your inner cheerleader and spout Ashford University propaganda every chance you get so you fit in with the higher-ups. Easy enough if you have no pride or mind of your own.\r\n\r\n*Parking and Elevator Congestion - You do not have any promise of a parking spot. Expect to arrive at least 30 min early in order to maybe get a parking spot. Otherwise, expect to park blocks away from the building. And if you want to go out to lunch, realize you risk not finding a parking spot when you return and most likely being late. Also, factor in extra time for the elevator line. In the morning and after lunch, you will need at least 10-15 minutes to wait in line for the elevator. And if you want to go downstairs to grab a snack on your break, you will spend 10 of your 15 minutes dealing with the elevator situation . Oh, and at the end of the day, you will spend up to 20 minutes trying to get on the elevator to leave, and another 15 minutes stuck in traffic out of the parking lot. When you add up the time spent each day on these issues, it gets extremely frustrating.\r\n\r\n*Numbers are Everything - And finally, if all of the above hasn't gotten to you and you have a great attitude, they will still fire you if you haven't enrolled enough students. They are constantly analyzing your numbers, and no matter how great you are, that is all they care about at the end of the day. If you are a superb salesperson, you can be successful here. For the rest of you, beware. This is not a counseling job, you are not saving the world, it is sales, sales, sales. Leave your morals at the door, and you just might like it here."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good pay and benefits, hard to stick around.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Your experience really depends on your manager.

Employees are directed to focus on sales and boosting the university's numbers (read: quantity, not quality); Advisors work in very loud work environments (teams on each floor are encouraged to ring bells, cheer, chant, and play music at all levels to compete with surrounding teams); Employees are directed to call the same phone numbers up to three times per day (this is a cold-call center, although employers will try to have you believe these are \"warm\" calls); Neither Ashford nor Bridgepoint Education, Ashford's parent company, is interested in the quality of the students' education, as depicted by the high student drop-out rate and high employee turnover; Ashford exploits students who rely on federal student aid (general loans, veteran grants, and loans for disability), especially those who are easily tricked and have backgrounds with little schooling; Advisors will push potential students to apply in the first phone call; Advisors will use any trick to keep individuals on the phone, including lying and fabricating stories that may resonate with the individuals; Managers and directors assess each advisor\u2019s hours by recording and calculating how the advisor delegates every minute during the working day (time spent on the phone, number of phones calls per day, and hours \u201caway\u201d, including time spent in the bathroom).\r\n\r\nYou can get by in an Enrollment Services Advisor position at Ashford University for a few months by doing nearly nothing (or by making positive changes to alert callers/customers/students of Ashford\u2019s fa\u00e7ade and of the individual\u2019s rights as a customer), but it will catch up to you. I took the job at Ashford because I was desperate, they paid a decent amount for a starting salary, and the position was seemingly in an area in which I had interest and experience. I wasn\u2019t naive to the fact that this was a call center where morals might be questionable, I was just desperate for a job and I had some sliver of hope that I might make a positive difference.\r\n\r\nI did the best that I could to inform individuals of their right to ask us to stop calling (which, by law, requires the caller to stop if there is no business and/or monetary agreement between the two). Without Ashford\u2019s encouragement or approval, I created my own English and computer lessons for a student who should not have been admitted into the school to begin with, who should have, instead, taken remedial classes to understand the basic concepts of certain subjects.

Asking this question ultimately got me no more classes. The \"coaching\" consisted of being told to cut and paste reponses with ther person's name in every one, irrespective of when it made sense to offer feedback. It was also pressure to perform much more labor for the same paycheck with zero insight from the instructor. You can bet the feedback I got from the \"coach\" was the same type they were advocating: cut and pasted suggestions for improvement. Even before the pressure to do more unpaid academic labor, the pay is about what you'd make at McDonalds. No dialog allowed on what constitutes good teaching, and actually no good teaching required. Just give everyone perfect scores or the professor is required to explain every point deducted from the student, they do not have to earn points. you earn the right to deduct points. the majority of students did need assistance and were not writing at a college level. in every course, there was at least one person found to be plagiarizing to the level of needing to be reported. this can be challenging because to truly offer a worthwhile educational experience, addressing these issues is time consuming. students rated my courses highly and made comments indicating the instruction was good. the coach rated me as \"distinguished\" in all but one category where they said I was under for not cutting and pasting enough pat responses and 100% repeating the students name in every commment so as soon as the course was over, I was told there weren't any classes available. within a month, they'd deleted my account entirely.

They emphasize in their interview process and I acknowleded I  understood this would be the case. I also was told to expect to be hung up on and cursed at while on the job. Got it-and I did not take that part personally while on the job. However, In this position, I was making hundreds of calls daily to students who made it more than abundantly clear they were not interested in attending college.  It's ironic because in the training manual we receive it states that we are not to call students excessively.  They never give a number to the word 'excessively\", but I can tell you in my case I was expected to call new leads  3 to 4 sometimes even 5 times a day!  Does that seem excessive?  I doubt if collection agencies phone their clients that often.\r\nThis is a numbers driven game; while I was there, I actually produced a decent number of enrollments and had never been talked to or disciplined for a lack of productivity. As far as the numbers driven part, they will tell you the opposite, that AU is about the student and changing their lives for the better.  Selling them the idea that their lives will be so much better in four years when they attain their Bachelors degree.  I honestly beleived that I would be in the business of helping people.  Not so much.  Enrollments and how many you can attain in the week is the name of the game.  One day when my manager was particularly frustrated at us actually told us 'you can pretend its not a numbers driven game all you want, but it is!'  I was instructed that in the course of talking to a prospective student, if they in any way indicated they may have a prior default on a loan to end the call as soon as posssible-\"dont' waste your time on them.\"  I was made to call individuals who had previously, explicitely stated 'take me off of your call list'.  Talking indigent students--people who could barely put food on the table, people who could not even afford their own computer--into a $50,000 online education is, in my opinion unethical and unconscionable.  \r\nIn addition, my experience with management was dismal.  Poor, inadequete coaching and teaching methods was what I endured throughout my tenure there.\r\nI really could go on with specific stories of unethical, hostile, intimidating stories of what I and others experienced there, but it would take up too much space here.  I'll end with this--I really did make a decent wage there and had excellent benefits--those things could not even come close to making up for the sick sinking feeling I had everyday while on their 'sales' floor.

At the time I was in the middle of one class and had another assigned, so even though the eval was ridiculous and the changes that were demanded of me were way out of line (especially, as I said, considering the lousy pay) I made the changes in the middle of the class I was teaching, and incorporated them into the next class when it started.  I don't even want to calculate what my hourly rate was given the pay and the demands on my time.  When the second class ended, I had no further offerings.  I figured enrollment numbers were down and a class would come, given that I had rarely gone more than a week or two between starts.  Two months later, there was still no offering, so I emailed the individual in charge of making course assignments, as well as the office that oversaw them to see if maybe I had missed some mandatory training.  No answer whatsoever.  Another month later and I receive an email in my personal email saying they no longer required my services.  No explanation, no consideration that I altered what I was doing to meet all of the demands from my evaluation (despite my better judgment), no opportunity for improvement.

You are expected not only to enroll your student but basically strong arm them to complete their first class.. walking them almost hand in hand in how to get their homework done.  I swear my young daughter who is 3rd grade needs less coaxing to go to school.  Every week they go over a report of how your students are progressing by going over what assignments they have or have not completed along with their current grade etc.  This is all because the student pool that Ashford gets via leads they buy or referrals are not even remotely interested in school.  Managers say the student enrolls because of you(advisor) not the school. With that comment you basically downplayed the value of your school and based it instead on the likeability of the advisor .\r\n\r\n4. Middle management is full of themselves.  They throw around the fact that they rec'd a masters degree , yet the job they are in doesn't even require a degree.  You have a masters degree and you are training coach.

Although not stated , Ashford actively recruits African American students, which is great , however they also have the lowest graduation rates.  You as an advisor are basically expected to convince the student that they should go to college .. take out loans knowing full well that only 20% will ever finish.\r\n\r\n6.

Maybe 1 in 10 calls you will reach a live person who says \"STOP calling Me, your company calls me about 5 times a day, every day\". The reason being is they hand out call lists and literally all the advisers call the same contacts several times a day until they reach a live person. The only way you get incoming calls is if you achieve high student enrollment, catch, the only way you can do this is by having a good lead list which does not exist. Basically advisers learned the tricks, you just dial 250-300 numbers a day off these sheets to get it to appear you have tried really hard to find students, this will save you your job for a week or two. They monitor EVERY call, your every move and it couldn't be more micro managed of an environment, very far from the truth the recruiters will tell you. They also will give you the crappy hours that nobody wants until you are there for a year or so. You can't make your own hours as the recruiters said.

Why did this call only last 10 seconds?

As an instructor for Ashford's undergraduate education program, I was horrified by the inability of these would-be/future teachers to put together coherent, grammatically correct sentences.  This started to make sense as the media began to pick up stories about Ashford's less than ethical diploma mill practices.  \r\n\r\nAbout 2012, the focus of the program shifted so instructors were given \"suggested\" responses to provide students when giving feedback or following up on online posts.  If the scripted responses were not used and, heaven forbid, you responded authentically and individually, the instructional specialist overseeing your class would give a negative evaluation for the class.  From 2008 to 2012, I had near perfect reviews from the students and corporate.  When the canned responses became the expectation, the students weren't happy and unhappy students mean that corporate isn't happy either.  I was asked to teach a class in early 2013.  It was clear that the curriculum wasn't fully developed.  I felt it was a disservice to the students, both academically and financially.  I also received complaints from students in my class about the lack of coherence in the program which I passed along to the corporate office in San Diego.  When I was \"encouraged\" to use the canned responses and basically stick to the script, I informed the faculty member who had written the class that I would continue to respond in a manner that would help my students and further more, I would not be issuing any failing grades for that section since I didn't feel the students should be penalized for Ashford's lack of planning.
