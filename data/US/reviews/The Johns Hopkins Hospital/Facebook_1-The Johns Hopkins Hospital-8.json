To my brown people: avoid if possible, but you can definitely do it, just lay low with management (no matter how down-to-earth they come off).\n\nThe culture if for those who enjoy power positions and nurses who do not want to actually be bedside. Many staff nurses hate their home lives and use JHH as a way to control something in their life. My best advice: (1) recognize the individuals that are unhappy at home and minimize contact with them, (2) don't stay at JHH too long"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good place to gain experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Certified Pharmacy Technician in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cross training in different areas", "cons": "Low salary poor management stressful environment.

Zero attempts at employee retention, in fact I think they prefer a revolving door for nursing staff. Preference to filling critical holes with travelers rather than hiring new staff or even better, offering any incentives for employee retention. Even unit managers have been forced to manage multiple units at once permanently rather than replacing staff. So many nurses, especially in ICUs, use the opportunity to gain minimal experience to allow them to pursue advanced degrees. Pay increases are ambiguous and dismal. Benefits were cut back every year, with no more 401k matching and pensions complete eliminated. Staff is not supported as being valuable, rather, the mentality that you are working for \"the big name\" is prevalent. A few years ago, they fought tooth and nail to prevent the institution of a nursing union--they harassed nursing staff, intentionally created divides amongst staff and spent big bucks on big PR & legal firms to come in and propagandize. Clear that there are big cliques in many of the nursing departments and often will have difficulty working with some department leaders as they are always out of town at various conventions. Advancement can be difficult, with huge requirements for \"extra\" work without compensation.

NP's have to earn CE credits in order to be able to renew their certifications and licenses, but many JHH NP's now have to do so on their own dime.  This was for all intents and purposes a pay cut, and we were already getting paid well below market rate to begin with.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the physicians still receive annual bonuses as large as the annual pay for some lower level employees.  The administration's priorities are very clear.   \r\n\r\nJHH and JHU are two separate institutions; JHU generally offers much better benefits.   Some NP's work for JHH, and others work for JHU.  It's complicated and not good for staff morale to have two different classes of employees working side by side.  For example, JHU employees get paid maternity leave, while JHH employees just get FMLA.\r\n\r\nJHH also used to automatically pay a good chunk of the tuition for nurses who enroll at the JHUSON, but they no longer pay for certificate programs earned there, only full degrees.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of big egos throughout the hospital, and this can get in the way of good, safe patient care.

I see, in my department, a high level of incompetence which the management refuses to acknowledge and/or do anything about. This hospital as a whole has an enormous turn around rate which means new employees constantly and starting over constantly. Instead of treating their current, seasoned employees better, they seem to prefer hiring people who cannot keep up with the volume. From my experience here, even if you voice your concerns, they don't seem to want to hear you and are afraid to get rid of dead weight. With so much negative retention, the stress of the workload falls on your good workers who tend to burn out at an incredible rate. They pay is mediocre at best and is not worth the insane workload which leads to people deciding to slack off because they don't get paid enough to do all of that work. This, unfortunately, filters down to the patient level. Care is compromised when your skilled workforce is fed up. The benefits were very good, but now they are starting this new requirement. If you want 100% coverage, you have to use a hopkins affiliated physician. If you choose not to, you are responsible for 10% of the medical bill. Problem with this is 1.) If you have a long term primary care physician that you are comfortable with and they are not a hopkins physician, you are going to pay for it. 2.) All of your labs and results are run through the main hospital and accessible to fellow employees, there have been instances of the entire department finding out about a pregnancy or other medical conditions before the employee was comfortable telling anyone. 3.) The Hopkins physicians are not everywhere, so if you happen to live out in the country, the mountains or even into a boardering state, you may not have a hopkins physician anywhere nearby to go to. So now, the pay is getting cut all around the hospital (except for the executives and upper management), they have taken control over your choices in benefits and the area the main campus is in is dangerous and unsafe.
