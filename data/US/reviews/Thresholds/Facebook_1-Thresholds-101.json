We even sent a video out to the coworkers about the Union, but today's young professionals have a bad sense of History. They don't care to understand how the unions have helped form workers' rights. When our attempts to organize failed, management went after those who were in the video, firing them for the flimsiest of reasons. I once worked under a director who had written me up simply for not responding to an email right away because I was so busy. The accusation? Insubordination. Insubordination! I tried appealing to human resources employment relations, but that's a waste of time. They don't really listen to the community support specialists, but they always side with management no matter what. Even a manager of employment relations,  who is very nasty and crude. As a Black woman, you would think that she would understand those who had to start at the bottom and who have been mistreated, but she obviously forgot where she came from. In the housing aspect of Thresholds, you have certain clients who have posed a threat to co-workers and the clients have been allowed to stay even after many warnings and many violations. A desk clerk was once beaten up by a drug pusher that a client brought into the building after being told many times not to. Just recently, a male coworker was sexually assaulted by a male client. Instead of going to the police, which was his right, he only reported it to management, confident that they would do something about it. At first, they started planning to evict this client, but they changed their minds. The reason? Because the client apologized! Is that a load of bull or what! I tried talking to employee relations  about it as well as my director, and my director's supervisor, but they still did nothing about it, and employee relations turned my complaint over to the my director's supervisor and told me that she didn't want to hear it because it was not an employee relations matter! I can't even transfer from one site to the other. I would try to apply to a location closer to home, go through the interview and everything, but even though I had been with the agency for years and had gotten good annual reviews, they still won't hire me. At one place on the southside, the director I interviewed with told lies about me to justify not hiring me. As a Black man, you would think he would know a thing or two about discrimination. On top of this, my supervisors broke an agreement whenever I was split between sites whenever there was a staff shortage, and everyone, including the team leader, told me to just deal with it. Well, first, I like to be kissed before I get screwed, and second, don't spit in my face and tell me it's raining. Every year when we are given the survey for Chicago's best and brightest top 101 workplaces, I always give a very candid review of the agency, and every year Thresholds wins. What did the higher-ups have to do to get this every year when they only deserve it because of benefits, morale notwithstanding? With the troubled clients that I enjoyed working with, the third parties, and all others involved, the worst part of the job was dealing with callous and power-hungry management. Yes, this agency and their leadership have broken my heart thoroughly, and they killed my morale. The new leaders would make so many decisions and micromanage me as if I just graduated yesterday, barely taking time to ask for my input as a veteran. They are very reckless with the hearts of their workers and their ability to do their jobs with the clientele. This year, we were offered $1,000 to refer our friends to Thresholds for employment, but I would not refer my enemies to this place. If you see an advertisement for an opening at Thresholds, press delete. If someone comes to you trying to get you to apply, run!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "1 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Team Lead in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a passion-driven field.", "cons": "Pay is not competitive although it I'd improving."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Team leader", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Team Leader in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexibility, work-life balance, good people, growth", "cons": "The pay is too low for Masters level"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It was alright", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Home Health Aide in Grand Rapids, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible, it was a pretty chill job", "cons": "Underpaid and the workers were lazy"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Exploitative work environment.

The leadership at this organization is very unprofessional. They gossip about employees and form cliques.  Morale is extremely low among employees.  The pay is horribly low, not enough to raise/feed a family.  However, employees are required to have a bachelors or masters degree to become employed. Factories and warehouse workers get paid more money without a degree.  Thresholds has a recurrence of bedbug infestation in their residential homes and facilities. However, employees are forced to transport these individuals in their personal vehicles.  Thresholds has had to send pest control to employee homes for treatments.  Let's not discuss the high miles, wear and tear on your vehicle. The best part about the job is being able to advocate and build relationships with some of the members.  However, many of the members you service live in high crime neighborhoods. You are required to bill medicaid for services that may not have been rendered or get written up for productivity.  Employees are told to be creative (unethical !!!) to reach productivity goals set by the agency. My job entailed finding jobs for members who have mental illnesses and drug addictions. Unfortunately, you are held accountable for members not becoming employed when they realistically have multiple barriers.  How do you find a job for individuals who are non adherence to medical treatment, have drug addictions, mental illnesses and do not want to engage???  However, when you job develop (seeking out employers), you lie and tell them you have the best person for the job just to reach your goals. Once a member is hired, you have to practice job retention (helping the member keep the job).  The job, you knew the member would not keep due to their many barriers. The goals are very unrealistic.
