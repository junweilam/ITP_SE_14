Additionally, you can only use their transition related healthcare bonus if you also have their health insurance. They rolled out tons of benefits in the last six months but most people can't use any of them. At the KC office, there are two managers over social services with WILDLY different approaches. Both have insane turnover rates, but one is worse. She can't leave you alone for a whole hour without feeling compelled to micromanage you. I had not even finished my 90-day training period when I was asked to begin taking on additional duties, for no change in pay. The turnover rate in staff leaves remaining staff routinely covering clients that aren't on their caseload. Clients slip through the gaps as a result. Case loads are way too high, especially when leadership is constantly adding responsibilities and demanding more \"quality\" interactions. There are a lot of other, somewhat petty complaints I have, but this one isn't petty. Accountability.
