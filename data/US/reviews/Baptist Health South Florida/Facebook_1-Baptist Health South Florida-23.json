Not the place to work for sure, it used to be but for some reason they are trying to make people fill out the survey they pass every year \"Gallup\" to say good things about the company but when the Gallup survey shows low scores they meet with employees to try to force good answers in the survey. Now they even opted to change survey company to try and shift the clearly noticeable decline in employee satisfaction.\r\n2. The recently this year they did away with all the remote days for all IT employees and also did away with the bonus structure and merit increases went from being anywhere from 1 to 6 percent to now just being 1% if you exceed. \r\n3. Most position are held by the same person for years even in Mgmt even if they don't have the right skill set and treat employees like garbage, also if the Mgmt likes you then you will go places if you hang out with them at happy hour and cater to them. If not you are pretty much in the dog house and can spend years in the same position with minimum salary increat or anything at all. Also promotions are not based on knowledge but rather favoritism and friendships with upper mgmt.\r\n4. They don't like it when people resign the company as if you don't have the right to leave but you have to be careful to make sure that when you leave they don't tag you with HR as DO NO REHIRE or else you can never apply for a job there again. Normally, if someone in mgmt does not like they will tag your HR file just to do the damage even if you didn't do anything wrong. Mgmt does not like any suggestions for improvement specially the CIO wow that lady is lost.\r\n5. When there are team meeting they mgmt always tells you that you are furtunate to have a job and they keep reminding you that everytime as they are doing you a favor for working at BHSF after all you are working and putting in the hours so nobody is doing you a favor. I am sure if you stop or don't deliver your work they will fire so no favor is being done for anyone.\r\n6. All specifically the IT Mgmt are a bunch of people who hang out for happy hour after work and that's how they climb the corporate steps, they cover each other for big mistakes and moeny that is being spent with no reason. The IT mgmt makes so many mistakes when it comes to IT Budgets that I believe if the CEO of the company some days realizes that momey is just being spend senseless someone's head is going to role but since there is a disconnect nobody care and the money goes down the drain, hundreds of thosands of dollars I saw it first hand.\r\n7. As far a talent go, they pride in retaining talent but they don't most talented people leave there a particular AVP in IT that is pretty much lost and she will not take any suggestions from anyone period, this person sticks to old school technology and promises the world but half the time she cannot deliver, the business units know this but the brush it off. BHSF mostly relies on vendors to do the work since there is not talent there to the point that they are still running Window XP at the desktop level when other companies are already running windows 7 or 8 and they pride themselves at being at the cutting edge of technolgy. Even when new hires comes at least for IT they find out soon enought that what was promise is not what it is what they are going to be doing after a year they realize they are losing their skills sets and they decide to leave.\r\n\r\nI can go on and on and on but that's BHSF in a nutshell."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "STOP FAVORITISM", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Jun 2015", "job_title": "RN in Miami, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tuition reimbursement, discounts, 403b, ect", "cons": "opportunity to learn and grow is based \"depending on who you know\" based on \"FAVORITISM\" or if you belong to a specific group of people from a specific country or group.
