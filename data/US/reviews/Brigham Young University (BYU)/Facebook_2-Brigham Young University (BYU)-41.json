The only formal means we have to communicate with the administration are: 1) pass it up through the department chair; 2) submit questions by email that they may or may not choose to address, and if they do it is to \"instruct\" the faculty member; and, most recently, post on Facebook, which may be removed if it reflects negatively on the university.  This has led to a highly cynical faculty that feels completely detached from the decision-making process at the university.\r\n\r\nThe other primary concern has to do with work load.  Twelve hours of teaching per semester for three semesters a year.  No load release is given for committee or other assignments.
