Because my employers were familiar with my schedule and the academic calendar, maintaining a work/school/life balance was easier than if I'd worked off-campus, and the hourly wage was much higher than the minimum wage I'd be earning anywhere else. \r\n\r\nBecause I was assisting in an academic area I hoped to pursue in my graduate education, getting to know my professors better by working for them allowed for stronger letters of recommendation. I was also able to have more frequent out-of-classroom conversations with them about my research.\r\n\r\nI learned great things about writing from correcting hundreds (and hundreds, and hundreds) of other students' essays. And because the classes I assisted were related to classes I'd taken in the past--but not necessarily identical--I was able to learn new things without the burden of paying extra tuition or doing unpaid homework. Plus, if you schedule the maximum number of office hours, chances are pretty good that *most* of the time students won't be coming to visit you (except leading up to a test or major assignment).

You totally want to help, but there's not a lot you can do at that point. And don't make the mistake of allowing students to email you their drafts for feedback right up until the day before deadline--I must have given feedback on a good hundred essays in a single day trying to fulfil the committment I'd made.\r\nAdditionally, student athletes can be remarkably entitled (not all, but some--I've never had a non-student athlete assume none of the rules apply to them). In one of my larger classes I had several swim team and baseball team members. The swim students came in regularly and early for help with their essays and test study groups. When they knew they'd be away from campus for an exam or assignment, they were careful to complete it early. The baseball team members regularly missed exams without notice, turned in papers late, and then expected us to accommodate them by changing the syllabus rules since they were student athletes. (?
