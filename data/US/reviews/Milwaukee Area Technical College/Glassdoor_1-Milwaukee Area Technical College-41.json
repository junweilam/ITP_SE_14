Management is very passive but yet they complain about the same employees. MATC administrators do not care how much money students pay to get into college or the admissions process. Administrators like to portray that MATC cares about the community but they only care about how much money they make (always six figures plus other benefits). Administrators are aware of staff and other highly paid administrators who steal time (say they are at work when they are actually completing papers to earn their Ph.D. or Masters, or using MATC hours to work at their other jobs). MATC wastes a lot of time with archaic procedures. Most Administrators and management use good employees to make processes better and take credit. Broken procedures are not update but rather worked around affecting students negatively.

Very strong shared sense of the education mission, this is a great place to work for education professionals who want to make a difference and make a decent living at the same time.  I was a wandering adjunct in the Chicago area for years, so I can make a very valid comparison, this is by far the best higher education place of work I've found in the tri-state area.  The cons are unusual and unique, but keep in perspective, overall, this two year college is the best place to work for an academic who wants to teach (it's not a place for those oriented towards research, it's a two year technical college).", "cons": "Aging faculty can be a problem at times.  Although in general, those with more teaching time have more experience, and thus, are usually more effective teachers and helpful colleagues, this faculty is very lopsided on the side of those on the verge of retirement (too many should have retired years ago).  They can be a powerful passive force resisting progress.  For example, we have this antiquated method of choosing textbooks (the whole department votes, or a committee decides the textbook for all sections of each course) dating back long before the Internet, and possibly before color televisions.  The over 60 voting block NEVER votes to change the existing textbook (too much work to change the syllabus perfected back when Nixon was President), so it takes a very unlikely set of circumstances to bring about a textbook change.  Support staff are often very good, but many, especially in key positions, don't like either students or professors, but are unofficially granted great powers of discretion.  For example, the mail room people don't like professors who get a lot of books delivered to them, and will punish those of us who do by intentionally misdirecting our mail.  Some student advisors have no idea what college is about, and give students just terrible advice (i.e. \"take all online classes, they are always easier.\"), that is sometimes difficult to undo.  You don't get the nice office that is common to most other colleges, you get a corporate style cubby, and our homepage and other computer related issues are spectacularly inadequate.  You can't search for department information or instructor contact information from our home page!  Instructors have no access to statistical software!  After 5 years, I'm still often amazed at how our problems are so unlike other colleges."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Rewarding and pleasant overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Milwaukee, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have worked as both faculty and staff.
