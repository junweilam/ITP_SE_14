I question the motives of Marist administration in that its President will soon be retiring at 75% of the average of his last three years compensation. ANother way that Marist grows its revenue is by admitting freshman that are of questionable academic backgrounds, and, in more recent years, this situation seems to be getting worse as both administrators grow in both number and compensation.
