I loved the overall hospital environment and staff around. I love the food and many of the nurses. Security and transportation were oftentimes super sweet as well.", "cons": "I worked in Pediatrics both Ellison 17 and 18. Below are the detailed reasons I left. 1. Unsafe patient:staff ratio Before I was hired, I was told by the manager that she was working on having on average 4 CNAs on each floor. That oftentimes there are 3 and sometimes even up to 5. I was told to expect that on rare occasions there may only be 2. This is untrue. Most of the time, I was working alone. Working with over 20 patients and without any help. Some nurses will try to help but they are busy so most of the time, you will have to account for all of them. Some times we had 2 CNAs on one floor and 1 alone on the other floor. I sometimes completed my 10 patient assignment and would be requested to then go to the next floor and continue. Also remember, all those patients are children and babies, when you are alone it is a really unsafe work environment. 2. No opportunity to grow, outside of your \"specialty\" I loved working with pediatrics but my ultimate goal was to one day work in another area. I had coworkers who wanted to go to the ER, or different places as well. Some of us would speak to the manager and she would tell us she will not help us unless we worked more time at that floor or would just ignore us. I know this is just the manager who wants to keep everyone there but it is not right. 3. Pay As of November, 2022 everyone was making $19.75 an hour. Manager announced that Overtime and Incentive pay had been removed. Boston Children's pays more, and every other place I know pays more. So for MGH, and the workload, this is embarrassing. 4. The Nurses 95% of the nurses were super sweet. Like mentioned before, if they do not help it is because they cannot. They have a heavy workload as well. But I am sharing these stories to give perspective. - On one occasion, while the nurse was changing a patient dressing. The patient had an accident and the nurse yelled at the patient and me who was holding the patient. Left the room. I covered the dressing which is outside of my practice and apologized on behalf of that nurse. A nurse who always complains and is still working there even after being reported. - One of the nurses, who works on 18. She is a charge nurse often. We had patients who spoke only Spanish and when walking them around the unit as a spanish speaker, I would communicate with them. She would tell me not to speak in spanish, knowing I had to. I later on was told that she targeted hispanics. I do not want to accuse her of discrimination, but she was mean to me and my spanish speaking coworkers on many occasions. I would have to leave babies crying or patients that actually needed me because charge nurse thought it was more important to leave the unit, go to the coffee shop, and bring a 16 year old patient her coffee. Nurses would also leave or send a PCA to get Starbucks for themselves. Then, you are alone on that floor caring for all those babies. That should tell you enough."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good place for training", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great place for research training", "cons": "compensation does not meet living cost in Boston"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Unfair Compensation", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Patient Service Coordinator III in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing patients, providers that genuinely care, clean and well maintained campus", "cons": "Lack of equal pay High turnover rates within departments Understaffed departments, making job more difficult Hiring budget seems to be higher that the retention budget"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great research hospital", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Research Fellow in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "State of the art facility.

Although the nurses were much, much nicer than the doctors, they were very often extremely stressed out and took out their stress on each other or the research assistants through demeaning treatment or confrontations. I'm not entirely sure the stress and the way that the doctors sometimes treated nurses and research assistants was really necessary, since I've worked at several highly functioning labs with reputations just as good, if not better, than MGH, where physicians through research technicians treated each other with mutual respect.\r\n\r\nThe particular lab where I worked in clinical research was a very toxic environment, with employee morale incredibly low, no respect for a work/life balance, and a lack of fairness in how employees were treated. This lab however, is probably one of the worse ones at MGH, and other departments may be much better. Specifically, my immediate colleague had anorexia nervosa, which my superiors had been aware of for some time, but which they did nothing about in terms of making sure she was taking care of herself. The anorexia also meant she was extremely controlling and unwilling to relinquish any of the interesting work to people who were supposed to be her colleagues. I was used to working in labs where people worked as a team, and was disappointed that I and some other junior research assistants were relegated to scutwork. A subdivision of the lab under a few different principal investigators did have research assistants who worked as a team and worked the number of hours that they were paid for (40 per week), however, so my division was perhaps unusual. \r\n\r\nAll of the research assistants at MGH are paid on a set scale, which is more objective, but that pay scale was about $10,000 less than what I would have gotten paid anywhere else--I know this is true, because I left that job after one year, and found a similar job a few months afterward that really did pay $10,000 more per year. In my lab, and probably in many labs, research assistants were given so much work that they had to stay over, sometimes by as much as 30 or 40 hours a week to finish it, and our job contracts/pay structure were such that we definitely did not get paid for this overtime. At MGH I was paid $10,000 less to do twice as much work as I am doing now, while putting up with unprofessional, appalling treatment by my immediate colleague with an anxiety disorder and a principal investigator who turned a blind eye as long as the work got done."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "MGH is really a very good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Staff Assistant II/Library Assistant III in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are some great people (of many nationalities and cultures) working at MGH.

I have heard of at least three situations from different people where they have either been booted or almost booted from the first author position on a manuscript so that someone with more experience in the lab could have the 1st author position, even if this person wasn't very involved in the study. A related positive about the area's misguided authorship allotment, is that there are opportunities to be a random author on a paper even if you didn't play a role in experimental design or analyses.\r\n-There is a LOT of low-level labor associated with these jobs. Expect to do lots of tasks like data-entry, calling participants, managing documentation. There are still opportunities to do cool research, but that is most commonly low on the priority list.\r\n-I guess this can be a pro and a con - but many labs don't have experts in the different modalities that they work with, so CRCs can at times be given a lot of responsibility for analyses (this is a pro, because it can be a good way to get exposure to new tools and gain new skills, but a con because you end up having to teach yourself a lot from literature and there may be times where you have questions but no one in your lab will have the expertise to answer them)\r\n-PIs often have their hypotheses drilled into their head. Because of this, they may want you to redo analyses over and over again with different processing steps until they see something shiny. Sometimes it can come off as a little p-hacky... \r\n\r\nThese comments apply to a decent portion of labs that I have seen, but I would be shocked if they apply to all labs.
