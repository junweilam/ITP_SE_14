You're often set up for failure and then they get mad at you when you don't produce a miracle.\r\nEx: Snowpocalypse in Feb 2021 Methodist waited till 4pm to tell us we were on lockdown. Every other hospital in the area called in their disaster team the day before and were well prepared. Houston Methodist however...... We were not allowed to stay at the hotel across the street, nor go to the store for necessities. We were not allowed to leave for anything, we could not even go to our car to get supplies from it without a security escort. The \"beds\" they provided were cots (many broke during night, or were already broken when received (and you were packed shoulder to shoulder in conference rooms with other employees)), or exam tables that were about as comfortable as sleeping on the hard floor. The \"food\" was worse than prison food. Spaghetti with a tsp of red sauce for dinner, decent breakfast, lunch white bread w/tiny spoonful of pb&j with Oreos or chips. People who could not eat that food went without eating. Many people did not even get an opportunity to shower. If we did not have someone available to bring us supplies, we were SOL. Me along with many others slept in the scrubs we had worn all day, and had to continue to wear them the next day for our shift.\r\nAll they care about is money, patient perspective, and their HCAP scores.\r\nThey take away patient rights and try to convince them that their way is helping them. Ex: Completely alert and oriented patient not on any altering meds, stable vitals, ambulatory, and not a fall risk still MUST have a bed alarm on. If they refuse, it gets escalated to management who then comes and attempts to either brainwash or break them down into allowing the bed alarm. I have had patients from prison say that staying in this hospital is worse than prison. They boast about having a \"patient centric\" culture, but don't actually care what the patient wants or needs. Patients are often discharged too early so they can make room for another patient, only to have the previous patient come back a couple days to weeks later for the same issue that was not fully resolved in the first place.\r\nMethodist wants things their way, and only their way with no regard for what others think or feel.\r\nWe're overworked with little reward.\r\nIf you get injured on the job, they will find every reason not to support you or handle it. They somehow turn the blame to you so that it is not their responsibility.\r\nNo support from upper management, they're honestly just a bunch of snakes. They truly follow the \"customer is always right\" so you get abused on the daily from patients with little support. Management just askes \"What could you have done better?\"\r\nThey don't actually want diversity and inclusion, or follow their values. It's all for show to draw people in and make themselves look good so they can make more money. If you don't fit in their little box, they will find a reason to fire you.\r\nAny research or discoveries you make while working there, Houston Methodist owns and will take credit for.
