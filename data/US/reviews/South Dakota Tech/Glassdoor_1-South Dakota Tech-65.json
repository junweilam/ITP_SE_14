Can't find stuff easily.\r\n-Food is even worse than the website. It doesn't taste like food and will cost you a fortune. The cheapest plan per meal is about $1400 per semester (4 months). And that is a requirement for everybody living in the dormitory.\r\n-Not a highly ranked-university. Very low international reputation.\r\n-Bad preparation for a pre-med program.
