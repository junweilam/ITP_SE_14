I was recruited by a division director (a regular guest at the hotel) to come work at a JRI program in the Boston area. I started out as an Admin Assistant at a juvenile justice center. I worked hard at this new position to make it more organized and improve efficiency and happiness for employees at that site -- luckily I had great managers and mentors to support me. My hard work was recognized and appreciated and when the difficult decision was made to close that program (for lack of state-funding to pay staff sufficient wages), I was offered a position at the JRI corporate office in the accounts receivable department (with really no training or experience in that area). Again, I put 110% into my work to not only learn and do the job, but to make improvements where I could and when I had time. During this time, the company also paid my way to complete my degree, which left me with little-to-no student loan debt afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs the company has exponentially grown (and continues to grow), I was able to be promoted from Accounts Receivable Manager to my current Budget Director role in which I report to the CFO. Meanwhile, my wife and I had two kids in the past 4 years and JRI was flexible enough for me to take some paternity time and then adjust schedule as-needed to meet daycare demands, etc. Next month, I'll have completed 14 years at JRI already and I'm just turning 40 later this year. It's very rare to find these days, but JRI offers a defined pension plan benefit, which means that when I retire, JRI will continue to pay me based on a calculation of my years of service, salary level, and a few other factors (and I don't have to contribute anything to this during my career at JRI). On top of that, I also choose to contribute to JRI's pre-tax 401(k) plan which is matched by JRI up to $800 per year -- so I'm feeling very good about making sure my family is set in my retirement years. Additionally, even though JRI offers excellent health coverage, I'm still on my wife's medical plan at her work, but that allows me to take advantage of another benefit at JRI called the Alternative Health Option, which has paid me an extra $2,000 per year for NOT using JRI's medical coverage -- and once I hit 10 years at the company, that went up to $3,000 per year! Since my wife's plan also has great rates, this pretty much means we get our family health coverage for next to nothing -- we may even make a few bucks on it! Plus, JRI provides free Dental coverage so my entire family is covered at no premium cost to me.\r\n\r\nAll of those things are great, but what I love the most at JRI are the people, the supervisors, and the mentors that I've had. Also, I love the rewarding feeling that comes in knowing that, in some way, my behind-a-computer-screen budget work is ultimately helping to provide excellent services to the many different clients that JRI serves. I do miss being on the front line and interacting directly with clients, but it's a good feeling to know that JRI has high standards for the services we provide and the physical sites where the work is done. I know these are places that I would feel comfortable sending my own kids if necessary. Most of my friends work at for-profit companies, such as PR firms, and I've seen each of them get laid off or have to switch jobs multiple times in the time I've been at JRI. That's not for me. I love the job security and I love being a part of the JRI family, which is all working to make real differences in the lives of young people and families -- and not just padding someone's pockets at the top of a for-profit company. There are many people at JRI that have been here for 20, 30, 40 years or more -- and many are coming up for retirement soon. I'm one of many examples where my hard work has allowed me to move up the chain quickly, and there are many opportunities coming up at JRI. JRI has literally changed my life for the better and I'm thankful every day that JRI found me and I took the chance to move to Boston and start a career with JRI.

Their in-house trainings are well developed to help employees become trauma-informed and focused on meeting individual client needs.  Programs have full autonomy to implement strategies that work best for the individual client.  There is zero tolerance for mistreatment of clients.  Restraints are utilized for imminent risk of harm to self or others and even then JRI trains on the least restrictive restraints, keeping in mind the safety of the client and staff involved.  The expectation is to de-escalate a situation and help a client regulate without going hands-on. \r\n\r\n-Benefits: Great offerings which includes both 401k and pension plan (after 5 years of employment).  Also some really nice partnerships with colleges to assist staff interested in pursuing a career in clinical work.  There are also times when other benefits are provided dependent on company performance such as a year-end bonus and a student loan assistance scholarship.\r\n\r\n-Fulfilling client work: Working with the children is challenging at times but also incredibly rewarding.  It's great seeing them develop while also allowing them opportunities to release the adult burdens placed on them at an early age and re-experience childhood.\r\n\r\n-Reputation: JRI is a strong human services firm and many people remain with the company for the long-haul.", "cons": "-Very political and hierarchical:  The individuals who progress are great at talking the talk to get where they want to be even if their performance isn't the best.  I witnessed many senior leaders visit the program periodically and barely acknowledge anyone who isn't also in a leadership position (not even a simple hello when staff opened the door for them).  Individuals are told to just go along with what leaders say even if they have a question, concern or suggestion.\r\n\r\n-Work in a silo: The culture at each program varies greatly depending on the Program Director and can change drastically when a new Director comes in, with little to no transition.  For example, my program went from one who was transparent, inclusive and developed staff based on their skills and potential, to one who interacted with individuals solely based on their job title and formed their own clique.  Strong performers who once felt optimistic and supported now feel dis-empowered.\r\n\r\nProcesses vary between programs and there isn't any succinct way to proactively and regularly share best practices.  There is an intranet but not every program/department uses it and the content isn't managed well, if at all.\r\n\r\nRapport between some programs and Corporate departments is strained at times.  Expectations vary and cause great frustration on both sides.  There is a significant control issue at the Corporate level -- they don't seem to trust the programs and make employees at the program level feel incompetent.   Corporate departments immediately escalate issues to their senior leaders and will include everyone in emails to reprimand individuals (your role doesn't matter - Program Directors get the same treatment).  While issues need to be addressed, there literally is no wiggle room for even a first time error - they simply go straight up the chain.   You dread emails from corporate because it's usually about something you did wrong, even if you do 99% of tasks correctly 99% of the time.\r\n\r\nThere is very limited insight into the performance, vision or goals of the organization.  There is a once a year publication that is sent out via email, but not all staff have or can access email.\r\n\r\n-Limited career opportunities: The company touts the internal career opportunities and it's particularly inspiring how the CEO literally worked his way from the bottom to the top.  However, opportunities really only exist if you are in a clinical or corporate career path.  If you are in a support role, you typically have to wait for someone to move out of a role (so be content remaining in your role until the person in the role you want at your program retires), find your way into a corporate role (if available), hope you have leadership at your program willing and able to support your development to help you be more flexible for opportunities or be great at smooth talking your way up the ladder.\r\n\r\nPrograms become possessive of staff (I've been told transfers can be blocked by a program) which leads to undermining other programs in an attempt to gain access to strong talent.\r\n\r\n-Drama:  Backstabbing, undermining, and gossip are a significant issue at the program level.  Although relationships among employees is frowned upon, there's no lack of \"icky\" and sketchy interpersonal stuff going on between employees.  Sadly, some are even open about their intent on sleeping around with other employees and will specifically target new employees.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is also theft by employees at the program level \u2013 from large amounts of money to electronics (someone actually walked out of work with a large TV from a program!).  It makes it a challenge to trust your coworkers, which impacts the vibe of the program.\r\n\r\nHR isn\u2019t much help at the program level because they are simply hired as office assistants given basic HR duties.  Hiring, terminations and employee relations are all handled by Program Directors who are untrained on how to handle HR matters while keeping employment law in mind.  Those assistants with actual HR experience (some are certified professionals) are not empowered to utilize their skills and knowledge at the program level.\r\n\r\n-Pay: This is an issue in the non-profit industry overall, however, JRI says they pay competitively, which isn\u2019t the case in most instances.  My program has had many candidates turn down the opportunity because they make significantly more at other comparable agencies.  If you won\u2019t accept the pay offered then you are automatically generalized as someone who doesn\u2019t have a genuine passion for this type of work.  Pay increases are inconsistent \u2013 even if your commitment to work excellence is extremely obvious there is often push back by leaders outside of the program."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "staff", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Jan 2017", "job_title": " in Paris", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work environment is collaborative.

While 32 billable hours was difficult before the change, I now must meet 20 hours (vs. 16 in the old system) before seeing money above a relatively low base pay. As others have mentioned, I am now stressed about taking one day off, let alone more than that, as it affects my whole week. We do not see any incentive in going to trainings anymore, since we aren't compensated over the base rate, and still must make productivity in that week. It was hard enough to take a self-care day before, and now it feels impossible. Enjoying the holidays that JRI observes is nearly impossible since we suffer financially (and end up having to work). Although presented as though we would make more money using this new pay rate, I can only imagine that we would make more money if we were billing 32-40 hours every single week (which really equates to working 60 hours)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Vice President", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Vice President in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Our Division joined JRI through a merger just six months ago.

One of the biggest things that stood out to me when I was in training was the way trainers would encourage self care. \"What are you going to do today for self care?\" Big question during trainings to make sure employees were taking care of themselves because of the emotionally stressful job we have. New compensation model is ridiculous. There were no side by side models handed out to staff to compare the old and the new. Instead, we were given confusing information and told we had to sign the new model immediately. We were told if we billed 40 hours a week for 46 weeks a year, we would make X amount of money. Billing that much for that long is NOT sustainable. We will burnout and quit and JRI will have to train new employees. If we are going to have our basepay hours upped, we deserve those hours to be PRORATED on weeks when there is a holiday, otherwise we have to work on holiday's in order to make enough money that week to pay our bills. New compensation model does not allow me to afford my life if I do not work on holidays, take PTO, or am sick. It is unfair to expect the same amount of billing and taking more money out of our paychecks because of things we deserve. Prorate our hours! I will no longer attend trainings because they are not financially sustainable. JRI prides itself on everything they changed with this new model. This is not what we signed up for as a whole. JRI was rated a top place to work... don't think this will happen in the future and I see a lot of people leaving the program. If I bill 40 hours a week, it really means I'm working 60 with traveling between clients and not being able to bill for speaking with certain collaterals as health insurance does not allow it. Change the model of people will quit. Listen to the employees or you will lose them. Show us side by side models. Don't make the program directors take the heat for changes you make. It is unfair."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "JRI is an excellent company to work for that truly cares about their clients, and their staff", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Oct 2014", "job_title": "APRN in Willimantic, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work is challenging but with lots of personal and professional growth.
