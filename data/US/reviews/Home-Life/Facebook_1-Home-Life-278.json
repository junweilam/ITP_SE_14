Being a job coach allows you to work in a variety of settings, (stores, restaurants, family owned businesses) instead of an office like a regular job. The change of scenery multiple times a day helps the day to go by quickly! You are allowed freedom with your schedule as long as you let the manager know ahead of time. This is a great job for college students! This job requires a lot of driving. You are allowed to use your own car (with mileage reimbursed) or use the company car. You can listen to music while you drive! Most of the time, you are just observing people with disabilities work (your clients) and giving them pointers. You aren\u2019t always hands on with all clients, depending on thier needs and preferences. This helps negate stress by not having to talk all day long.", "cons": "You will only see your co-workers for brief interactions. This can lead to feeling isolated. Often working on skills and tasks with clients can seem mundaine or discouraging when they don\u2019t seem to make visible progress. (I.e. trying to teach a client to clean an appliance more efficiently and they do it incorrectly for weeks or months) Some clients have negative attitudes and may say insulting or demeaning comments to thier co workers or even yourself. This is part of the job -to help them with communication skills, but can be taxing if the issues don\u2019t get resolved after months on end. There isn\u2019t any advancement for the position of job coach. It is ideal for someone who either doesn\u2019t have a degree or wants experience in human services right after college."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Vo", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Paramedic", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great co to work for", "cons": "Better hours and better pay"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Carer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility in hours, face time with some lovely customers.", "cons": "Heavy work load, always chasing your own tail.
