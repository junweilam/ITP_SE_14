I expected that a lot of clever colleagues, who could understand and take an interest in my ideas, would sit down at the lunch table every day to hone our knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith these perhaps quixotic expectations, my disillusionment upon coming to Fresno Pacific was extreme. Not once in my years at Fresno Pacific did I have a conversation with colleagues whose intellectual level reached that which I routinely enjoy on Facebook, on blogs, or in conversations with my highly academic family. One or two of my colleagues were shockingly indifferent to ideas and the life of the mind. Others had a favorable attitude to it, but no habits of rigor or intense curiosity. Nor did I meet anyone at Fresno Pacific who could come close to understanding my academic research, or who took an interest in it, and I very rarely met anyone who seemed to have an active research program that they cared to talk about.\r\n\r\nThe other con, from my perspective at least, is that the wholesome environment seems unlikely to last.
