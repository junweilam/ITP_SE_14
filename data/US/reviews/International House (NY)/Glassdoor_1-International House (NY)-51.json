Most of them don\u2019t care about throwing others under the bus to save themselves. At my office there was a lot of passive aggressiveness, pettiness, and micromanaging from my boss. The in house therapist would talk horribly about you behind your back or reveal things about their patients. I felt like I was being forced out at the end because they would always make comments about me saying I don\u2019t do anything when there was literally nothing to do and they were barely around. 6 of us quit around the same time because of the toxic work environment they produced. Too many people wanting to be king and so they all throw others under the bus to get to the top or keep their own jobs. Also there is absolutely no room for growth, the only way to move up is if someone dies, retires, quits, or is fired. And even then they will most likely bring someone from outside usually a friend of the senior staff."}], []]
