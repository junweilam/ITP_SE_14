Work/life balance was good, in that my supervisors always encouraged me to take lunch breaks and leave on time whenever possible.", "cons": "Kind of feel bad rating it a 2 and not a 3, because there really are some nice perks that I appreciated. But, the negatives are significant. Most people I know who left share that they are working through the impacts of having been employed by SCAD years several later. The gaslighting, culture of fear, and belittlement takes a psychological toll on you, and you leave with some unpacking and unlearning to process. They want to pay you as little as possible and will take advantage of the fact that most staff are younger, don't have much other experience, and don't know how a good organization should treat them. They will discourage you from discussing salary with coworkers, even though federal labor law protects this. If you mention average rates for your role in this industry, they will gaslight you and try to convince you of why you are not worthy. Politics are out of hand. There is a culture of fear that management benefits from. People who have been loyal for years, who have been SCAD's biggest advocates, are fired without warning for no known reason. Staff are scared that they could lose their jobs for reasons beyond their control, and many aim for perfection in what they do because of a fear of losing their jobs if they make a minor mistake. (This rarely actually happens, though.) A focus on perfection may help you keep the job, but it will not help you get ahead. The quality or quantity of your work does not matter in this regard. Your ambition and passion are irrelevant. What gets you ahead is how big of a show you put on in front of people in power. Talking yourself up in front of higher ups and making them feel powerful will get you ahead. If the hard numbers show that you are not an effective leader, this can be brushed off easily if you are one of the \"golden\" people. This is not ideal for those who don't have a tendency to brag or be insincere/manipulative, but want to actually get work done and take pride in it. There are exceptions, but I saw this too often to not make note of it. The focus on appearances was also noteworthy. 90% of student facing roles went to younger staff who are above average in attractiveness and have an on-brand sense of style. There was a lack of diversity in how we look--not in race, but in body type, age, style, and attractiveness. We realized that this was part of their marketing efforts towards students, and it felt objectifying. I have also not seen any women in leadership positions who do not get regular manicures, put on makeup, and wear heals. Women received positive reinforcement for doing these things. Yes, you need to put in effort into your appearance anywhere and look polished--but it felt like too much value was placed on these specific aspects of a women's appearance. (It wasn't policy, just something I saw.) The Covid policy left many staff feeling unsafe, especially those made to return to work in an open work space. These are loud and people are close together. Studies have shown that these layouts do not benefit employees, but SCAD uses them throughout its buildings. Hopefully this changes soon. There is a saying that \"eyes are everywhere\". If you go to a bar and see a student or someone in HR, the unwritten rule is that you must leave immediately. Staff are afraid to have a social life in public spaces, least someone see you and misinterpret what you are doing. People do not feel comfortable speaking their mind about SCAD, even when they are off-campus and outside of work hours. I cannot count the number of times a coworker has glanced around the room fearfully to see if anyone they recognized from SCAD was nearby, before speaking their mind--while in a non-SCAD location on a weekend. Being cautious is smart, but the extent of their fear was unusual. Meanwhile, there are staff that have been known to have inappropriate relations with students who have been protected due to politics. This isn't gossip--these staff members openly and proudly told others of their relations with students. There is a very strange double standard.

Potential students understand that your extraordinary faculty are being driven by a family of leaders that are difficult to work with and do not share the success or wealth of the success. SCAD did it all, not the faculty, no names, only the school's identity. The family takes credit for the outstanding faculty. It is challenging to find pros without the overshadowing cons of this university while working there.", "cons": "SCAD senior management runs the school under fear. Do it their way, or you are out. We are better than everyone. The reviews (fake reviews) are lying. Look over here at how pretty we are. If someone beats SCAD in a review, then there must be a problem with the fake news. Hire performers and have big parties to make ourselves seem important. Take pretty pictures and Photoshop them to make them look perfect. Almost as ignorant as holding a press conference in front of gold elevators.\n\nSenior management will continually ask to make the departments bigger \u201cYuuuuge\u201d with no understanding of quality or sustainability. I was asked by senior MGT: how can we make it bigger? Me: We are 5 times the size or more of our top-tier competitors. Senior MGT: We are better than all of them. Me: With all due respect, there are some good options out there School A does this and School B does this\u2026 I was cut off. Senior MGT: Don\u2019t ever say that again. We can learn nothing from them. We are better. If someone wants to study anything art-related, they should come to SCAD, not there. You really need to stop talking about any other schools you are at SCAD now.\n\nAlthough their approach to immigrants is different than Trumps. They will gladly take them if they can pay the tuition. SCAD has majors for everything possible, even those with minimal job opportunities. Minors for even more and more. Stay for your master\u2019s degree too, as long as you can pay the tuition. New names and new restructures allow for more degrees and buzzwords, but will the students get jobs?\n\nMe: With all the increases, we will need more faculty and support, plus additional space, resources, and computers. We are bursting at the seams, and the building is showing some wear. Faculty are really getting tired and overloaded. We must discuss a growth strategy with the faculty who use the space. Senior MGT: We are already looking into that and have some surprises for you. Focus on making the numbers increase.\n\nAs far as work hours go, you work all the time when the quarter is in session. Some people were teaching 5 to 6 courses a term just to cover the growth. You will be expected to answer immediately, no matter when the request comes in, depending on your responsibility. If you are a leader, then your expectations are 24/7. It is in your contract.\n\nWhen the president arrives, and you will know when she is coming, the place will have people running around swarming like bees to prepare the space, so it is perfect for her arrival. You need to treat her like royalty. If you are allowed to speak with her, you are prepared beforehand and given guidance on what to say. She is not approachable or even interested in what your thoughts are. The process is to follow, with no exceptions. Leaders who accept this lifestyle are put in high positions to watch over the flocks of talented faculty. Good ones get tired and leave if they can. You work so hard throughout the year that it is challenging to look for work because you have no time. Faculty are on a one-year contract only. There is a small window out, and if you break your contract for whatever reason, you are hit with a 5K fee. Considering the faculty pay, this can be a big blow. HR will come after you with collections if you do not pay.\n\nThe school puts resources into showcasing itself very well, but it is not all for the students. Why does the school need a private jet? Why such expensive parties? Why bring in top-name singers to perform for the faculty at meetings? Celebrities flown in to be interviewed and put online for PR? \u201cThe family\u201d is making so much money and the faculty are struggling to pay their bills and live in a safe part of town. It is not cheap to live in a \u201cgood\u201d area of Savannah if you can find one.\n\nSavannah is a depressed town set in a mentality of decades past. Major problems include a high level of racism, poverty, and extremely high crime. Faculty tell stories of gunshots, robberies, held at gunpoint, attacks, and other horrific stories. It is not a safe place. It is not a place for families. The public schools are run down, punitive, and so lousy faculty tell stories of their children crying about how terrible they are. The charter and specialty schools are not much better. Don\u2019t be fooled by the Savannah locals (fake news) who think the schools are excellent. Some of them have never left Savannah and are not aware of modern approaches to teaching even exist. Private is the only option. Just ask the SCAD Leaders where their kids go. When these concerns are brought up to the Senior MGT or HR you are told: Don\u2019t bring this up again.\n\nSCAD is a machine controlled by the top. There is no room for ideas unless they come from the family or are proven to increase student numbers. No sharing of the wealth. No distribution of money down to the faculty or Staff who are making the school strong through guiding the students. The school looks happy and healthy in the pictures online, during visits, and even during short stays.

Leadership of the department treats everyone with a lesser job title with absolutely no respect. \r\n2. Leadership doesn't follow their own rules or advice while expecting you to follow every mandate to the letter. \r\n3. When the CEO of the university is in the building we weren't allowed to walk by the rooms being used or use the bathrooms on the floor being used and weren't allowed to use the kitchen to heat up lunches or get coffee from that kitchen during that time. \r\n4. Never once was I given any sort of positive feedback. Even yearly \"review\"process was based off of completion of delegated tasks- such as watching LinkedIn learning videos on customer service and writing 2 sentences to summarize what we learned. \r\n5. Don't ever be late on a deadline, or do one thing wrong because you will have a one on one meeting with your manager that leads nowhere. \r\n6. Not allowed to work from home ever. \r\n7. No trust placed in employees in any sense. \r\n8. Many weekends required without extra compensation or days off in return. \r\n9. The mind games played by this organization and department as a whole has severely damaged every ex employee's mental health. I know of 3 therapists in the area that joke about sending thank you notes to the university at Christmas time. \r\n10. Only cares about the money brought in by incoming students even in a global pandemic. \r\n11. They look at these reviews and then have meetings denying the things said in them- but everything is true, they just don't want their current employees to know that. \r\n\r\nBottom line:The mind games that the leadership played and the way we were treated has scarred me to the point where I struggled to be positive in my new position.

The caliber of events that employees are encouraged to attend and take part in are through the roof, and super fun. Events like.. Savannah Film Festival, SCAD Style, DeFINE Art, Sidewalk Arts Festival, the Fashion Show.. just to name a few. There is a huge community of people who work at SCAD or attended SCAD and are still involved with special projects with the university. This makes for a great group of friends outside of work. \r\n\r\nI've worked mostly at the Savannah campus, and it is absolutely gorgeous. You can bike or walk all over downtown, and the architecture, trees and squares are so inspiring. A lot of employees bike to work regularly. If you talk to locals in Savannah they will tell you that SCAD has done so much for the city. They have taken so many historic buildings that were falling apart and restored them into beautiful pieces of art. \r\n\r\nDid I mention you can take a class for free every quarter? You have to do a class that works with your work schedule.. which can be tricky.. but you can always do an elearning class. If you don't use your class benefit, your spouse can.. which is amazing!

I admired and respected many of my coworkers and developed strong personal and professional bonds with colleagues in many departments and disciplines. Leaving those friendships behind was the most difficult part of my decision to leave my position with the university.", "cons": "I came to SCAD excited to be part of an innovative, creative, and energized community centered on preparing students to excel in creative fields. I yearned to make a meaningful contribution to my team in these efforts; yet, the occasions when I felt that my contributions were welcomed or meaningful were extremely limited by a controlling and critical administration. In the eyes of the leadership of my department, I seemed to be most useful at performing rote tasks like formatting documents, organizing files, and producing repetitive reports that required no creative or critical thought -- in spite of having two master\u2019s degrees and over a decade of experience in higher education, most of that experience at an art and design college.\r\n \r\nWhen I was promoted to a director-level role in my department, I believed I would finally have the opportunity to draw from the skills and experiences I had cultivated through my own education and career to make meaningful improvements to processes that had become cumbersome and outdated. I had worked hard to build rapport with faculty and academic leadership, and I thought I could build consensus through transparency and clear communication of policies and procedures. Sadly, the opposite was true. All planning and decision making took place at the executive-level, often without consulting me about actions that would directly impact not only myself and my staff, but the university as a whole. I spent my time, including many late nights and most weekends, transferring other people\u2019s work into the correct formats and then refereeing the conflicts created between faculty and administration due to lack of communication. Every day, people were angry with me about decisions that I had no control over, and I received little support or even consideration from the people responsible for the decisions that eroded the rapport I had worked so hard to build over the years. I often had to reverse prior communications regarding deadlines, timelines, and policies because the authority of my position was meaningless when it created any inconvenience for upper administration. \r\n\r\nIn short, SCAD has a leadership problem. Upper administration neglects the professional development of employees with significant experience and potential by reducing them to meaningless data entry or clerical responsibilities. They create an environment that is professionally discouraging through derisively criticizing others\u2019 work, failing to recognize contributions and accomplishments of all but a select group of favorite team members, and showing no awareness of the struggles or aspirations of their employees.

If they have a whim, the school will spend gobs of money to implement said whim... then lose money realizing they didn't ask the people in applicable departments if it would work... ( biggest one that comes to mind, putting neon blue lights along the exterior of the new media building... turns out when you're working with color having everything blue in the class rooms doesn't go over well... but hey it looks cool in advertising photos ).\r\n- If you have been at SCAD over a decade you probably don't see many of the problems new staff and faculty see. There was a day when pay raises were regular and fair and for the most part incoming wages were on par for the area ( if I started 2 years earlier I probably would of made about 25% more ). For the time I was there, each year there was a 2-3% increase across the board (  this was to impress investors, merit didn't play much at all ), but there used to be significant raises averaging around 7%. In addition leave time over the years increases every year you stay... so there are a lot of senior members now that get at least a half a day ever 2 weeks... and I knew of some who took it and still had time for frequent week long vacations... which forces newer employees to pick up the slack. Oh and their used to be paid sabbaticals for all employees after 7 years which vanished in 2009 and replaced with $500 bonus ( which are taxed at 50% in Georgia ) to select individuals in departments.\r\n- It's SUPER tough to take advantage of the free class that comes with full time position. A majority of courses are during work hours ( pretty much ALL graduate classes are ) and you could take online courses, but if you are doing any kind of over time ( chances are good ) you're going to have a hard time find the time / energy to work on assignments.\r\n- There is a lot of talk about making sure the students and faculty are first... if you're staff ( and in most cases faculty ) you see it otherwise. The school spends sooooooo much time making sure it upholds a certain image ( an image defined by 20 something women just out of college / Design group ). This had lead to some very shady practices. One that comes to mind that still happens is the SCAD scholarship fund raising, it's labeled as optional, but supervisors do receive a list of names of people who haven't donated with in their department and are \"encouraged\"  to get you to donate. I've also a couple instances were SCAD will avoid firing someone, but instead putting a person on unpaid suspension or lowering hours  to encourage an employee to quit.\r\n- Oh and there is totally a feudal like class structure. I won't go in too deep on this one as it may be a Southern thing, but there are some higher ups that like to remind you that you're not as important as others... even though we're one big team. \r\n\r\nFinally... if you want to get something done quickly with in the school or potentially change a policy... Have a student... or better yet a visiting professional tweet about it. I've seen this work a few times and it's crazy to me that management is more willing to take action based off a tweet than they are their own employees."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "So close to good.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Savannah, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Students and faculty work well together - some of them are very talented and the culture makes them really strive to develop their work.\r\n\r\nSavannah is a pleasant town, easy to live in and SCAD has made a difference in terms of the influx of students and professors into the community.", "cons": "The administration is run by a parade of sycophants who have risen largely without a trace.

It is, without question, the most toxic environment that I have ever worked in, in over 25+ years. Literally everyone lives in constant fear of being fired at any moment, without warning -- it doesn't matter how smart you are, how dedicated or how successful in your role or area of expertise.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of upper level management are not qualified for the positions that they hold and are in their positions only because of their personal relationship to the president of the college or a member of her immediate family, all of whom hold executive level positions. Their incompetence creates a horrible ripple effect of unnecessary problems and issues for the college as a whole and for those in middle management and below, who actually are qualified and are working tirelessly to do their best for the benefit of the students and their co-workers.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the more successful one is in their role, the more they have to fear. Executive and upper management does not want to be challenged or held to the universally accepted standards for institutions of higher learning. Management is more interested in blindly-loyal foot soldiers than in innovative, qualified and (gasp!) confident administrators or faculty. People who suggest ways to improve, who strive for best-practices, or push for transparency are shown the door and quickly.\r\n\r\nThe work/life balance is exceptionally unhealthy. Staff and faculty are expected to work 50-60 hours a week routinely and even longer hours at several busier times throughout the year. You are expected to have no other interests or activities outside of SCAD. Additionally, if management can figure out how to turn your side passion or freelance successes into something that benefits SCAD, they will lean on you, hard, to do so.  \r\n\r\nAlthough starting pay is often better than other area entry level positions, the regular raises and performance/merit  incentives promised during the interview process, rarely if ever materialize. It is not uncommon to be told that if you hit certain benchmarks that you will receive an increase in pay, only to have the benchmark moved up just before you reach it, or to be told that your supervisor has no recollection of ever having promised you an increase.\r\n\r\nEmployee turn-over is incredibly high, which is discouraging for those left behind. Intelligent, competent and talented staff and faculty would often get frustrated by the horrible work environment, the broken promises, the pressure to behave unethically, the horrendous expectations regarding working hours, the lack of academic integrity, the focus on appearances above substance, and their pay being \"capped\" or being ineligible for raises due to constantly moving targets. The constant change of staff and faculty makes it difficult to maintain a stable and productive work place.\r\n\r\nAlumni and donor relations are both incredibly shallow and disingenuous; there is no interest from upper management in investing in these important relationships. Development staff was given inadequate resources and constantly dealt with unrealistic expectations. It was commonplace for fundraising events to be excuses to spend obscene amounts of money to throw a party, only concerned about the college's image and or PR opportunities, and not to actually earn any money towards the department, program or scholarships that it was meant to go to. By the time I left, management was actively lying to donors and misrepresenting where their donations were going and how their gifts were being used. \r\n\r\nWhen I first started working at SCAD the culture wasn't as ridiculous, damaging or negative as it was when I left. It was very sad and discouraging to watch the college deteriorate over the years, rotting from the inside-out, due to the gross incompetence of management and the deep, deep paranoia that seems to drive everything that they do for the past decade. I held on for much too long, hoping to see it return to its original mission and to once again find its way, only to be disappointed that it continued to get worse and at a more rapid pace. The loss of several qualified high-level leaders in the span of two/three years seemed to contribute to this acceleration; they were replaced by warm bodies loyal to the president and her son and incapable of advancing the college in a meaningful way.

A lot of the policies that they change from year to year or the feedback system that they have us go through is largely arbitrary and we never see any real effect from it. I've tried to suggest changes that would make things easier and more meaningful which would receive praise, but they were rarely acted on encouraged to be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe benefits, although good, could have also been a bit better.

They take credit for the success of their staff who work 60-80 hours a week to meet unrealistic goals when they provided no support or guidance. These so called leaders abuse their staff with late night phone calls, critiques of one's clothing and personal appearance, and will throw anyone under a bus to protect themselves and their secrets. They also treat the President of the university as if she is an empress straight out of the tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes.\" They tell her whatever she wants to hear even if it is false. They skew reports and numbers to please her, and they take every whim she has so seriously that if they hear in passing that she likes the color gray, they will frantically run around campus and paint everything gray. It's nuts.\n\nMost importantly, SCAD is not good for one's mental health. The number of staff treated for anxiety and depression is outrageous. SCAD starts to take over your life and consumes you until you don't even recognize yourself.

People often end up in jobs that they are, through no fault of their own, not at all qualified for.\r\n4. Profs are overworked and underpaid. But, really, that's true everywhere. What's awful about SCAD is that professors are seen as liabilities. They are people who need freedom and support to communicate with students openly and honestly about curriculum...but also about what it takes to become the sort of person they can be proud of. But admin fears academic freedom because it approaches the classroom the way corporate American would. Profs need to become PR people that will stay on message. As a result, academic freedom is non existent. Critical feedback--that could be used to help SCAD grow is stamped out. Faculty are micromanaged, infantilized, rarely praised, underpaid, and yet we are the reason SCAD is great. We protect students from all of the greed that is the ethos of upper management.\r\n6. If you can stay out of admin's way, you'll have a decent experience...for awhile. But I've been straight up lied to so many times that I have to leave. The lies? About salary? About job prospects? About additional work I do that they \"can't afford to pay.\" I loved the students and would have loved to stay, but the admin wears you down. It's tragic because SCAD has so much promise.
