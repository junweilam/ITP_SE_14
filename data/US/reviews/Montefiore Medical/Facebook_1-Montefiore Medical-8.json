Even when someone gives notice of quitting 8 months in advance they refuse to hire a replacement until after that person has left the position. The process to hire takes at least 4 months and the turnover rate is high so you are constantly doing the job of more than one person -floors do not have enough supplies and the hospital gives excuses as to why they cannot stock what is needed to provide patient care -Cafeteria food is unhealthy. We are a healthcare institution and should want our staff to be healthy with good food options. -ED and floors have too many patients. I\u2019m the ED it is unsafe how many beds are stacked together to the point where you have to move 2 beds in order to access your patient in the back of the room. If something happens you are stuck back there and have a hard time getting out. Patients are admitted to the floor without a room and multiple patients live in the hallway although their insurance is charged the same amount as if they had a room. There is not enough staff to serve the amount of patients accepted to the hospital. The patients are angry and uncomfortable about their situation so instead of being able to focus on their healing, you have to listen to them complain about being stuck in the ED or hallway for days. -Employees such as transport and PCTs are hired but refuse to do work and just sit around doing nothing. Managers don\u2019t correct the behavior so providers end up doing their job instead and get reprimanded if patients aren\u2019t taken care of in a timely manner. When you ask this staff to help they give attitude and say they will but then don\u2019t. -The hospital has the highest paid executives in NYC but the lowest paid PAs. Only union workers are adequately compensated so everyone is forced to unionize. No bonuses or yearly raises are given to keep up with inflation. You are overworked and underpaid. -Instead of giving money as a yearly bonus, you are given random gifts such as a cheap coffee mug or water bottle that is made from a chemical that causes cancer. -Employees who work for a hospital should get free health insurance period. I have friends who work at small law firms, in business or tech at corporations who get free health insurance yet my employer can\u2019t provide it. That is selfishness at its core. -Not enough parking for the staff although residents are guaranteed a parking space. I\u2019ve been on the waiting list for 3 years for a space in a community where most of the patients don\u2019t have a car and many of the providers commute via train. I see plenty of empty spaces in the lot that could be given to staff who commute from up north because the salary is not enough to afford NYC rent. -Law firms, tech companies, banks, universities and schools cover fertility benefits 100%. It\u2019s a myth that hospitals give good benefits as I pay more for my benefits than most of my friends from undergrad. -I frequently stay late and don\u2019t get paid overtime. Now in order to get paid overtime the hospital wants us to clock in and out. If you clock in 15 minutes late it gets taken from your vacation time. If you stay 15 minutes late it doesn\u2019t count as overtime. OT only starts after you\u2019ve stayed one hour pass when your shift ends. You are punished for coming late and not rewarded for staying late even though most of the work comes in at the end of the day. The Night Shift team covers 10 surgical services so giving them too much work from 1 surgical service can be overwhelming thus you are incentivized to finish all your work from the day which requires staying late when you work on a busy understaffed service. -When someone goes on vacation on an already understaffed team, everyone is miserable. People should be allowed to take vacation. The hospital needs to be appropriately staffed. Mistakes are made when people rush or don\u2019t have time. -ED/internal medicine is understaffed so they call inappropriate consults to work up their patients which puts extra irrelevant work on the specialty services who are also understaffed distracting us and taking time away from the patients who actually require our specialty care that only we know how to provide -clinic appointments are overbooked so not only do patients wait 6 months or more as a new patient but then when they arrive for their appointment they aren\u2019t seen until hours later because they book multiple patients into one time slot assuming one or more will no show and don\u2019t appropriately staff -pagers are the primary way to get in contact with other staff and it is archaic and not an effective form of communication -toxic staff who bully and degrade others are never fired because of the high turnover rate and understaffing issue -amazing staff who make the work environment a better place never stay longer than a few years because of the above issues -above all the people are who make montefiore a better place to work and provide a better experience for the patient.

Absolutely no one is applying to positions here and as a result hiring managers tell massive lies in order to get people in the door.  The job title you apply for is rarely what you're actually doing.\r\n\r\n2.) Technical decisions are made by business and it shows.  No one on the tech side seems to be qualified or even willing to keep business out of making technical decisions.  The tech stack in nearly every department is a huge tangled mess of various technologies that aren't documented, are poorly coded, extremely fragile and maintained by people who don't really understand how they work.  Technical decision making is almost laughably bad, there is a new project called EPIC being implemented and in the rush to get it implemented as quickly as possible project managers are being asked to purchase hardware for projects without having any software resource requirements or customer usage patterns to work off of.\r\n\r\n3.) A large number of employees are embarrassingly unqualified for their jobs.  In my short time there I ran into \"project managers\" who didn't know what a software development life cycle was.  \"Technical Leads\" who were utterly confused by talk of simple data structures like stacks and queues being used in the very code they were in charge of. \"Software Engineers\" who didn't understand what looping structures were.\r\n\r\n4.) As a result of #3 entrenched employees do everything they can to push out anyone they see is actually qualified.  During my training, and I use the word training loosely, I was purposely lied to about how certain applications were supposed to work.  After a few weeks I just gave up on asking questions and simply started figuring things out on my own since I knew nothing I was told would be true.\r\n\r\n5.) System automation is non-existent, it's considered perfectly acceptable for employees to babysit applications 24/7 when there are a multitude of free solutions for system monitoring available. \r\n\r\n6.) Montefiore IT employees get treated terribly in comparison to hospital and CMO employees.  If you make friends with people over at CMO and the hospital you'll quickly discover that they are treated with much more respect and have better working conditions.  Montefiore IT gets the worst of everything.\r\n\r\n7.) The dress code is ridiculous.  They pay nearly 25% less than industry standards, which is fine because it is a non-profit.  What is not fine is that they expect you dress business casual to work.  Nearly every other company is jeans and t-shirt and will pay you more money.\r\n\r\n8.) The insurance plan was recently changed and it is a disaster if you don't live near the Bronx.  Medical care is free if you go to a Montefiore clinic or hospital but there are two huge problems.  It's extremely difficult to get an appointment, the wait time is nearly 5 weeks in most cases and if you don't live close to the Bronx you have to drive very far to get there.  If you go to a non-Montefiore doctor, good luck,  I've paid more money in the past few months in medical fees than I have ever paid during my time at all of my previous jobs combined.\r\n\r\n9.) Basic things like having your computer setup so you can work properly are not taken care of.  You won't have the ability to get your work done properly because you won't get all of the tools you need to do your job.\r\n\r\n10.)
