In general, there are one too many unhelpful people, and the university needs to work on accountability, peer review, and staff satisfaction.  \r\n\r\nIf you work in the labs, there is a competitive atmosphere in some departments that, combined with poor oversight, sometimes breeds unethical behavior, which impedes collaboration.  This could be resolved with better management and ethics training.  Of course this will vary depending on department and lab. \r\n\r\nPostdoctoral pay uncompetitive, even by academic standards, compared with other local universities such as Stanford.

It's impossible to give a rating to the entire institution, as your experience will vary depending on which campus and department you're in. Parnassus tends to have many more politics and personality issues, whereas the campuses are generally more easygoing. Again, this is a blanket statement and can be totally off depending on who you get, but it's typically true.\r\n\r\nMy department was located at San Francisco General, which is the most inclusive and least political campus (although they still exist here, just not to the degree of Parnassus). I was very fortunate to work in a major clinical department in which I had the support and respect of everyone in the clinical and admin staff, from the bottom to the top. It truly did feel like a loving family, and is extremely rare anywhere in this world but there are some departments at UC that are really doing it right. \r\n\r\nStarting pay is usually okay (not great, but serviceable), but depends entirely on how \"flush\" the department you join is. Some have more money (Surgery, Anesthesia, Medicine) and some have less (Podiatry, Otolaryngology, Optometry).", "cons": "-Raises take a while to go through. You're supposed to receive fifty cents or so every six months, but instead you usually get a buck and some change every couple years, so that can be frustrating. If you feel you've been more than puling your weight, though, you can apply for a merit increase (an unscheduled raise) or a step-up, which is going up in title.\r\n\r\n-Some people can be very unhelpful. There's a tendency among some that if you ask for complex help or for them to teach you how to do anything that even vaguely relates to their job, they believe you're \"trying to steal their job\" and they become very difficult to work with. You mainly see this in departments that have heavy politics and poor management. Departments that cross-train and have a good collegial atmosphere typically don't have this problem and are much easier to work in.\r\n\r\n-Unions can be very obstructive if you hold a union position and are trying to advance in your career. While claiming to get your back in everything, they will do whatever they can to fight your \"upgrade\" to a non-union position, as they don't want to lose your membership (and dues, I'm sure). Many union employees who want to advance typically have to apply for a vacantAnalyst position in their department, or move to a different department, which is unfortunate if you're in a department that you really enjoy."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great, lots of opportunities, a bit spread out, slow HR", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Scholar in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are numerous opportunities to attend seminars and events, which are emailed to you daily.

In my management capacity, I was still being told to act on things in a certain manner that is detrimental to budgetary constraints, but told to do it anyways. Things you want to make better/more efficient is essentially hindered because it doesn't meet their expectations, even though it would remove confusion and barrier of entry for the services. I have a saying-- its the \"UCSF way\" even though UCSF has no clue on best practices by hiring great outside talent.\r\n\r\n- Pay; If you want to be paid like you live in the bay area, good luck. You take the hit here and your pay is literally based on a combination of your experience, your manager's pay and your subordinate's pay. You have to be right in the middle, and make sure you don't step on anyone's toes because that's not equitable. BTW, its definitely not equitable that the director's pay is 2x yours.\r\n\r\n- Colleagues - there is definitely the mentality that you are here to collect your check, go home, and retire in 20 years or so. There is no drive or ambition to make the university better, even if you try, you end up in the perils of university politics because no one wants to do more than what they feel like doing. And in succession, forget any upward mobility.\r\n\r\n-Lack of coordination: if you work for the campus side like in this review, you are the scraps. You are not UCSF Health/UCSF Medical Center. You don't matter. You don't have money nor resources. You fight for everything you need/want while UCSF Medical Ctr/UCSF Health basks in the glory.\r\n\r\n-University employees: I have never been disrespected by own employees in my life like the way these folks suck the blood out of your soul. I deal with the most uptight, obnoxious, uptight, privileged people because they feel that I owe them something. So much so, I've called university police on these very people multiple times which is crazy because you would think, this is a work environment,  things are dealt civilly, but to call on your own police department to deal with privileged UC employees is definitely not normal.

Don't complain about how some are more lucky than others. Use your brain. You make your OWN luck in life. Focus. Put in the time and energy, and you will reap the rewards.\r\n-If you do get promoted, please keep in mind that UCSF imposes a 25% pay raise cap on their employees. Which means that you cannot earn more than 25% raise of your previous salary each year without UCSF Board of Reagents Approval.  Since salaries often eat up the majority of any company's costs, they do this to control their costs. You can beat this if you provide solid evidence why you deserve more, but it's not an easy thing to beat.\r\n- Pay could be better. But lets be honest, everybody wishes they made more money no matter where you work. It doesn't matter how much we make. What's more important is how you save your money through focused discipline and spend wisely throughout the years. Always pay yourself first. Always put yourself first. Never throw money away on stupid girlfriends/boyfriends, credit cards, lavish cars, overpriced trips, and you will be ok. Enjoy your life today, but be smart. Live within your current means  and plan for tomorrow too. And always pay down your student loans as QUICKLY as possible.
