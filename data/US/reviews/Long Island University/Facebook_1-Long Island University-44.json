How the role is constructed makes it seemingly impossible to get your job done without staying late daily. You are asked to do the job of about 4-5 different people at any other university. Values & Culture: As an institution, LIU does not seem to value its student affairs professionals. They are overworked and underpaid. In this position, I lived on campus, where I had to pay rent and serve \"on-call.\" While other professionals that lived on campus solely paid rent. There is no opportunity for OT, and you are expected to frequently work during evenings and weekends, with in-frequent comp time. The Dean of students often called the office director to ensure staff was working late. You are expected to answer emails until about 9 p.m. Values & Culture: The institution is focused on bringing in as much tuition as possible and does not seem to care about students. As someone who cares significantly about treating students well, this job will create experiences that may directly conflict with the ideal. Diversity and Inclusion: This was only a performative focus when I was here. There is no interest in making belonging a focal point of the university (for students and staff). Senior Leadership: It was clear that senior leadership was only concerned with the bottom line, i.e., how much the university made. Student Support: The lack of student support in other areas of the school makes this job that much harder. The frequent turnover of student support staff makes the students distrustful of the staff in place. Also, the lack of staffing in other areas of the school places a heavier burden on those within the role.

The education is non-existent and many of the professors are extremely unprofessional. I attended as a freshman in the new RocNation program for only one semester before transferring somewhere else. While none of the programs are of any quality from what I\u2019ve heard, RocNation is especially poor considering it is being sponsored by Jay-Z. I don\u2019t know where that money is going, but it\u2019s certainly not being used to improve the RocNation program or the university in general.\r\n\r\nNot only is the education EXTREMELY poor (especially for the amount you are paying), the campus is absolutely foul. While it may look nice in the outside with its greenery, the inside of almost every building is run down and just disgusting. Connolly Hall is literally falling apart, I knew a girl whose ceiling collapsed. The bathrooms were not maintained well in most floors, the 13th floor bathroom has black mold growing in the showers. They often \u201ctested\u201d the fire alarms, even at 3a.m. on multiple occasions, but we never had a single fire drill or were even briefed on what to do in that situation. One of the most concerning aspects of the facilities was the basement of the Metcalfe building which is completely abandoned and run down not to mention unsafe (electrical wires hanging, mold and mildew, crumbling foundations, etc.) , yet still easily accessible to any student who happens to walk that way. I discovered some truly disturbing things down there purely on accident. \r\n\r\nMost of the staff is entirely unhelpful in every conceivable way. If you need to figure something out with a class or financial aid, each person you speak to will just send you to someone else who also doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe food is absolutely disgusting and there are few options. Most times my friends and I would just end up eating cereal for every meal unless we got lucky and there was mac and cheese or something. The food would get especially bad on weekends which was also frustrating because the only on campus restaurant (Freshens) is closed on weekends, so even if you want to use dining dollars to get a decent meal when the dining hall is especially foul, you cant. I paid $2000 for that meal plan and I mostly ate cereal and sad salads because it was all that was edible.\r\n\r\nI cannot stress enough how awful this place is. I could go on and on, there were so many issues that were experienced by many people I knew there, not just me.

Mass layoffs on day one of NY state forcing the campus to close. They practically punished staff for having to work from home, giving everyone ridiculous, \"Productivity,\" spreadsheets to fill out that had to account for how you spent every minute of the work day from home, with several enigmatic fields to fill in that were never explained. People who didn't fill them out correctly enough were unceremoniously fired. The minute the state opened, we were forced back into our cramped office spaces and given zero masks or gloves. It took weeks for sanitizer to arrive.\r\n\r\nI think you get the point. LIU doesn't care about its employees and hardly cares about its students.

In that instance I emailed the corresponding pages in the Collective Bargaining Agreement to the Assistant Dean who investigated the matter with Academic Affairs and I was paid. \r\nIn 2017 there was a delay of 2 months in sending the appropriate paperwork from my department to HR to start getting paid. \r\n\r\nIn the last 60 days I have emailed and received absolutely no response from:\r\n- Payroll, HR, the HR Representative who signed my assignment letter\r\n- Every high member of the School where I taught including the Dean and Assistant Dean who asked me to teach and any assistant or secretary that was involved in my teaching appointment and pay\r\n- A LIU Board of Trustee who should be concerned as a former local politician\r\n- A LIU Board of Trustee who is also faculty\r\n\r\nI contacted the Union and they have been very responsive to me but it appears that they are being ignored by the school as well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, apparently contracts mean nothing to LIU Post. Please be forewarned.\r\n\r\nI will update if and when I receive the correct calculation for my services delivered. However, after all this time and so much correspondence,  I am not hopeful."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good programs, horrible culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Brooklyn, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Expanding skill sets, working with different groups of people, professional development, keen to hiring in source, salary okay, benefits okay, lots of room for growth", "cons": "Incompetent people with no training, a lot of work expected from one person (1 person will have 4 positions), bad culture, people resign quickly"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Not bad for students", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Jul 2010", "job_title": "IT Lab in Brooklyn, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunity for a student needing extra money to survive the expensive costs to attend the school..Positions available in Admissions, MyLIU, IT, Library, etc..", "cons": "Payroll office doesn't seem to know what they're doing, lack of up to date equipment in the IT area, politics as usual"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "A physical Educator", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 May 2019", "job_title": "Fitness Representative in Brooklyn, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great experience, a great opportunity for a college student that are seeking any experiences", "cons": "some of the downfalls of working as a fitness representative that I shared working in this complex is that you will experience some turmoil during the payment period. sometimes they're late."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Tenured Associate Professor - worked 10 years at LIU Brooklyn", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "23 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Associate Professor in Brooklyn, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Convenient location in downtown Brooklyn.
