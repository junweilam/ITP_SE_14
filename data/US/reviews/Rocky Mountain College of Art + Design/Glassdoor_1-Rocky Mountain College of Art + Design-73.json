Because the pay is so low for the amount of time you need to put in you find yourself answering students and grading projects so quickly that you absolutely cannot give your best effort unless you want to be making minimum wage or less per hour of your time. The class you teach is fully online through an LMS (learning management software). You have to grade students twice a week 2- 3 projects plus with 20 students each. You have a fast deadline on grading so you are basically grading all week. They ask you to do at least 10 hours per week but you will find doing 10 hours means you are doing less than the absolute bare minimum. I was working so many hours for them that my other college courses suffered. I am paid 3 times more at the other colleges but just could not get to them fast enough and finally it showed on my review so I had to leave Rocky.

There are also really great coworkers that uplift the job.\r\n\r\nI have had a lot of time to develop and learn as an artist here and have made a lot of great strides in my own professional growth. I appreciate the challenges that are presented from students to get out of my comfort zone and learn new methodologies.", "cons": "Where do I start. The admissions at the school is predatory to incoming students, the fact that RMCAD has a 100% acceptance rate should be a huge red flag to any prospective students. I\u2019ve had students who have little to almost no experience with technical skills that are absolutely necessary and foundational to being successful. Having them be accepted without those skills is to disregard their actual ability to succeed in classes or post grad. These students are paying literally tens of thousands of dollars to take classes, if they cannot perform then teachers are forced to fail them. In my experience the foundations classes are not hard enough on students and pass them into the upper level classes regardless of skill so they\u2019ve already been saddled with 5 or more classes worth of debt, making them feel that quitting the studio classes that fail them is a sunken cost. \r\nThe justification for this from admin is \u201canyone can be an artist\u201d, which is absolutely true but to charge an incredible premium (70k to 100k for the degree) for jobs that have specific skill level requirements is immoral. These students would have to close the gap of needing 5 to 10 years of drawing practice all while being under incredible pressure for deadlines, learning new programs and working jobs to live in the insanely overpriced housing that exists in Denver is absurd. \r\n\r\nThe eight week format is incredibly toxic to students and is completely insane to expect students to cover the amount of material that was originally written into the 16 week schedules pre-2013. The class work schedule is overwhelming and expects students to pour in the same amount of work required for an 16 week class on top of their regular lives and jobs.\r\n\r\nIf you are seeking working at this school remember that the bulk of instructors are adjunct, meaning you get no benefits and are at the whim of the dept lead. The curriculum is weak and has required me to pour many many hours of my own free time into rewrites and supplemental materials. There is an expectation on teachers that you will do this.\r\n\r\nIf you are seeking attending this school, consider your own skill level and ability to perform in an intensive field. If you are still learning how to draw basic boxes or humans; go back to the basics on YouTube and instructional books and learn in your own time for free. If you cannot buckle down to build your foundations then you will likely be unable to do so in this setting. \r\nRMCAD can perhaps be a good choice for those who have financial backing from an outside source but many students leave with student loans anywhere from 20,000 upwards to 90,000+ in debt. This is insane for an art school, this is not a medical degree, this is a degree that likely will give you a mediocre paying job out of school, or even for five to ten years post grad. There are not very many instances of people making 80K+ in the arts, esp in the field I teach.  The alumni services exist but is a bit passive, especially in departments that are not interior design, graphic design or photography. \r\n\r\nWhile I still work at this school I have seen improvements in many ways but the admissions team feels more akin to the Art Institutes than what the University used to be. I hope that the school will eventually go back to the 16 week format and be more selective in students that are admitted but I\u2019m not holding my breath. These two things reflect the true intentions of a For-Profit University."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Instructional Designer in Lakewood, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful instructors who care about their students", "cons": "tech can sometimes be inhibitive"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It\u2019s recruiting - not admissions", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Admissions Representative in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Peers were good coworkers\r\nGood salary\r\nThoughtful exit interview", "cons": "Horrible management\r\nMicro-managed\r\nNot clear job description or offer\r\nYou are cold calling students, not actually helping with the admissions process of *admitting* students \r\nRMCAD accepts everyone and they hold their students\u2019 hands through the entire process\r\nYou are a babysitter, not a counselor"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Admissions", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fun rewarding Job working with students. \nGreat coworkers.\nSenior leadership gave autonomy to those who earned it.", "cons": "Smaller school so some departments are understaffed."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Growing and Supportive", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Growing fast and supportive of adjuncts.", "cons": "Could be better organized - online course development - but improving."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Student", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Game Designer in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Staff, great school, effective curriculum .", "cons": "no post-grad offered at this school"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Can not pay vendors yet can deliver events", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2016", "job_title": " in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Grear people and question who is in charge, since no budget, no business model and they are puttling all enrolled and employed making a dfference in the future of their educational model at risk\r\n\r\nDo not have events and invite those you owe money to the event when they question why a big event  when you can not pay us?", "cons": "Do not think that everyone is there bank, from vendors to employees.
