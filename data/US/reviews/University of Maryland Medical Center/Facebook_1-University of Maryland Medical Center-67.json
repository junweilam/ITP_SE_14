It has always been understaffed and the lab would offer pay below market value, so we would have a hard time hiring and retaining staff. They would literally offer prospective employees pay cuts. During the start of the pandemic, the lab operations leadership tried so hard to make sure we did not get Covid pay. Employees had to fight back and go to HR in order to get it. Which took over a year. Our benefits were reduced(no more sick pay, lower differentials, and PTO was reduced), we also have to pay for uniforms and parking. We used to have a flexible start time as long as you were not on a STAT bench, but that was taken away due to it not being \u201cfair\u201d to the other labs. However we are expected to stay hours after our shift if the work isn\u2019t caught up, the other labs do not have this expectation. We get less break time than the other hospitals as well(45 minutes compared to an hour at all the other lab locations) . They keep bringing in more work to the microbiology lab but aren\u2019t being proactive enough when it comes to getting better instruments and benefits to attract employees. Becoming an MLS III has gotten significantly more difficult for no reason for internal employees. However they keep hiring new people as MLS IIIs, including people who aren\u2019t even ASCP/AMT certified. Additionally, non certified employees are making more than certified employees in some cases, which is not right. Lastly, the lab director is not present since they direct multiple labs. I only see them a few times a year.

They was trying to frame Me for things my coworkers did. The coordinator even lied and claimed I threatened her, and the supervisor claimed she called human resources as well and told there manager and when I called human resources, they said they never heard of this. They even bring alcohol to work during Christmas parties. The lead phlebotomist gave us all liquor which Karen dubose and wendy wiley was there and they allowed everyone to drink it. And this was in the 3rd floor conference room.\r\n\r\nBullying exist there as well. I been bullied/and or disrespected by coworkers and management. so many people and cursed out for years and nothing never happened.\r\n\r\nThe supervisor and coordinator will twist up ur words and make it seem as if I started it even tho I'm the one who reported them. They was hating on my growth because I'm in college to become a nurse, the supervisor underpaid me for years. \r\n\r\nShe would give me a 3 to 5 cent raise every year and ive been there for 11 years so u do the matter of how much i was paid. I even was sexually harassed by the supervisor in the microbiology department a few years ago in front of my coworkers and old coordinator. \r\n\r\nThe supervisor gonna tell me I'm lying on that manager. They are also falsifying records. They will add things in ur record and claim that they talked to u about things and never did, or the coordinator will write things up and word it as like u are the one who started the bullying when u are the one who called and reported it. She is a liar and a snake.\r\n\r\nThey will tell all your business out, nothing is confidential. If u have medical problems, or anything they will tell everyone. There is no confidentiality in that department. People even know when someone is about to get fired before it happens.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo many people are quitting in this phlebotomy department left and right because they are being over worked underpaid, disrespected, and they have to service covid patients without covid pay. They even have phlebotomist doing iv starts and no one in the department is certified to be an iv\r\n technician. \r\n\r\nSo many people are afraid to speak out, I used to be scared but not no more. I do not recommend anyone working for that department. You will regret it and dont say I didnt warn u. Management talks about everybody to everybody.\r\n\r\nI think god I resigned, without a backup plan, I have a peace of mind and feel protected.\r\n\r\nOne thing ive learned is not to sign nothing. I used to sign things a lot because I thought if I didnt I would lose my job and I loved working for this hospital. The patients nurses doctors everyone else brighten up my day. U do not have to sign things they give u. Don't let them fool u and tell u, u have to cause u don't. Don't sign nothing that has lies on it thatt manageement atyped up.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother thing is they was giving us 1 face mask per week to go in patients rooms it took them over a year to give us a box of face masks.
