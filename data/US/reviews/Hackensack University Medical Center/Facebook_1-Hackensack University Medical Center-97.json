Always implement new ideas that never fall through. \r\n\r\nVery biased management team that have favorites and provide little to no training to new research employees. You are basically set up for failure before you start. Training is so bad and they are quick to blame you for anything that goes wrong AND expect you to learn things on your own for the most part and give you things to do  even when they know you have not been trained to do so.\r\n\r\nThe pay is very low for all the work and numerous studies they want you to work on and some of the PI's have empty ego's  larger than than the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the Clinical research Nirses have favorite coordinators who are still there and haven't moved up the ladder. No growth for career advancement! \r\n\r\nWARNING to future Research ApplicNts: if you want to SLAVE away as a Clinical Research DATA Coordinator with low pay, then go ahead and apply at this institution.
