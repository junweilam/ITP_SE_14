Until then I had no complaints regarding my work and was named one of the \"Outstanding Graduate Assistants\" in 2016. The director of the Schroeder Center contacted me directly in June, 2017 to inform me of an upcoming grant and open position. During the phone call describing the position, she used the phrase \"I can write the position for you.\" During subsequent (verbal) conversations she indicated that an employee benefit of the position would be the ability to take one class per semester at the College with waived tuition. In January, 2018 she denied my request to take a class in the Mathematics department, stating that it would interfere with my working schedule. Furthermore, I received additional communication from W&M Human Resources that this benefit was restricted to those who had continuous Virginia residency for 2 years. \r\n\r\nHad the residency requirement been made publicly available anywhere on the W&M website, I would not have taken the position, as I had already interrupted my class schedule at the Harvard Extension School which was paid for by my previous employer. \r\n\r\nSubsequent performance reviews to HR included remarks about the frequency of using the restroom (and I quote, \"sometimes leaving his desk twice in one hour\"), and then stated one instance of excusing myself during a two hour meeting as a failure to meet job performance standards. Advice on how to improve performance was limited to \"searching the Stata User guide\" and to \"follow my instructions to the letter.\" During the last two months of my employment, I consistently sought feedback on work and was given inconsistent responses. \r\n\r\nOn May 31st, 2018, I was terminated from my position at the Schroeder Center for Health Policy at William & Mary, with no severance and requiring the continuation of $778 in COBRA payments to continue my insurance coverage. Human Resources was incredibly unhelpful during this process, first stating that I would receive *no* coverage during the month of June, only to later state that I would receive retroactive coverage. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, the director of the Schroeder Center has been condescending, micromanaging, and manipulative during both the interview process and my subsequent employment."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good work/life balance, impressive colleagues", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Associate in Williamsburg, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Plush, well-funded small liberal arts college.
