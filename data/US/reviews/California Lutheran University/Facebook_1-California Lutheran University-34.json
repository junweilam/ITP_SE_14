Ideas that come from enrollment and marketing are must be adopted by the rest of the administration with little to no collaboration.\r\n3) Financial executive management is scruge-like.  Everything is judged in dollars and cents with little understanding that not everything that contributes to the value and growth of a University is monetarily quantifiable.\r\n4) The institution is backwards in some ways.\r\n- For example, in some lots, commuting students can park where staff park and so staff need to compete for parking with students.\r\n- Tuition remission discount is the same for an employee whether they've worked for the school for 1 year or 10 years... doesn't matter.  This doesn't help loyalty and makes it easy for people to jet in to get a cheap degree and then leave.\r\n- No common sense to which buildings get updated first.  Enrollment building, facilities building (which public doesn't see) where both updated years ago while the Administration building (where President's office is), the Business Office (where almost everyone must go), and Public Safety remain almost as they were originally built decades ago.  (They are finally updating HR.)\r\n5) Little to no encouragement for new ideas.
