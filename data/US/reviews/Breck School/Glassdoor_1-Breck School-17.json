Majority of parents spoil their children and let them off the hook often, thereby ironically interfering g with the education of their children. The administration allows this to occur because it is detached, stoic and numb. The administration  wishes  to appear supportive so there is a lot of lip service by the administration  to the parents and to the teachers in front of the parents, followed by backstabbing  by the administration to the teachers. The only survivors are the teachers that are brown  nose-era. EVERY teacher, and employee for that matter walks around on egg shells because, no matter who the headmaster is, people historically get the axe very suddenly without warning. It has been  a secretary employed 20+ years, a school counselor of 15 years, a janitor of 6 years. Actually there is a bitter  teachers union formed in the 1980's against a crazy headmaster, so the classroom teachers are harder to fire- but they do get fired. For example, a teacher was fired for being pregnant out of wedlock, so it was rumored. MANY sexual  scandals in the school historically and currently."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Assistant Teacher", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Assistant Teacher in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work environment, great school!
