The academic environment at Wofford provides for stimulating conversations, and the Spartanburg area is growing rapidly in terms of weekend outing possibilities and stuff to do on weeknights.

Also, most people I worked with ended up working more than 40 hours a week and often worked \"on call\" hours as well.  Also on the down side, there is little inter-department interaction so staff members may still be meeting other staff members 8 months into the year and may even finish the academic year without having gotten to know entire department teams.
