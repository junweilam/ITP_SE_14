Also the new finance system implementation has been a complete sh$&show and increased everyone\u2019s workload substantially. Lots of people who\u2019ve worked for the university for many years are taking early retirement because of the new (micro)management system and the ridiculous finance system. They are now suggesting that we take an \u201cAccounting 101\u201d training to be able to understand their convoluted system. We are not accountants nor are we paid enough to be, we are supposed to be supporting the professors and students but we\u2019re so busy doing finance stuff that we have little time for helping the actual work of scholarly research and educating students happen. Poor leadership at the highest levels has allowed this to happen (Barchi, I\u2019m looking at you). And the lack of respect shown at the bargaining table this year makes it painfully obvious that management gives less than two sh$&s about us. We do have great benefits, but they\u2019re trying their hardest to take them away at every turn.

If you are a TA or grader in MAE department, I feel sorry for you. The underfunded department abuses the TA/graders to the fullest extent possible. While the mandated contract is for 15 hours per week, TAs are forced to work for +30 hours more often than not. While this may work for MS students, the cost-benefit analysis for PhDs is entirely unjustified. PhDs are supposed to do research. Even with a 75 hour work week, the time left to do research after considering coursework and TAs is a meager 35 hours. Good luck with finishing your degree with a 35 hour work week. What is especially sad is the sheer indifference that professors show towards this abuse. If the graders and TAs decided to come together and complain to the Dean or higher, pretty sure MAE will be in big trouble. Alas! most graduate students are internationals, with no knowledge about the redressal system and indeed scared of being suspended by the school and sent back.
