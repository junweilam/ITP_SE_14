The campus is small and cozy, a charming setting in a small town in the Appalachian mountains.  It was especially beautiful in the fall (changing leaves) and spring (blooming Redbud trees). I miss the camaraderie with colleagues from other departments and the get-togethers and social events, but that's about it. There were some surprisingly good people working there and I have not experienced such close-knit and supportive social groups elsewhere.", "cons": "This was the most dysfunctional place I've ever worked. The place was a revolving door - the highest turnover rates I've ever heard of for higher education.  I think yearly turnover must rival fast food jobs. Faculty usually like to plan their syllabus and course schedules ahead of time, but it was impossible here. We often did not know final teaching schedule until weeks into the semester. On occasion courses were cancelled due to low enrollment up to 3 weeks into the semester, or courses were switched weeks into the semester (sometimes due to the need to take over a course when adjunct or fulltime faculty quit right before the semester started, or even during the first week or two of the semester).  Due to lack of fulltime faculty, teaching loads were often high (it was not unusual for some faculty to be teaching 7, even 8 courses in a semester) and there was often a reliance on many part time adjunct instructors teaching courses.  If teaching 8 courses and doing it well sounds impossible, you'd be correct.  Often these adjuncts were not vetted well, as departments were desperate to cover courses.  Some departments only had 3 or 4 fulltime faculty but up to 20 or more adjuncts. Sometimes faculty were pressured into teaching low enrollment courses for very little or no money - as little as a few hundred dollars for a semester-long seminar course with several students.  Some faculty reported being threatened with negative performance evaluations if they did not agree to teach an extra course for free. There were a myriad of other problems as well.  Students definitely \"ruled the roost\" here, and faculty were absolutely not allowed to set standards without administration intervening to appease students.  Some graduate programs were awfully close to being a degree mill, with students taking online courses that were not graded very rigorously if at all.  Many employees were alumni of the college and thus probably did not realize that other institutions just do not operate this way. These problems did tend to have the result of making faculty band together and form a kind of support group. \r\n\r\nBesides all of that, salaries were quite low; some of the very lowest faculty salaries in the entire country if not the very lowest at one time."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Communication was poor and loyal employees were not valued.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Assistant Professor, Tenure Track in Barbourville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small, beautiful campus.
