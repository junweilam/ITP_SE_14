They just got absorbed by staff still there. Administration won't be held accountable for their incompetence or their outright sabotage of new and creative ideas; in fact, they get protected. This place is living in the past with no clear sense of its identity and future. Why? \"Because,\" you'll hear, \"this is who we are.\" No matter that the times have changed. Staff salaries have remained static as well. No raises in last few years. There are even employees with master's degrees making $13/hour, below living wage. Nevertheless, Pres. Melby continued to receive a $20,000+ salary increase each year of her tenure (you can easily find school's tax records online to show this). In other words, values and practices do not line up. It's an unhealthy place to work. Work here and after some years you, too, will feel the ill effects mentally, emotionally, and physically. I say all this after having loved so much of my job. Just not a healthy place.Feels like a sinking ship. New president, new mission statement won't change that. Etc.
