Managed 400 plus people high turn over.  On my first day of work I was told that there was a hiring freeze and that I now would be handling the work load of two employees but this would be temporary. At this point I had signed my agreement and had no choice in the situation but to wait it out.I later found out that the employee that was supposed to start with me was the employee hired in my 9th month and that she had been informed by my manager that she would not be hired prior to my initial start date. My manager and hr with held this information from me it was a very shady situation.     \r\n\r\n During this time I had little to no training on how to do my job. I was overwhelmed by the amount of work I was expected to do. I also was told that 20 percent of my time would be spent assisting in a critical area of the hospital. Another lie, I spent over 50 percent of my first 6 months covering this area (4am-5pm) my normal working hours were suppose to be 8:30 am-5:00 pm I rarely worked that schedule. I worked this position made for two employees for 9 months. I was ranked highly effective and received a yearly bonus. During my 9 month my manager was cleared to hire another team member and my manager received a promotion. \r\nat this time my managers attitude completely changed. My manager became rude and very condescending attempted to use threatening tones and body language to intimidate me regularly. No less than one month of being ranked highly effective my manger called a meeting with me and told me my next quarter would be less effective. My manager then began sending unnecessary text messages and calls to my personal line during non working hours. One time my manager called my phone at 3 in the morning to ask me to report to work shortly there after. I obliged and reported to work. At this point I asked my manager to stop contacting me on my personal phone via text and calls as I felt violated. My manager then became very unprofessional and began to pick at my every move. I was gifted a half day by my managers superior and emailed my manager the day I planned to use this half day. My manager then pretended she never got my email and called my personal line and yelled at me as though I was a child. (I was told \"I can't watch everything you wear and do in a very nasty tone.) The following day I reported this phone conversation to my managers superior. My manager's superior then scheduled a meeting with my manager and I, where she asked me to sign the less effective paper work that she had been planning to give me at the very beginning of the quarter. Nothing was ever done to my manager for her unprofessional behavior in fact she was allowed to put me on a disciplinary plan. Upon completion of this plan I was again ranked highly effective and it was work as usual. No less than a month later my manager went on a hunt to find people who would report that i was an ineffective worker. I was then sat down with HR professional and my manager to discuss a 30 day plan of action. This is the day I resigned. There was nothing that I could have done to prevent being fired as the odds were stacked against me from the very beginning.

Upon hire like I said in the pros section great team dynamic great support, but things changed. I have now been working for the General for two years now going on three, and I have noticed not only a change in the work environment, high turn over rate, staffing situation, high nurse burn out, patient acuity vs. nurse to patient ratio, poor organization, and poor management. But, what I have noticed is a trend in nurses not having a voice when it comes to situations that need to be spoken on or things that need to be handle on the unit that needs improvement. On the unit I work on I felt as a nurse I did the best I could, going to work everyday giving 110 percent staying late nights, and still I felt like my work and what I did is not good enough and management made me feel as if I wasn\u2019t giving my all when I do all I can do for my patients. I take my job very seriously I am very passionate about being a nurse and caring for people, it\u2019s part of my life, and it saddens me to feel as if I am not being given the credit for what I am doing especially when I am giving my all, and I will be the bigger person and speak for my team because if it wasn\u2019t for my team of nurses on my unit I don\u2019t think I would have stayed as long as I did those ladies and men are amazing from the nurses, telemetry techs, cardiac rehab, PCA\u2019s, Lab techs, doctors, EVS workers, dietary, and transporters; the credit is given from my voice because I think we deserve it. I know every hospital has its flaws, but at some point they need to be fixed. Also, addressing management I know times can get touch but we need leaders that will tackle situations good or bad, big or small, and most of all making there employees feel valued. As a team we have spoken up and still I see failure in things that are not being improved. To list those things, staffing I know we have to hire to get staffing but also patient ratio, acuity, and nurse burn out is a problem. To address this I think the hospital is forgetting the bigger picture, the well being of the patients and safe patient quality care. On the unit I work on the patient acuity is very high, very fast pace unit which; I love the pace, but what is not being address is patient load and patient acuity. Error is liable to be made if you give for example, one nurse 2-3 open heart patients that need practically one on one care that has a max of 6 total patients while being continuously slammed with admits and discharges, organization is definitely a problem. Nursing assignments are definitely a work in progress. Nurse burn out is not only bad for the nurse but is very very harmful to the patient, and nothing is being done about this issue. Delegation, communication, leadership, advocacy, and organization is the key. If the hospital does not fix these areas it will carry over to the next facility that is in the progress of being opened, and high turn over rates will continue to be an issue due to nurse burn out, but also patient safety concerns. It does have an effect it might not be an issue now, but it is a growing problem, and if it\u2019s not the employees management needs to be addressed. Look at the bigger picture what is creating these issues. With that being said I do love what I do as a nurse, and it does carry over into my everyday life this is not just a job for me it is truly a passion, and I will speak up where change and rights that need to happen, and will always fight for the better as long as I am a nurse and as long as I live, I will be the voice of reason. Once again thank you Baton Rouge General for the opportunity to work for your organization and for the experience I have gained at your facility it is greatly appreciated, and I will carry that with me through my advancing nursing career."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Started well", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Helpdesk Technician in Baton Rouge, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GPT to use for anything you want is nice.
