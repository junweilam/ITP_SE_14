The work environment is just so messy. Leave a bunch of IT guys together and see the place turn into filth in a day. It's small, cramped, depressing.\r\n3. The pay is horrible. Any other place you'd be payed about twice as much, but the very broke University exploits students who can't work off campus due to restrictions (Internationals) by paying minimum wage.

People in Administration get paid a lot more than people on the Academic side, how is this possible when the main \"business\" is driven by Academics? It has all the hallmarks of a State run entity.  And, we have the totally outdated Civil Servant model for employees that basically creates a turf war for the State Universities Civil Service System (that's right SUCSS) to try to control employment vs the more modern Academic Professional employment system. Illinois is an \"Employment at Will\" state so why not ditch both SUCCS and Academic Professionals and hire and fire like real businesses? Getting a promotion or a raise is nearly impossible. The only way to accomplish this is to get another job offer.
