I didn't realize this fully until after I left the university. For a research university that inherently attracts naturally happy, creative, and mentoring professionals, it takes a lot of HR incompetence to create that kind of negative atmosphere. Here are some ways this was achieved in my department:\r\n\r\n1) The dean of my department at every year's all-staff meeting would give a speech emphasizing that employees will always come last in our mission. Customer service is first followed by university goals followed by (if possible) employee satisfaction. (Those to find themselves in a 'mentoring' or 'education' profession are typically not in it for the glory or the chance to come before the people they serve.)\r\n\r\n2) Upon completing the self-performance evaluation at every 6-month interval, I was routinely told by my supervisor to go back and change my responses and give myself lower ratings to better align with the overall average of the department. Not sure if this is just a really bad supervisor trying to sabotage my accomplishments and any hopes I'd have for a promotion or if it was really bad direction from HR given to a middle-management supervisor.\r\n\r\n3) Data isn't used when reviewing performance and when creating targets for future years. Flexible work schedules (for salaried employees who work all hours anyway) provided upon peer approval. One peer redirecting their dissatisfaction could prevent your request from for a flexible schedule, not only is it not granted but this feedback is then used against you in performance reviews. \r\n\r\nAlso -\r\nExpensive payroll deductions and benefits. Though it takes 15 minutes to walk from your parking spot to your office location, the costs for employee parking is in the ballpark of $500+ per year. The previous institution where I worked cost $25 for parking for the year, free for motorcycles, and the institution I attended for undergrad had free parking for all employees.\r\n\r\nNo p-cards. Employees who have to travel extensively for business trips have to pay for it with their own available credit and get reimbursed 3 weeks after all of their receipts are turned in. UR doesn't reimburse for interest charges or late fees, therefore it's like turning your employees into a personal credit card without paying them interest. Not sure if this is illegal but it should be."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "They keep growing, but offering less and less to employees", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "21 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Administrative in Rochester, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunities to move to another department or position.

It used to be free for employees, and after 10 years free for their kids as well.  That was  IF they could get accepted and met all kinds of criteria.   Then,  this changed to employees paying a percentage, and after 10 years their children would pay the same price as a SUNY school, with even more rules to get accepted.  I know at least a few employees that  worked here for many years,  made sure their child met all the rules and standards, only to discover their child was not accepted.   There was no reason other than it was a competitive year.  There is no recourse.  No other options.  It's a huge dangling carrot.   Other area colleges, like RIT, have much better tuition benefits.  After only 5 years, your child can go to RIT for FREE, without all the rules and criteria.  If your child does not want to go to RIT, there is a Tuition Exchange Program with hundreds of other colleges and RIT will pay 80% tuition at one of them for your child.  \r\n\r\nHealth benefits also fading.  Few plans to pick from, and more expensive, and covering less and less.   If you don't go to a U of R doctor, you are penalized and charged far more for everything, regardless of the type of plan you pick .  This was not the case a few years ago.  \r\n\r\nDepartments vary considerably, as far as how employees are treated and working conditions.  This can even greatly vary within departments, depending on the position.   Some departments have a large disconnect between faculty and staff.  \r\n\r\nRaises and pay are not that great - at least for staff.  For being the #1 employer in Rochester,  they seem to be getting more and more cheap with employees.  Expecting good workers to do the work of two people, or take a job for less pay than they are worth.
