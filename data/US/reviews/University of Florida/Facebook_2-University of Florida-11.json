Low pay. It's enough to live on in Gainesville, which is a super cheap, fun town (just don't live anywhere near campus) but it's not enough if you're worrying about student loans or literally anything other than rent, bills, food, and drinking your troubles away. Fees are getting higher and higher, and go towards things that contribute to undergraduate life, not your life, which is super frustrating. Health insurance is decent, but they'll inevitably screw up your coverage at the beginning of every new cycle so beware if there are prescriptions you rely on. UF is letting fantastic professors get nabbed by other universities, and at least within the humanities it seems like adjunct professors are doing the work that tenured professors should be doing, and PhD/MA teaching assistants are just really insanely underpaid adjunct professors."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture &

My particular college had a roster of former program directors who appointed spouses (and other family members) to administrative and faculty positions, where they performed so poorly that the college rotated them into non-teaching or non-administrative positions, all while paying them salaries in the $200K+ range for jobs where they neither taught courses nor performed any duties.\r\n\r\nBeing a faculty member here was like being aboard the Titanic after the last lifeboat departed. Eventually, you jump ship and take your chances that the university will bad-mouth you for leaving or even lie about you remaining here, as it did with four of my former colleagues who had left years earlier but were still on the faculty roster of their departments (a fact that surprised all of them).
