The work environment is toxic due to the supervisors favoritism. Supervisors give special privileges to their friends, this includes leaving early, clocking out no lunch, promotions, vacation, etc. If you're on their favorite list or work in outpatient you'll like the job and it can be very rewarding and interesting. However, if you work the ED you'll have to do your work and the other departments. You are expected to cover other departments, meaning you do your work and you do theirs. You also will have to cover other departments lunches, which leaves your department short staffed and not able to eat. I've worked multiple times and seen this, someone on a 12 hour shift will have to wait hours to eat because outpatient needs to be covered. If we try to clock out without a lunch (because we are never usually able to eat or take a full 30 minutes) you're threatened with occurrences and write ups, so we often we work 30 minutes for free. The ED is often short staffed and has to cover the other end of the hospital along with our own duties. You are left alone or work alone for hours at a time, often hungry and needing to use the bathroom. If their is a hole in the schedule you'll work alone. Your supervisor will not come in, will not help you, will not answer your call. We are discouraged and told to never reach out, call or text management with any issues. Working for Mount Carmel in general is bad, terrible benefits that are extremely expensive, raises are based on supervisors opinions and even with a good review are barely more then 10 cents, no room for growth unless you are a favorite. If there was an opportunity the supervisors in this department black ball you so you're DOA, no swag ever, no appreciation from the hospital or hazard / hero pay. HR will tell you to your face you signed up for this so you do not deserve anything. It's a cold and depressing place to work, everything is always broken, the computers are ancient as well as the programs, do yourself a favor and stay away.
