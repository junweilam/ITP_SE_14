Your role will likely change even before the ink on your first paycheck is dry.  Expect long working hours even when the rest of the college is a ghost town.

He was selected by trustees with money \u2013 the rich helping the rich get richer.  The new president will soon find that he made a poor career choice.  \r\nThere isn't enough meat on the bone to save The College from being buried by the competition and surviving past business decisions that allowed the sale of the original location of The College \u2013 it was beautiful!  They are now moving to King of Prussia and rely on tenants to afford the new location \u2013 one of the worst areas to commute in the greater Philadelphia area.  The new location is basically in the mall. The location strategy was based on saving money to keep the doors open \u2013 not convenient for students, faculty or staff.   \r\nEnrollment is down and they rely on large companies to fill their \u201ccattle shoot\u201d of students.  If one company decides to pull their student funding, this college will not survive the impact.  Alumni are mad and most will never come back - and for good reason.  The College is charging alumni to keep their hard earned designations active - WHAT?!!!  Does a traditional college remove your degree?!  This was another strategy to save the college from closing its doors - poor decision and it has proven to fail (yet they continue with this model).  I heard they are now going to try subscription based learning model - please stop \u2013 the hole that you dug is too large to fill as it is.  Alumni are not coming back, but their fundraising unit will continue to ask alumni for money for \u201cinitiatives\u201d.  In reality it helps to pay high \u201cexecutive\u201d salaries and keep the doors open just a little longer.  \r\nIn closing - it was the worst career move, but I am on my way back up the chain.  I left on my own and that was the best decision as there is no amount of money that would get me to go back to that place.
