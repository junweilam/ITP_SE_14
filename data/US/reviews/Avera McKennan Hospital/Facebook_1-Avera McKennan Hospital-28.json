I am actually Native American and had to endure hearing many derogatory terms used to describe Native Americans from peer Nurse Staff. Attempted three times to correct this behavior with manager and even the CEO. The requested investigation went nowhere. VERY WEAK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, large pay cut for nursing staff to make up for loss!!! Very \u201cclicky\u201d environment with preferential treatment to managers \u201cfriends.\u201d Was called into office for reprimand for issues such as (not bowing my head during Morning Prayer, using the bathroom off break time, not answering my personal phone on my day off and other minor or personal things). Issues are blown way out of proportion if you question management. Entire hospital seems to run off of an atmosphere of entitlement granted to individuals by religious preference or religious beliefs. \r\nHospital was fined very heavily for violation of employee breaks, it did not fix the situation. (You can actually look this up).  Be prepared to work a 12+ hour shift with only a partial break or sometimes even no breaks in a 12 hr day. If you do get a break be prepared for substandard, expensive (doctors and cops eat free) cafeteria food (even by industrial standards). Also be willing to accept several phone calls on your break (if you get one).\r\n Also you will find a huge turnover rate on many of the floors with brand new nurses filling critical positions. Too many new nurses and not enough retention of experienced nurses. I have worked for this hospital for many years and I have seen many good nurses \u201cwalked out (fired)\u201d from the place for minor challenges to management. \r\nIn closing, the hospital is too involved in off work personal life. Was actually told in a group meeting once not to post anything on social media that the Sisters of Presentation would disapprove of. Also constant on slot of, \u201cWhy do you only have one child, why don\u2019t you belong to a church, why didn\u2019t you get married in a church\u2026etc?\u201d In the long I felt like I was more in a cult rather than working in a hospital. Hard to get away from hospital, managers will fill your days off with meetings, education and other stuff which may put you in a mandatory overtime status (YOU CAN NEVER GET AWAY). It is not uncommon for nurses to have 300 plus hours of vacation time saved (not because you wanted to\u2026vacations are often denied and you may have to wait several weeks to find out if you get a vacation you put in for). Many former nurses will say they left because of \u201cnurse burnout.\u201d Injury rate is unacceptable (nurses are required to move patients, often with no assistance, night times are worse as no techs to help).  Very little done about certain doctors bullying nurse!!!!! Why work here???
