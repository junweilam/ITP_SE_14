I feel that upper management does not care about the people who are actually doing the Hands-On work with the clients and who know the clients better than anyone else. Also I was there for 6 years most of which was full time but I had to go part-time my last year there because I was pregnant and was restricted for work. I wasn't notified of this ahead of time but once I took my medical leave which was exactly 4 days before I had my son, I was told that because I was part-time they could not hold my position but that I could come back and apply afterwards as they had me as a good employee. However when I tried to go back and get a job they refused to hire me back. I did get unemployment during the time that I was out of work but I still feel like it was kind of shady the way that they didn't let me know ahead of time what would happen. Also the pay wasn't good. After 6 years of working there with no write ups I left there making less than a dollar more than what I started out as. It's not all about the money which is why I stayed as long as I did but still we worked hard. and I know that there are people there that are still working very hard and they should be compensated for their hard work."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "great opportunity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional in Belmont, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible schedules\r\nnice pay\r\nroom to grow\r\nsome caring & quality co-workers\r\namazing residents", "cons": "short staffed\r\nnot strict on bad staff"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Direct Service Worker", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Sept 2016", "job_title": " in Shreveport, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a good job", "cons": "Don't work around school schedule"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Direct Service worker", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Direct Service Worker in Doyline, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Their benefits are wonderful and love being able to help the kids.", "cons": "The paying scale is to low."}]]
