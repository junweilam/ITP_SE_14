Their union prevents experienced nurses from hopping from one unit to another while new hires get to bounce up within the same unit. The moral is low and it creates a negative working environment. Workplace bullying is very real and management does not take it seriously nor put a stop to it. Various units play favorites with nurses and qualified nurses are not able to move up in their departments. Poor work ethic on the floor. Bad parking. Required to maintain mandatory education for coorporate and professional upkeep, but not alotted time outside of work to complete said education, some of the modules are multiple hours long and staff is expected to complete on lunch breaks, when we get them during our 12 hour shifts, or during the hours we are to provide patient care. This is unreasonable as providing patient care is a nurse's priority, and retaining education with mulitple inturruptions  (to toilet people, clean them up, administer medications, chart, round with physicians, check cervix and fluid, etc.) is not reasonable. Staff on the whole has a total lack of respect for management. Sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Nurses are the escape goat for physicians. The bottol line is about the dollar and not the patients nor the employees. Looking for working equipment is a daily struggle that removes nurses from the bedside. There is a hospital merger between the two hospitals, they are combining them both into one building, and from the plans we have been shown, it will not accommodate our community's needs, but upper management has not listened to physicians and nurses regarding this. The merger is bringing a whole slew of problems: the combination of two nurse unions, maintaining seniority, a whole them vs us mentality.
