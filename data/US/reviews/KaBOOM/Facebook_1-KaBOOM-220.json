Having time to play with coworkers makes the relationships stronger, and I am happy this is something KaBOOM! encourages and supports. There are monthly events as part of an ongoing program for the organization, but many staff members put together additional events as well. Not only is there approval for this, but senior staff such as the CEO and CFO will show up to these events. When was the last time your CFO showed up to your desk dressed as Captain America? I can say a few months ago, personally.\r\n\r\nOur senior team is approachable. This doesn't mean they will always agree, or that things will always go in the direction you think they should... but it does mean they will listen to you, and they will respond.

All members of the senior team make well above $100,000, the majority making over $200,000, and 3 white men making over $300,000. Meanwhile, project managers and outreach staff are facing evictions and eating meals solely consisted of the peanut butter and jelly and cereal the organization provides because they can\u2019t afford anything else.  Staff has long been calling for a more equitable pay model and those calls are met with superficial solutions to pacify. One senior team member made $244,000, while no one on her team, even those more senior were making anything even close to being proximate. This same person wrecked havoc on the organization, causing complete turnover of her team and in others across the organization, including some of the best and brightest; and was rightly accused of racial prejudice and bias. The senior team was well aware of the issues, as well as experiencing them theirselves and failed to take action for several months, allowing her destructive behavior to continue for a year before she was let go. Additionally, the organization seems to care more about profit margins than their mission, but only those most senior see the benefits of that margin.

Among other initiatives, the organization is best known for spearheading the volunteer construction of approximately 200 playgrounds across North America every year. No matter your role in the organization, you contribute to the fact that, in any given year, the organization is responsible for building playgrounds that serve tens of thousands of children \u2013 that\u2019s pretty compelling. My experience from a salary standpoint was quite positive as it increased by more than 40 percent during my tenure (approximately five years). I received a raise every year I worked at KaBOOM! \u2013 even during the economic downtown. In fact, in 2008 or 2009 (I can\u2019t remember which year), the senior staff froze their salaries so that the rest of the staff could receive raises. I suspect that some employees received more compensation and others less over the years, but I viewed it as a reward for hard work (consistently 50+ hours per week and substantially more on occasion). Vacation time is accumulated fairly quickly and though there are incredibly busy times during the year, there are also slower times and it\u2019s not uncommon for people to take two straight weeks of vacation to travel abroad, etc. Depending on your position, you may have the opportunity to work closely with key decision makers at a host of Fortune 500 companies, which enables you to grow your network of contacts/colleagues. I\u2019m unsure of the current status, but during my tenure, the organization was extremely flexible toward a wide variety of working arrangements (working from home, allowing people to work from remote offices across the country when forced to relocate, etc.). The culture of the organization is infectious, even if you tend to be a bit reserved as I am. If/when you\u2019re able to view one of the playground builds, you\u2019re able to see first-hand how the culture tremendously affects the volunteers and organizations that benefit from those playgrounds.", "cons": "No organization is perfect and KaBOOM! certainly isn't an exception. As others have mentioned, in order to succeed at KaBOOM!, you must work hard \u2013 there are really very few exceptions. You are expected to work as long as necessary to perform your job functions \u2013 some people can accomplish that in 40 hours per week, but most work 50+ and some are more than 60+ on a regular basis. Staff turnover is a consistent issue and, in my view, is a driven by two key factors: burnout and employees brought on board who don\u2019t fit the overall culture particularly well. Though I was rewarded with substantial salary increases, the possibility for position advancement was limited in my department. It\u2019s admirable and born out of a desire to be on the cutting edge, but the organization tends to shift priorities on a regular basis (both conceptually and procedurally), which can have a negative effect on staff and morale (also a contributing factor to staff turnover)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Where to start?", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, really smart, genuine people, salary growth is great if you are at the Senior Manager level or above.

Mission is a great space of need with great potential for innovation.", "cons": "I agree with many of the others - serious case of founder's disease compounded with micro management of the senior team and frenzied or non existent management for those on the Outreach and Grants team makes for an extremely stressful work environment where people are largely unhappy. The management and communication of the strategy is poor - why hire so many smart, talented people if you can't trust them to execute and contribute? The implementation of the strategy is misguided and elitist, which can make it hard to connect with the work, let alone to convince others. There is no clear tactical direction with some of the directors having zero expertise in the field and no clue of how to execute, let alone manage others to do so. The ever increasing focus upon staffing and resources on social media and digital engagement as a means of achieving impact is ridiculous, as well as demoralizing for people who want to work at a non-profit, not a media agency. I will say some of the issues of KaBOOM! Have to do with unrealistic expectations and unproductive criticism... The organization does have an abundance of entry level positions - yes, when you are fresh out of college and you work in the nonprofit sector and it's your first job, you will get paid little and work lots. That's how it goes. It gets better, you have to earn your stripes. Don't like it, don't live in city like DC where the cost of living is unmanageable for someone not making a substantial salary. You can live out your DC dreams in a few years after you have some experience under your belt and can demand more money. The organization can sometimes hire for these entry level positions out of a pool of candidates that is overqualified and will naturally get frustrated easily. When there are so many talented, smart type As in one organization, there seems to be this drive for everyone to contribute to everything, while at the same time a sense of competition that causes some to seek individual praise/credit as opposed to collaborating with others to reach the best outcome - so many bottlenecks to delivering on the work. The CEO is definitely brash, and characterizations of him as a bully are not off base, however, in my experience, if you engage with him and debate/rebuttal instead of backing down, you can make traction. All of that being said - the senior team needs to get out of the way and let people co-create the strategy and execute without constant interference. If there are directors/managers who don't deliver despite seniority, let them go to make room for advancement for others, define goals that are realistic and easily communicated."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Meaningful mission-Great organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work done by KaBOOM! is top notch and this is due to the wonderful team of employees.
