To change the non-communication culture, we need to change different components simultaneously. For instance, company policy education is not espoused because our organization does not reinforce it or announce change. When a policy is amended, we should bracket and date the policy update or amendment sentence or paragraph, and email blast the change to every employee. When the change is read, the employee clicks an acknowledgement button, telling us they have read the policy change. Right now there is no systems in place. \r\n\r\nSecondly, supervisors/managers need to meet at least weekly with their subordinates and share important information that comes out of the leadership meeting.  The leadership meeting I believe is quarterly and should be monthly to share changes and events that are upcoming to our valued employees.\r\n\r\nSTREAMLINING THE ORGANIZATION: The organization is fractured and has no rhyme or reason for what it does. For instance lets take ADP and Health stream username. Why do we have 5 different usernames for different software when we should be using our EMPLOYEE NUMBERS.
