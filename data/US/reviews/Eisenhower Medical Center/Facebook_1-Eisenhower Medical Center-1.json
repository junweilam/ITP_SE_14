Hard work and hands-on experience will not get you ahead here; only a college degree of BA/BS and above. They hire those with degrees but NO experience and provide them with little training support, which makes for a very disorganized work setting and high turnover. This places the burden on the experienced staff to do a majority of the work for the same (or less) pay than their colleagues with degrees; I am sure you can imagine what kind of work environment this causes. I support continuing education but I also support equal pay for equal work. The learning curve is steep and the workload is unrealistic; I witnessed many colleagues burn out and quit. The \"open-door\" policy was a veil- people were afraid to ask questions or ask for help, and those who made mistakes faced punitive action. As for the patient population, they very much cater to the rich and it is sad to witness how they treat people with \"not-so-good\" or no insurance.
