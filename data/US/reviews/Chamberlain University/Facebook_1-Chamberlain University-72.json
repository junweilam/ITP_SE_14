After two major reorganizations, a reduction in force, the purchase of Walden, and some aggressive promises to stakeholders, it is now being run like the business that it is. Chamberlain/Adtalem is owned by shareholders who expect continually increasing profits - which is the norm for a publicly traded company - but a difficult feat to pull off for a University. Chamberlain currently maintains the absolute minimum of full-time people and working a 12-hour day six days a week is the culture and the expectation. Their former culture of care has morphed into taking advantage of people who care - and most people work themselves to the bone with the constant fear that students won't get clinical placement or have the support they need. This university is similar to hospitals these days- being short-staffed supports profits and they know you'll burn yourself out trying to care for each other and students. Recent changes include decisions to minimize resources for the campuses and focus mainly on hybrid and online offerings. This is leaving campuses languishing with a single leader spread over multiple campuses and associate or assistant dean positions let go, demoted, or spending their days begging visiting professors to take clinical groups and teach more courses. Students are feeling the crunch and some have experienced direct impacts. Chamberlain /Adtalem is dancing on the edge of revisiting the DeVry days. If you know, you know. Possibly worse is the backslide in diversity. During the layoffs, the diverse leaders, staff, and faculty were impacted. Of those who remained after many well-loved diverse leaders and colleagues left, a number have left in the second wave of the diversity drain. This reduction has damaged what was becoming an inclusive environment and left mostly non-diverse leaders and few people of color holding positions of limited control and influence (despite some of their titles).  Again- pay attention to who works for Adtalem versus who works for Chamberlain. You'll see that \"Adtalem\" prizes its 2022 award for being one of America's best employers for diverse workers (Forbes). Just keep in mind that's Adtalem- it's a holding company for five Universities including Chamberlain and employs its own people. Chamberlain University has its own culture and its own issues with diversity. The final blow is Chamberlain's recent requirement that all of its employees (including academics) sign a few different versions of what they are calling a restrictive covenant. The covenant puts barriers up if you are considering leaving, and among other things, gives Chamberlain the exclusive rights to all your scholarly work (even if done outside of Chamberlain), including any doctoral research. Taking over the rights to publications and research has potential lasting impacts on how and when authors can publish and ultimately limits their ability to freely make choices about how to disseminate their work. Potential new employees should consider how important maintaining control of their research or other publications might be - and if they're willing to try to negotiate an addendum as part of any employment agreement. All new employees will need to sign the restrictive covenant. My advice: 1) If you are a diverse person (in any aspect of diversity) you may want to wait to see if Chamberlain can regain its foothold in being a place to work that supports diversity 2) Consider reaching out on LinkedIn to someone NOT at the location you are considering. (That location might be desperate and try to sell you on coming on board). Talk to connections about the global Chamberlain strategy and culture, recent changes, and the level of support they currently experience 3) Look for and read student-moderated Facebook or other social media pages about Chamberlain - read about the realities the students are facing and think through how those realities might be traceable to business practices. 4) Don't sign the restrictive covenant until you have your attorney review it and you understand what it means for your future. Use any leverage you have (like how long they've been trying to fill a given position) to help you feel good about standing your ground and asking to negotiate the details of the covenant. If you take the job: 1) Set excellent boundaries around your work-life balance from day one and plan to work hard to hold them. 2) If you're diverse, engage with AdtalemEdge (a special interest group facilitated by Adtalem) to identify other diverse individuals who can help you navigate the culture and avoid potential pitfalls. 3) Try to identify someone with influence who can be your mentor/sponsor.  4) Consider that you may have to limit your time working at Chamberlain if you are not already adept at holding boundaries."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Number based", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Admissions Advisor in Addison, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a remote environment", "cons": "It is a number based job, if you don't get students to start you are letting down the whole team and thats when the micromanagement starts."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Student Finance Analyst in Addison, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You\u2019re fully remote and great PTO", "cons": "Management has no since of direction"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Overall good but like a call center", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Student Success Advisor in Addison, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team was great, awesome people, remote work.", "cons": "Call center type of work."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Opportunity", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work schedule offered and faculty support clinical professors", "cons": "Sometimes next contract assignments issued late in session may have to accept other work due to little time to plan."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Just Okay", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Student Services Advisor in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent work life balance.

Lastly, you will get a guaranteed base salary.", "cons": "Too many to list, but I have broken is down so a potential employee would know what to expect and how to behave to get the most of working there:  \r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is an extremely political environment, where you don't want be the person that questions anything, and DONT EVER QUESTION any ADA or D.A. big no no.  Instead, swallow your pride, and drink the \"Kool-Aid.\"  This will allow you to get promoted, get good raises/reviews, and just be on managements good side, at the very least it will allow you to keep your job and be a lifer there even if you are the worst at your job.  The \"admissions advisor\" role is a telemarketing/inside sales job that requires no skill to perform.  They can basically put anyone in there and soon enough they will be able to perform the job.  This is because the leads are given out by management, and there is no marketing or hunting that can be done on your part.  You have to work with what management give you, and they give the good leads to, you guessed it... the Kool-Aid drinkers.  There is a big discrepancy in leads.  The good leads for the most part are the ones that call in or apply through the chamberlain website, or inquire through google, etc.  After this, the other 98-99% of the leads are garbage that they waste there money on and are not interested, or even never inquired.  Also, the D.A.'s and A.D.A's are very lazy and have the most \"sit back, put your feet up\" type of job.  A lot of them would never make it even as admissions advisors today, but they were there when Chamberlain was just launching so basically got put into management by default or the newer ones by clout.  I want go into more detail, but there are a couple of A.D.A.'s who if you get transferred to there team, it most likely means you will get fired.  They are notorious for sending or trading people to these A.D.A.'s teams who they want to get rid off.  It seems like they still keep them A.D.A's for that reason.       \r\n\r\nSecondly, there is really no room for growth or to make any kind of big money.  The for-profit education industry has been under the radar from the government for a while, and its continuing to be scrutinized.  The fly by days for Chamberlain, Devry, and its counterparts are over.  Don't expect anything but to keep your job and keep working there for few years and getting a 0-3% raise yearly.  Management, will try to brainwash and dangle the carrot in front of you by telling you that you will get promoted and are on the fast track or in their special program to be in management.  Don't believe the BS, use your own knowledge to realize and understand where the industry and company is headed, and that's in the dumps.  Therefore, again just kiss ass and meet the required number to dials and talk hours you are suppose to get daily, and work there for a few years collecting a guaranteed base salary of about 40-45K and move on.  You will look very good to your next company because more and more hiring managers from other companies are realizing that this is a pretty hardcore sales job when you take away the smoke & mirrors and the \"front\" that they put on, and for you to be working here 2+ years looks good to another company for their sales role, which you might be able to earn a lot and make a career out of.  \r\n\r\nFinally, even if you are drinking the Kool-Aid realize at the end of the day you are still just another number just like the students.  No loyalty at all.  They will demote you without notice, or lay you off and/or fire you if you are making too much money and they need to cut salary.  They will also treat you like a potential student and keep asking you questions about your motivation, goals etc.  Just always say you want to be in management that's your goal.  Bottom line use them more than they use you and you will get the most out of this place."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It's all about the bottom line and not about people (AKA their \"colleagues\").", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Instructor in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not a whole lot of good here. \nIT can really make your life interesting. \nYou can buy MS Office for like $10.00", "cons": "Only care about NPS scores. \nDon't listen to their employees. \nMajor workplace bullying is the norm from management. \nManagement maintains a \"hit list\" for who they want to have removed. \nThey think their students are gold and platinum; their more like fools gold and coal."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Rapidly Declining Program", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous in Arlington, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They encourage flexible work schedules and there are truly passionate faculty and advisers that work for the company", "cons": "Faculty come in with no teaching experience and there is no onboarding or mentor program to help them with classroom management and teaching. Students suffer because professional nurses understand their specialty but not how to teach. \r\n\r\n Each department is always short staffed and senior leadership comes on campus from their national locations and do not push to change it nor support it. Budgets are often cut and students do not have basic college resources. When students voice their concerns it is often seen as complaining \r\n\r\n Admissions admits students that are academically challenged which is a nice thing because we are school that gives second chances but there are not the proper resources in place to support those type of students which is unfortunate. English as a second language is very common in addition to their being an older population. Both of which need additional academic support larger than the tutoring center ( which is also often shortstaffed)\r\n\r\n There are wonderful resources such as the simulation lab that are rarely used by students because they are rarely promoted. Students get very little hands on training which is odd considering they're being taught by nurses.

It is no different than working at a call center for your cable or cell phone company. Putting notes in the computer, taking a break, or using the restroom counts against you as part of your \"not ready\" time for taking calls. If this sounds like a sweatshop environment, it is.\r\n\r\nThe negative reviews on here are all accurate. The training gives you a fraction of what you need to know for the job. Everything you do at Chamberlain is micromanaged. Quality Assurance monitors the calls and then picks one every two or three weeks for evaluation, and they always find something wrong with the call. They have an ever-growing list of items you need to cover in every call with a student and the exact phrasing you need to use, even if this was covered with the student previously. Expect to talk to a lot of angry students in this job. QA also expects \"one call resolution,\" so shame on you if you forget to cover a point in their laundry list of items.\r\n\r\nThe managers will never help out if the phones get busy. One of the other reviewers is right in saying that managers seem to do nothing but run reports all day and find ways to yell at the employees. Division managers treat the employees like school children and will write up anyone who has a cell phone on their desk or who wasn't \"attentive enough\" at a meeting (the idea of making meetings more interesting never seems to cross the minds of management at Chamberlain).\r\n\r\nThe computer systems at Chamberlain are horrible. Many are outdated, and there are way too many programs to juggle overall. One or several systems will go down at least once a week. And once they do, you will have the joy of calling an outsourced Help Desk in the Philippines where they barely understand the systems you are using. \r\n\r\nThe overall environment at Chamberlain is negative. Managers are constantly thinking of ways to criticize the employees, and praise rarely is given. Very few employees have been working there longer than five years. If you have any criticisms of procedures, you'd better keep them to yourself, because they have a \"cult of positivity\" at Chamberlain which has infected so many corporate environments now. They constantly talk about where you are on the \"mood elevator\", and you'd better fake that you're doing ok or else risk getting tagged as a \"negative\" person. The truth is that most people there are feeling burned out a majority of the time. Management will also fire people on a moment's notice, and a lot of times, they will fire someone based strictly on what another backstabbing colleague has said. The ideal Chamberlain employee for management seems to be a twentysomething with retail experience who doesn't know that things could be run much better.\r\n\r\nThe starting salary is decent, but annual raises are typically in the 2% to 3% range. Advancing or even just changing departments is very difficult because of company bureaucracy and often seems to be based on favoritism. This is a major factor for why most colleagues don't stay with the company.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Chamberlain's parent company is Adtalem, which used to be called DeVry Education Group. They changed their name recently because of their bad reputation. A big reason for Adtalem/DeVry's bad reputation is the $100 million settlement they were forced to pay for deceptive advertising. \r\n\r\nThink twice before coming to work here. The place is a revolving door for a reason. Unless you enjoy working in a call center which pretends to be a school, a place where the management is constantly micromanaging and criticizing the employees, you can do better elsewhere. This is a for-profit school, and both you and the students are treated only as numbers. You are only as good as your last phone adherence report and QA evaluation."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Academic role", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Full Time Faculty in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diverse student population, faculty diverse too but becoming increasingly less.

I was once questioned why I was in the \"available status\" on my phone for 13 minutes. Yes, 13 minutes I was not on the phone or cold calling. When you work from home, they micromanage you more because working from home is something that is earned.  You are a machine that is micromanaged to an indescribable degree. You can actually feel the toxic energy in the building. The mangers are miserable and compete with each other constantly for students. Every call you have with a nurse is recorded and reviewed and taken apart piece by piece. The respect for the students is so minimal. They only care about the students starting and getting money. I have heard the most uncomfortable conversions in this career. Representatives are pushed to be persuasive to a point of manipulation. How about if a nurse doesn't want to earn their BSN we respect that decision and let them decide on their own time? This is a sales job that makes you compete with your coworkers and makes you feel like you are not trying enough when it is just luck.
