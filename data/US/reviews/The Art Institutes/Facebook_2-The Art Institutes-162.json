This all started with the pandemic when the Art Institutes consolidated the remaining of its campuses under one umbrella.\n\nMany students are so upset, that they come to class crying, it's heartbreaking... They changed the curricula and all of a sudden they need twice as many credits as they needed before in order to graduate. The school doesn't offer the classes they need to take, so full-time students are put in classes they don't need or classes they are not prepared to take, and we, the professors, have to deal with the mess.\n\nThey play with class availability and schedules until the last minute. Students can't organize their quarter because of these constant changes and many times they have to drop a class because the time or day changes and it conflicts with other classes they are taking. This also is an issue because when it happens, professors are not given enough time to prep. There is tons of miscommunication. If you are a professor you may see your assigned class with 16 students and on the first day of class, that number has duplicated.\n\nThe administration is a mess.

Back stabbing, degrading comments, and gender bias are common day practices.\r\n\r\nI feel so horrible that I was even part of this for the short period of time that I was. Though I never pressured any students and could sleep at night, I saw and witness many students who could not afford and had no business being at this school get pressured and conned into starting. Only to drop out weeks or months later. Horrible hours, working to late nights and weekends. Sen. Dir. of Adm puts himself first before employees and family.\r\n\r\nI think some of the people in the admissions department are very talented and have amazing upside. I sure hope they decide to move on to a better environment and company/school that values true students and education versus quotas for applications and enrollments.  \r\n\r\nI understand that needing students helps keep the school afloat, but not at the expense of 18-25yr old students lives that do not belong or afford a $100K Undergrad degree. \r\n\r\nIf you have no family, no kids, no integrity, and purely need a stop by job, then the admissions here is the place to be."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Decent pay, I really liked working there.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Teacher in North Hollywood, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I worked in the North Hollywood location and the building was nice and centrally located.

He was a micro manager and there were rumor going around that he threw his keyboard at someone for not producing. \r\n-The work environment was very much like a high school. \r\n- When I started, I was ready to leave! I was lucky enough to get out of this place. \r\n- They make you do these horrible \"interview\" with these famlies for 90 minutes just to sell them on the school and getting their application from them. \r\n- Overall, I do not recommend this place to anyone. There are better schools to work at. \r\n-There is also no such thing as work/life balance at all! So if you have small children, please stay away from this place."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Horrible micromanagement hell .... sinking ship stay away at all costs", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fairly good pay and good coworkers.

As an adjunct the number of classes you get varies, making it hard to depend on income.

Advancement is very difficult and I don't see the school leaning toward favorable measures for the future.\r\n\r\nAlso I get a lot of complaints from my students about the administrative side of the school. Sometimes they get charged more than they were promised and it leads to negative experiences. Several of my best students have left for this reason.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of students - the good ones made it a good experience.  The bad ones far outnumber them.  Most of them cannot be trusted or bothered to show up on time or do basic things like turn in assignments.  I don't believe these problems are exclusive to AI but the students are not really expected to be adults in any professional sense.  I had a number of students who would routinely outright fail or scrape by, but they were always enrolled in the next class.  I don't think the school does them any favors by just letting them come back no matter how poor of a student they are.\r\n\r\nThe attendance policy has changed in a terrible way and recently we were told we need to personally call every student who is absent every time they were absent as well as report our responses to senior management. In addition to this, we were told we need to serve at least one office hour every week unpaid. If I ever had a student show up for office hours, they would have been the first...this requirement was silly for adjuncts.\r\n\r\nDuring my final year at AI, everyone seemed to be just waiting for the next batch of bad news.  While I received moderate raises after my first two annual reviews, I received no raise for the third.  This was despite massive improvements in my evaluations from both my students and my superiors. To top it all off, once the new healthcare laws kicked in, they cut back the number of classes I could teach so that I wouldn't qualify for any benefits.  This turned what was possibly a decent adjunct position into a below average job.  \r\n\r\nOf course I looked for other work, and when I finally found a decent position outside of AI, I notified the president of my campus (because my boss was laid off in a string of cuts).  I gave my notice (3 weeks) and while I was doing extra course preparation for my classes, which started the next day, I discovered that my classes were no longer available from my end.  After conferring with another instructor, I discovered they gave away my classes to other instructors and didn't even tell me.\r\n\r\nHad I not been doing extra preparation, I would have shown up ready to teach only to find out I didn't have a job. I would have been better off if I didn't give them a notice at all - they only used it against me.\r\n\r\nA lot of people are either jumping ship or getting laid off.

When you realize the money is not worth it, you either get stuck there because you literally have no time spend time with your significant other let alone find a new job or you wasted time there. \r\nWhen these reviews say, the management is unethical etc., that's an understatement. It's truly a glorified telemarketing job in a sweat shop and your selling a 100,000.00$ education to a student who cant even write a 150 word essay to be accepted! But do not fear because management will re-write it or have you do it, to force more student's in the door!!!! Stay away!!! I feel bad for my friends that are still stuck there! Oh yeah and that bullS*** about 6% raises annually. LOL...BULLS***!!! They laid of half of the academic staff, financial aid, registrar, translator's and so on. So just when you thought you were signing up for a sales or customer service position, you have became an admissions rep, a financial officer, a registrar (you have to literally register the student's) NEED I GO ON? This is coming form someone who over sat every class, exceeded every goal and worked there for a few years. I won't even continue to tell you about politics there, it will only make me throw-up.

They also micromanage to an unbearable point, send threatening emails, make you fear you could lose your job, constantly changing forms or procedures, etc. Then they try to blame the negativity and low morale on the employees instead of looking at themselves or finding a way to correct it. Also, they speak very demeaning to employees and practically treat us like children at times. They truly do not listen to employees concerns or suggestions. They use aggressive bullying tactics to try to get certain people to quit or eventually fire them and it works. I've seen roughly 30+ people leave or get fired in the year so there's the high turnover. Also, they have changed the scheduling around so that is NOT condusive to family life.
