There is a \"good old boy\" mentality with male faculty particularly in the sciences and environmental studies. I was bullied by a tenured male faculty member and when I tried to address my concern with his supervisor (also a tenured male faculty) he responded, \"that's just the way he is\". No actions were taken. A pretty toxic work environment for female faculty. There is also lots of favoritism where family members of faculty are often hired over more qualified candidates. If you are not a white male who skis and has money I suggest not considering working here. This university has so much potential but is mostly run by privileged ski bums who don't really want to provide an inclusive and welcoming environment for people who are not like them and have very little experience or vision on how to run a susccesful university."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bad Pay Bad Leadership Bad Culture", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Professor in Gunnison, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Ski area nearby and mountain biking in Summer", "cons": "The leadership from Chairs is really poor.

I was told by HR, \"He's an institution.\" Immediately felt worried for the students he has authority over, as he is a faculty member. \r\n\r\nSecond strike: on the face, are always encouraging diversity, equity, and inclusion. On the other side, consistently cull non-native English speaking faculty and show complete disregard for safety. At one point, the entire black student cohort in basketball left, en masse, because white students were so hostile. In a Board of Trustees meeting, when asked to say \"Black Lives Matter,\" one pulled an all lives matter, one said he was for it but didn't agree with the organization, one said he was surprised that the public wanted them to align with a \"political group.\" A Board member also asked the faculty trustee what institutionalized racism was. \r\n\r\nThird strike: May 26th, furloughed 39 support staff who had no one to speak for them at either the faculty meeting or the Board of Trustees meeting that made the decision. Were told 6 days before the start date of June 1st that they would not be needed for the next 1/2-2 months. The total savings were $70,000. The President makes over $300k a year (and his housing is included). \r\n\r\nThey completely disrupted 39 people's income for up to 2 months, for what amounts to a rounding error in their annual budget (worst case is $3 mil, so 2%). Meanwhile, admin patted themselves on the back for their 10% salary cuts. BoT also considered it a favor, as they selected the people who are paid the least, meaning they should (hypothetically) get paid more on unemployment with the $600 temporary Covid bonus.\r\n\r\nProblem is, it can take 2 months to hear back about your application, if you can get one in between the other millions applying. It also doesn't pay out fully if you haven't worked at the same place for over 18 months. Since we are paid once a month, they won't see a full paycheck until August 31st (or September 30th, if you are out for 2 months). \r\n\r\nFourth strike: Pay. Horrific in general, especially considering cost of living in the area. Searching for apartments reveals average rent is $1500. You can find a rathole for less, or split with someone else who can't afford to live on what they pay here. Or, get another job, as several staff and faculty do.
