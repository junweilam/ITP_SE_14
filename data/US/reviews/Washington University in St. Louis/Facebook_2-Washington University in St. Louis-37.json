"duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can have a stable research staff job if you are in a well-funded field University-wide benefits are great", "cons": "I work in a research staff position that works closely with colleagues in identical jobs in Wash U Neurology and Psychiatry. It's an open secret among staff and among faculty in Radiology, Neurology, and Psychiatry who are writing grants that Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology/MIR pays less than comparable staff positions in other departments. In many cases I've seen, a LOT less. I've talked with multiple junior faculty members who are making anywhere from $10-30k less than people at their same levels in Psychiatry and Neurology. These are high-performing new faculty members in Radiology, in many cases POC and/or women, who are collaborating closely with, performing identically to or better than, and in a lot of cases winning actual identical grants to their colleagues in Neurology and Psychiatry. These people are bringing in a TON of grant money for MIR and MIR refuses to pay them what other departments say they're worth. It's wild. In my own case and in the case of other staff colleagues at my level, research staff in Radiology are making $10-20k less than those with identical duties in Psychiatry and Neurology. In a few instances I've helped to train people in collaborator groups in roles just like mine who are making more than me as a baseline. It's frustrating. I'm aware of a Radiology colleague who was given a promotion and received new promotion-based duties 6 months before their salary was actually increased - and their request for back pay was denied. Trying to advocate for yourself or your team to MIR leadership sends you through a labyrinth of impossible challenges to justify exactly what the cause for change is (\"pay equity with people who do the same thing I do\" is not a good enough response for them) so ultimately nothing changes. Turnover at MIR is fairly constant for reasons like this, which means we are constantly training new people in our own department and spinning our wheels. MIR leadership is entirely uninterested in working for pay equity at any level and shuts it down right away if you broach the topic- they very much want to hide this information, but as I mentioned it's pretty common knowledge among staff and new faculty in various departments that they pay a lot less and are generally less flexible on things like promotions and remote work arrangements (MIR won't budge on this even if you are dealing with health issues or caregiving duties - I know someone great who is going to have to leave their MIR job over this, it's heartbreaking and I dearly hope they can transfer to Neurology). There's an upcoming window where they might make changes when a new chair of Radiology is chosen, but from my discussions with faculty the general feeling is that it's unlikely that any material changes will happen, and if so it would be incremental pay adjustments for faculty with no updates at the staff level. We'd all be very surprised if MIR goes for actual pay equity with other departments for either faculty or staff. If you are looking for a research staff job at Wash U and you have skills and experience to offer, try to avoid Radiology if you can. Turnover is fairly constant and they have repeatedly demonstrated aren't interested in making any changes, pay-based or otherwise, to encourage faculty/staff retention. If you are trying to get your foot in the door, it's fine, that's what a lot of us are doing here, just make sure you stay aware of your worth while you are here and leave when you have the experience to get a better deal."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management eh, pay eh, awesome coworkers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoy the community of diverse individuals, coworkers always bring new ideas to the table and try their best to work as a team", "cons": "Management doesn\u2019t listen to people that are desperate for help until they lose workers\u2026.

However the whole academic system for PhD students just feels dirty. It feels a lot like a pyramid scheme. PhD students are severely underpaid for their skill level because of the 'education' and degree that they receive, but in most other ways are treated like an employee. What makes it feel dirty is that, the position that PhD's are trained for (Professorships in Academia) are only obtained by roughly 15% of the graduates. While PhD typically are able to transfer their skills to another area this problem is often downplayed, but that doesn't  change the fact that transitions away from Academia are not easy to pull off and there is not sufficient 'training' and support from the university to help students in this process. So the University gets a severe discount in labor costs because of this system and on the back end says to the students \"Thanks for all the hard work suckers! Good luck figuring out on your own how to make a living off of the skills we taught you.\" \r\n\r\nGranted this problem is not limited only to WashU but all of Academia, so to be fair, relative to other universities WashU does extraordinarily well."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "University taking advantage of PhD student labor", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 May 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Teaching Assistant in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The good parts of being a graduate teaching assistant (as a PhD student) at Wash U included working with the undergraduate students and having (some) time to do my own research and writing.

The department was short staffed but new hires were not coming through the door as a result of a long and burdensome process with HR to list new openings so we had to give up our personal lives to keep the department afloat.  My salary was the lowest I have ever earned in my field which I initially had accepted, as I had heard great things about this university-- which I found to be untrue.  I found other employment and moved on peacefully after a year of little sleep and no personal life.  Years later I discovered from my current job (completely across the country) that the manager at Washington University St. Louis had placed many horrible lies on my HR record upon my departure such as \"Employee cursed out the manager\" and \"Employee was terminated\".  Working their employees to death pushed us out the door, then to top it off they took out their frustrations of being short staffed due to their poor management on the former employees who did nothing but work day and night 7 days a week to keep a department running.  I am exhausted just thinking about sitting at work for a solid 3 full days with no sleep during an upgrade and I was told that I could not leave, by management who went home for 18+ hours each day during this upgrade.
