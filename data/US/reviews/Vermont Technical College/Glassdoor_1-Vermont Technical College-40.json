When I actually walked in for the first time and heard how many employees there were, I was shocked because it was so quiet. I never had an issue with management and they always treated me with respect and reviewed my work without bias. The only negative thing they ever said to me in a review of my work was when they politely asked me to tidy my desk (which was warranted).\n\nAlthough the training is extensive, it's understandably necessary once you start your work (I worked as an evaluator). You get to learn the education systems of multiple foreign countries as well as other protocols (verifying official documents, learning degree equivalencies, etc.) One thing that greatly appealed to me about the office is how much is done independently. Once you have your training, you're given files and sit quietly at your desk in your own space- something that would definitely appeal to someone who prefers to work alone rather than in a group. At the same time, all of the evaluators (as well as support team) are very personable and willing to help as you'll quickly learn that no file/application is ever the same, so it may occasionally take more than two evaluators to come to a conclusion regarding an applicant's studies. However, you're never put down for asking questions (I asked many) and if anything encouraged to do so to ensure no details go by unseen. \n\nI feel very lucky that I got the chance to work for IERF as now I'll be able to hold onto my training and will have this information for the rest of my career. Although education credentials is not something I ever believed I would get into (or even really knew existed), it is quite valuable information that I can now apply to multiple positions at colleges and universities.", "cons": "For the record, every office has its pros and cons. One thing I would caution future employees here is that, as an evaluator for foreign education credentials, policies and stipulations for every country change on a daily basis. You may be just getting used to a policy for a specific institution or country, and before you know it, some Ministry of Education will change their requirements which in turn changes the companies. Of course these things happen at many companies, but it is seen more frequently in an environment dealing with practically every single country."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Terrible Company!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jan 2020", "job_title": " in Culver City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There really isn\u2019t any substantial pros to be honest.", "cons": "I wouldn\u2019t recommend working with this company.
