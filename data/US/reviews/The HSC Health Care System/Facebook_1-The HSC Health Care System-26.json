Be careful about complaining to HR because they don't work for the employees - they work for management. I saw many colleagues go to HR with legitimate concerns and they were basically told to stop crying about it. Retaliation from managers goes completely unchecked. It's unfortunate because the staff at HSC are really fantastic. The outpatient therapy staff work hard and are highly skilled. If you are motivated and bright therapist, looking to develop your skills as an SLP, OT, PT, or in the field of Psychology - DO NOT WORK HERE.
