Many times they leave one BHT to over 20+ patients. You will be completely overworked with way too many patients than is safe, but if anything happens, you will be blamed. Don\u2019t expect the RN\u2019s to help because they definitely won\u2019t. They don\u2019t cover boards or rounds. Don\u2019t expect to take your breaks or lunch either. You\u2019re so overworked that it\u2019s almost impossible to have time to or find someone to relieve you. Not to mention you only get a 30 min lunch for a 12 hour shift. You\u2019re supposed to get two 15 min breaks in addition, but they won\u2019t happen. They do not care about you whatsoever. \r\nRun poorly by management. Staff, management, CEO, BHT\u2019s are always quitting. Staff is always frustrated. \r\nTerrible communication.\r\nShort-staffed all the time. If you really want to work here, keep your head down, show up, shut up, and don\u2019t complain about a thing.

You will get ignored and overlooked. If you communicate any issues to management, they will tell you that you have a bad attitude, or don\u2019t like how you\u2019re acting, are unprofessional, or straight up ignore you. \r\nThey don\u2019t always honor bonuses for you picking up shifts. You have to keep all record of text messages or contact with managers otherwise they will screw you over. Scheduling is a game you have to learn how to play. They\u2019ll make you switch shifts to accommodate their staffing with the threat to cancel on your scheduled days. If you just let them cancel you, then pick up the shift on the day they need, you\u2019ll get the bonus. But if you switch, they will not. Some people go from Full-Time to PRN just to pick up their own shifts with bonuses and make more money. Expect to be treated poorly by management and your co-workers.
