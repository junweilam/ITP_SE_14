I felt more like an enrollment manager than a student services advisor when I was there. The truth is, students won't graduate on time if they don't take 2 courses per summer semester, but summer courses are all out of pocket for students. Additionally, students who are no longer eligible for Financial Aid because they've failed their courses are pushed to keep enrolling and paying for these courses out-of-pocket even though they'll probably fail again, all to meet goals (pretty shady business practice, right?).\r\n-Additionally, there's a lot of pushback from management when students drop summer classes. Advisors are often asked to call students and to push them to enroll, even when students give them pretty good reasons for dropping courses. Instead of training advisors in advising techniques to build plans for students that work for them, they're mostly asked to use sales tactics to get students to enroll.\r\n-The institution does not feel like a 'student first' organization, but rather an enrollment/money-making institution. Some students come in with zero art background and limited resources to succeed. The organization attempts to explain itself by saying that it's trying to be accessible to anyone who wants to be in the arts. It seems great, but with so many online students, it's almost impossible for them to connect with their resources.\r\n-Another shady practice: students are only able to transfer credits coming in. If they ever leave and return, they're not able to transfer any more of their credits, even if they're basic college classes and not art classes.\r\n-Ethics aside, the work environment is not that welcoming. It often doesn't feel like a team, and there's no real human feeling to the workplace, such as team lunches. It's mostly, \"Here are lists of students you need to call by this time.\"\r\n-The environment is very much a telemarketing one. There's no real privacy, even when meeting with students, and you're unable to make a connection with your students. \r\n-Definitely no professional development and mentorship.\r\n-Extremely inflexible work schedule. There was no budging to the 9-6 schedule, unless MAYBE you've been there for a while, regardless of your commute. They put business needs over employee needs without hesitation.\r\n-Not to mention that you're not able to use benefits until your trial period is over, which is about 90 days in, and your 401K isn't guaranteed, and you're not eligible for it unless you've been there for a year.\r\n-I eventually left because I got another job closer to where I lived, and I was sad to leave some of my students behind.

Upper management fostered a fear-based culture as the best way to keep employees in line -- you never knew when someone might get in trouble, and what minor issue might be blown up out of proportion to trigger it. Those that lasted the longest in their positions were those who kept their heads down and did their best to go unnoticed.  If an employee excelled -- it was unlikely to be recognized. However, on the flip side, new and changing policies were not communicated to staff clearly or effectively; sometimes, they seemed to be created on a whim by upper management.  Thus, several employees received 'verbal warnings' and 'write-ups' for minor infractions. Oftentimes, these were in situations for which the employee, and his/her supervisor, had no idea any 'policy' was being violated (!). \r\n\r\nIn any given deadline cycle, most of the production staff  (both content editors and instructional designers) were often juggling unsustainable workloads. New, ill-conceived policies and procedures were often implemented; these involved the generation of excessive busy work. Several times, these policies were delivered close to a deadline, forcing everyone to adapt at the last minute, while already dealing with a heavy load. When the production staff would communicate these concerns again & again to upper and middle managers, the response was acknowledged but not addressed.\r\n\r\nConstructive criticism to improve the work environment was discouraged and could incur the ire of management; so it was better to keep your mouth shut. This was unfortunate, since a) it discouraged top performers on the production side to excel, and b) discouraged innovators to improve the tools and systems used to execute their jobs. My peers and I regularly overheard upper management boasting to others about their successes -- with, usually, no recognition of those employees who ensured their perceived successes. \r\n\r\nThere is no clearly defined pathway for career advancement, nor is there any rewards system in place for top performers at the ground level. The performance review process is opaque, at best. Staff undergoing reviews aren't typically invited to participate by summarizing their achievements or giving feedback.

If you are intelligent and outspoken they will make sure they find an excuse to get rid of you. They don\u2019t like feedback!!  They fire people left and right without any warnings.\r\nFor the most part, this is a transitional job for everyone; they either hire people fresh out of college so they don't know any better how real professional jobs are supposed to be, or people without college degree!! That\u2019s right they hire people without college degrees to advise students about getting higher education and go to college, WHAT A JOKE!! More like a car salesmen job. Forget about promotions or trying to move up, It is SOLELY based on favoritism.

Our computer activity and number of phone calls are constantly monitored. Some staff are fired for being late 8 times while others are late 20 times without losing their jobs. Some staff are denied the chance to interview while others don't even have to interview to get promoted. Some of us work hard to get the perfect \"PCG\" score towards our raise, only to find out at the end of our year that this is no longer valid and that we'll be graded on new, undetermined standards. No business will ever be perfect, but these clear examples show that in Admissions, even the most basic of business practices can't be run properly. Staff turnover is high and we recently had 11 supervisors/managers/directors across several key departments quit within a 2 month span, leaving only a couple leaders to manage the shrinking department. It is not normal to have all of your leaders leave at once, and illustrates that the upper management of AAU does not know how to retain.\r\n\r\nThe minimal benefits provided to us were removed this year- 401k matching was cancelled due to the school's failing performance and we didn't even get a day off to observe July 4th.

They pressure the employees to make the numbers: 3 Applications per week, 2 Registrations per week. If one does not meet these expectation for lack of good prospects, they pull you in to the office for formal coaching on performance. They are constantly telling the employees what they need of them, but spend little to no time on giving them the resourses to succeed, such as training, role plays, on the spot feedback, team selling, etc. They don't even monitor calls anymore for quality assurance and training purposes, which was annoying, but was pretty effective. The department does not provide employees with a policies and proceedures guide or a standard yearly review, so one never receives a formal appraisal nor the chance to receive a raise. It is diminishing and depressing to work for the Admissions Management. They will never acknowledge ones hard work through recognition nor promotions. My manager gets late to the office everyday without even saying good morning, and stays in his office without interacing with his team, unless it is to give you a message or to coach you on your below average numbers on a given week.
