Management runs the place like a high school with the special people and the ones who get bullied. Everyone is gossiping about each other, especially management about other employees. They told customers my dad had passed away over email. HIPPA? \r\n\r\n They SAY they follow the Leaders Eat Last book but that is just to disguise how they bully people out of jobs so they don\u2019t have to fire them and make work flow impossible. \r\n\r\nI would constantly show up early and work through my lunch to meet a deadline and then get abraded for being 10min late. \r\nThey don\u2019t give you tools, a desk, training, or the software to do your job, then treat you like you are a child for asking for things that any real company knows to provide their employees. They even lie about equipment being set up when it\u2019s not.\r\n\r\nI developed an ulcer from constantly being treated as though I couldn\u2019t do anything right, being run around in circles and management using me as a scapegoat for their failures. When I couldn\u2019t get out of bet from the stress of it all I was let go. \r\n\r\nA day after being let go, still sick they called the police because I had an iPad I was wiping because it had my Apple ID on it and no one else could do it. They also made every excuse not to give me my vacation pay and cheeped me out of the medical stipend when I still had to pay for medical even though it would end. \r\n\r\nThese people claim to be Godly but I don\u2019t know how they can sleep at night with all the things they\u2019ve done to other employees as well."}]]
