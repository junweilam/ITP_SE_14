Requests to upgrade university tech equipment are only approved once they become an emergency. IT's management has to fight university management tooth and nail to get even minor improvements, and that's only if IT has management who's interested in improving the department.\r\n\r\nIT staff themselves are also resistant to change, but this is probably because they're each doing the jobs of several people. The department has been hemorrhaging employees for at least 6 years and almost no replacements are being hired.\r\n\r\nSome of the staff (fewer than there used to be, thankfully) seem to despise students, others are totally disinterested in the job satisfaction of their employees (both staff and student employees). The helpdesk is run with complete incompetence and has become a joke, providing no value to the student employees who work there, despite the student employment job being advertised as a potential internship experience. The higher-ups to the helpdesk student employees are discriminatory and utterly disinterested in attempts to improve the department or the experiences of the student employees. Minor problems are met with scolding and punishment, black male employees undeservedly taking the brunt of it. Attempts to improve the office work environment are shot down, or run into the ground before they can make progress. Student employees are expected to take on significant duties meant for staff with little, if any, increase in pay.\r\n\r\nPromotions and raises are rarely offered, and university management fights them whenever a supervisor wants to give one . University management considers yearly increases in minimum wage to be a raise, and puts a limit of one raise per year, so it can deny any other requests for promotions/raises.
