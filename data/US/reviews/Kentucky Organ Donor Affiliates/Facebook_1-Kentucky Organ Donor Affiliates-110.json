In other words, Donor Center Coordinators were very busy and productive but we did not have the recovery team resources to successfully recover from all these donors. This was a source of repeated frustration for Donor Center Coordinators. The organization was in dire need of expanding its tissue recovery staff roster so that two tissue recovery teams could be available every shift. \r\n4) The organ teams had a bad habit of stealing tissue team staff to help with organ recoveries. This resulted in shifts where the tissue team on-call was totally unavailable. This is where a second on-call tissue team would be a major help in preserving Donor Center productivity and limiting the number of consented donations that we had to forgo simply due to staffing issues."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Dedicated and Compassionate People doing Life-changing work everyday", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Vice President in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "KODA is full of passionate, smart, fun individuals committed to this lifesaving mission.
