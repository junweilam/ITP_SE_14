ABC is a growing family that cares about its employees, both personally and professionally. \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t imagine working anywhere else, and I have personally referred many people who are now also working for ABC that feel the same way. Many of us have been with the company for over a decade because we recognize a great place to work, and we share the same passion for helping people and animals. I am a firm believer that if you enjoy what you do for a living, it doesn\u2019t feel like work. Luckily for us, the owner is smart and made sure that we always had an emergency plan. While we never expected to have to use it, he made sure that if something were to happen (a fire or an earthquake is what we were worried about) that ABC employees would still have a job, and we would be able to conduct business at either an alternate location or from home. \r\n\r\nNo one could have predicted Covid, but luckily, we were more prepared than most companies and had everyone working from home with minimal downtime (most experienced no downtime). ABC was able to keep everyone working, which has been a blessing for us all.

With the choice to stay remote, I believe employees will be given additional time to provide themselves with proper set ups. Being an Admissions Counselor, commission is given per student enrollment.", "cons": "Upper management are known to condescend and publicly shame employees, including talking poorly of specific employees with office doors open and extremely audible. HR fraternizes with certain upper management so complaints against them are never taken seriously, and anything you say is immediately repeated to whomever the complaint was about. Unless, of course, you file a complaint about someone that HR doesn\u2019t like, then your case may get some action. Externship Coordinators, Program Managers, and Qualifiers are paid pennies in comparison to upper management. \u201cBonuses\u201d, if you can call them that, are only given to five employees at a time (awards done each month) and they\u2019re usually either $100 (for two employees) and the rest get $25 for the Program Operations Department. But it\u2019s entirely based on numbers, which is difficult for all departments to maintain considering the vast differences between the expectations of student in each and the job descriptions of each employee. ABC expects their mentors to work for free, unless it\u2019s the Dog Obedience Program. Admissions Counselors are allowed and encouraged to be dishonest to students to enroll them, even so far as to enroll student with significant intellectual or physical disabilities that ultimately prohibit them from completing the program once they get to Externship, which doesn\u2019t matter because they sign their right away to a refund if they reach that stage. So ABC still gets its money. ABC overworks their staff and expects perfect performance, while offering little to no support. We are expected to answer questions about legalities, disabilities, and insurance concerns with no assistance or knowledge of what ABC is actually covering and how we can assist student and mentors. The CEO is so out of touch with his employees, he genuinely doesn\u2019t understand how his own programs operate or what we even do when we\u2019re working. He puts priority in to uninteresting and unsuccessful programs while the others flounder, to see which he can make a quick buck off of. Rather than supplying additional support for his current staff so that we can provide a much better experience for existing programs, he creates programs that no one wants and hires more staff at awful pay and leaves other staff to fend for themselves. If you apply for a position, whether you already work for the company or not, but you don\u2019t get the job they will just ghost you rather than informing you that you aren\u2019t getting the job. Which isn\u2019t required, but it\u2019s basic decency. Which ABC seriously lacks. The company also encourages employees to write good reviews on Glassdoor and other sites, sometimes even offering pay as an incentive, to keep their scores up. Even going so far as to recommend things to say or have upper management write it themselves. Upper management lacks compassion for employees and they often retaliate in subtle ways to make employees uncomfortable, further preventing employees from speaking out and voicing concerns. Answering phone calls from angry students and parents and not being able to transfer them easily or reach out to management for assistance is exhausting. The turn around for the company is astronomically fast. Ultimately, if you value your sanity, choose another company, because you\u2019ll constantly feel responsible for other people\u2019s words and actions, leaving you drained at the end of every work day. On top of it, ABC boasts having the ability for employees to advance within the company, but rarely make positions known to employees who are eligible. While the remote life is nice, the overall work environment is not worth it. Prepare to be ignored, undervalued, and neglected by your superiors, unless you\u2019ve somehow managed to get their negative attention in which they will hyper-fixate on impossible standards."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Company tries to maintain employee morale", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in Valencia, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Full Benefits\n401K\nFamily-Oriented\nWell known college in the animal education industry (Dog Trainer, Groomer, Vet Assistant, Etc.)\n8 am - 5 pm M-F (regular work hours)", "cons": "Micro-managed environment\nLittle opportunity to interact with co-workers throughout the day\nRecord calls, listen back and critique sales \nInflux of sales reports distributed \nMore interest in a sale than in education"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Animal Behavior College is not just a school, it's a family!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Customer Service Specialist in Santa Clarita, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "After working for Animal Behavior College for almost 8 years, I can honestly say that this has been the best job/career that I have ever had!
