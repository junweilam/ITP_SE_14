If you're not a nurse, you're treated like you're on the bottom rung. Essential workers (i.e. custodians and point of care technicians) are treated like they aren't even human. A lot of this stems from the fact that everyone gets equal pay-- while this sounds great in theory, it doesn't mean that everyone thinks everyone else is on equal footing. It means that people who are \"skilled\" think they deserve better than those who do grunt work. This place is bleeding money to the point where they can't even afford overtime, and it's no wonder why; they must have to pay through the nose to settle constant patient rights lawsuits. While I can't go into it here because of HIPAA concerns, I have seen horrific things done to patients in this hospital, to the point where I'm wondering if I'm in 2023 or 1923. Diversity is non-existent; I literally have not seen a single non-white person working here. I would not recommend this business to any minorities, racial, sexual, gender-diverse, neuro-diverse, or otherwise. All of the higher-ups, and most of the staff, are VERY socially conservative."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Sharing", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Patient Access Representative in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They care about their employees", "cons": "The job is very tiring"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good for medical surgical care", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small town hospital feel for patients.", "cons": "Upper Management makes changes not desirable to staff."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Terrible Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Mar 2023", "job_title": "IT Support in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive team mates that are willing to help you.", "cons": "Heavy meeting culture (waste of time ) Heavy micromanaged management style Very High TURNOVER"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Hard work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Environmental Services Technician in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Insurance and dental insurance were good.", "cons": "Not appreciated for all the hard work."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Accountant Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Staff Accountant in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Laid Back Environment, Co-Workers are friendly", "cons": "Turnover, Deadlines can be tough"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "An okay employer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Point of Care Technician in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "12 hours shifts, and they worked around schedule.", "cons": "The management was a disaster, and the higher ups didn't help."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Excellent co-workers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Physical Therapist Assistant in Norwalk, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very friendly co-workers and healthy work environment.
