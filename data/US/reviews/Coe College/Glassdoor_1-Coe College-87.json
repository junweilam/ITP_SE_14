I worked on the Student Development/Student Life team and loved my coworkers, the students I worked with, and the general campus community.

The leader of our department left and leadership was given to the higher ups below the President. Our former president retired and the vacuum left allowed certain leadership to assume more power and run a bulldozer through campus. Student Life was told our leadership was being reconsidered to better benefit our team and our students...instead, they used the guise of \"institutional effectiveness\" as an excuse to absorb part of Student Life duties and push out dedicated/talented staff, or change/eliminate our jobs completely, and then pretended like that wasn't what was happening. This happened in multiple departments before ours.\r\n\r\nIt may be better now that things have may be settled, but just know that leadership does not care about you as an individual/someone with unique talents and passions. They will do whatever they want to save money/enroll more students.\r\n\r\nAlmost no opportunities for promotion/advancement - too small of a campus/not enough jobs.\r\n\r\nAlso, pay is very low. You really have to love your job/not need to make money for your family to justify it.
