Due to the way the nurses are treated and overworked (mandatory overtime) they easily get irritated and develop poor attitudes. This gets transferred to some patients, other units and other departments (lab, pt, etc).  Nurses still have to put in orders for the physicians due to a complicated charting system and the hospital is frequently at maximum capacity for patients. They force the ED to hold patients while still accepting transfers from other hospitals. The higher ups don't seem to care about overworking their staff, they just seem to care about getting as much money as possible. Since the nursing school (on hospital campus) pumps out new nurses twice a year, management can pay those nurses less and fill the positions they have open (for the time being). They do not care about trying to keep knowledgeable staffing. The people who have been there for many years and are invested in their retirement package are \"topped out\" on pay (no one makes over 45/hr base) so they can't leave but don't get offered any increase in pay for years of investment in the place (they will tell you this is because they offer a year end bonus which adds up to nothing after taxes). The \"newbies\" realize that this is a good stepping stone to get experience and move on to better, higher paying jobs so they don't stay for more than a few years if they can. When patients complain about the nursing staff they get \"compensation\" for not being satisfied with their stay (even if nursing staff tried their best to please the patient but the patient was down right nasty)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It's ok.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "7 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Information Technology in Bowling Green, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Once your in, don't expect to ever loose your job for any reason. \r\nHealth benefits are pretty good.\r\nYearly Vacation builds up over time.", "cons": "People who screw up and never do their job are never let go, just moved to a different department. \r\nUpper management do not listen to their knowledgeable employees. \r\nUpper management over react to everything no matter how small. \r\nTook our yearly 3% raises eventhough we had no real financial losses.\r\nThey highly frown upon working from home."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Absolutely awful!

I can't think of a single coworker or employee that I've talked to that likes working for the company which makes me wonder how they've won the Gallup great workplace award twice. The place is a scam. Human resources is a joke, literally. Since the last CEO and a former nurse replaced him the place has went downhill. After 20 years I decided that I didn't want to take part in a corporation that treats employees in the matter this corporation does. Only if the media could get ahold of how this place is run and the quality of care provided. If you are a board member or a member of executive management reading this, do the community and patients a favor. Listen to your employees. Without them you don't have patients. Without patients you wouldn't have a job. Your company is going to hit rock bottom of you don't.
