One person might tell you to do it one way, but the other person kind of belittles you because that's not the way it should have been done.

I know they belong somewhere that can handle their behaviors, but the staffing is always an issue. People get moved and rotated and the children have trouble with change as it is, I don't know why they do this. The staff at the \"headquarters\" is very rude and abrupt especially when you have questions about your payment or any questions at all. It is not a pleasurable place to work for/at and most people stay less than a year. \r\n\r\n Administration at the YCS Sawtelle facility believes they are correct in everything they say, but again everyone has a different \"correct\" view.

Before the year starts we have to get our classrooms \"approved\" on seating arrangements and everything. If we know the students, I do not see the problem. Sometimes students just want to be included and it's all trial and error. They almost do not trust you even as a teacher level and want to do everything themselves, but you do all the hard work.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of help such as in a headlock don't assume anyone of higher authority walking by will help. One of my head assistants happen to be passing by in the hallway and knew I needed help and if it weren't for her I probably would still be there in a headlock right now.
