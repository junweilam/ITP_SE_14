This organization used to be a happy place to work at, and now is falling apart thanks to the CEO and his executives. They do not care about employees, clients nor people that they pretend they are helping. They only care about how much money they\u2019ll put in their pocket. These positive comments are totally misleading. What the President/CEO does not realize is that the best way to have a good repution is to follow the policy, respect people and get rid of his arrogancy. Too many good employees  were fired for no reason and replaced with clueless leadership especially in HR and Operations. \r\nOnce full of competent staff and with great projects all over the world, this organization is doomed now with such a poor management and no projects left to be implemented. What is currently going on with Blumont is not surprising at all considering who decision makers are. I just don\u2019t understand why the board did not get involved when there was still time. \r\n\r\n\u201cVice Presidents\u201d think they have all power to run the world and the funny thing is that some of them never worked in international development, some of them are clueless about government contracts and regulations, and the rest have no idea what project management is. It\u2019s sad that these same people, including the CEO, make decisions that impact other poeple\u2019s lives. \r\n\r\nIf an individual has a strong educational background in the industry and does their job well, that same individual automatically becomes a threat - that individual will probably be fired very soon. Decisions are made based on that day\u2019s mood. If you invested in your education and yourself do not work here because there may be some jealous \u201cpowerful at the moment\u201d individuals who will sabotage your career. It happened so many times and it keeps happening.\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019ve seen at Blumont is truly hard to believe. All junior and other smart, eager, dedicated staff now feel demoralized, they are tired of promises and lies, and lack of opportunities for growth. \r\n\r\nI won\u2019t even mention compliance and ethic issues.
