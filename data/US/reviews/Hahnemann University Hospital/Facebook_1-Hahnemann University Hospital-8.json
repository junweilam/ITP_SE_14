Answering telephones, faxing paperwork, fixing broken printers and computers, heating up patients food, fixing televisions and phone issues. Drawing labs, getting vital signs, taking stat labs to the lab, picking up blood, and then documentation and taking care of the patients gets buried somewhere in there as well.
