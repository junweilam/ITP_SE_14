And during the recession, why are none of them eliminated to drive down costs?  Why does tuition go up for the students?  It sure is not because of adjunct professors.  (See administrative bloat and shiny new buildings).\r\n  \r\n I want to be fair:   tenure track profs are not wealthy (middle class)...but over half of the instructors are adjunct...meaning we are poor.   We love our work, but this is no living wages.  We are \"freeway fliers\" with other jobs. \r\n\r\n How poor are we?  We make one third the pay (plus we have no benefits) as tenure track profs (and some of adjuncts ARE, in fact Ph.D.s) for much of the same work.  Again, that does not mean that tenure track are wealthy.  I does mean that adjuncts are a lower tier, a lower caste as others doing much the same job.\r\n\r\n   If you are on tenure track, you did well and are also lucky.  Do not demean or belittle your fellow instructors (most of you don't).  But some of our administrators do.  One of us was told that we had \"no allegiance\" at all to any part timers...even after educating here for over a decade.   We are vital to our students; to some administrators and most trustees, NONE OF US MATTER.    \r\n\r\n Do not become an adjunct.  In fact, do not become a professor, as most of us will become adjuncts.  I know we often have little choice.  But if you can, get out. \r\n\r\nAdjunct instructors are not a \"gap\" in college education; we are now the majority.  If we went away, this college (in fact, ANY college) would disintegrate.
