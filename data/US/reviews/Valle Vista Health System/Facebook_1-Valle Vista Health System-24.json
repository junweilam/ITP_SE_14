They conveniently \"lose\" most of the paperwork that you turn into them. When I first started there, I turned in paperwork for direct deposit - two months later when I was still receiving a paper check, HR just had to say that my bank (whom I've been with the last 10 years) wasn't accepting my information and I'd have to resubmit. That's Valle's HR code for \"We lost your paper\"... Then we go to the matter of my orientation packet. I turned it in after my 6 shifts of orientation were completed - a year later when they were having HR files reviewed by corporate they realized mine wasn't in there and demanded I come to work and fill it out before they auditors arrived. Oh, and I've probably had 5 TB tests in the two years that I worked there because HR doesn't know how to file. \r\n\r\nLets move on to job. I'm an RN -- the pay sucks. You start out around $24ish an hour plus there's shift difs. The amount they pay you and the amount of work and crap you're expected to deal with are not even in the same galaxy. You have an EXTREMELY high rate of patient turnovers. On Mondays and Fridays, the heaviest with discharges and subsequently admissions, you could see 20+ leave and then fill right back up. When I first started, they didn't have an admissions nurse, which they have hired and that's helped some but for the two nurses and LPN working the books it's a mess... The patients can speak to you any way they please. They can stand at that window and cuss you out and you cannot really say anything to them because HR and the CEO will fire you in the blink of an eye. I have been on more than one occasion threatened and there is no one to call - no one will help you or stand up for you. They have rules on the unit, but if you break them, there are no consequences. Prime example is smoking. You'll have a multitude of patients that get cigarettes at visitation or try and smuggle them in during their admission and they'll smoke in their rooms. You catch them violating a clear hospital policy which has been explained to them on more than one occasion and then what happens - NOTHING. Why even make these rules if there's not going to be any consequences for violating them? Patient ratios... These are constantly at an unsafe ratio... You have one nurse to about 21 adult psych/detoxing patients. People that need monitored that you can't monitor because you're too busy getting yelled at by the patient that wants to leave AMA and the doc won't call you back. If your patient acuity goes up - your staffing does not reflect that. Detoxing patients and psych patients have no business being placed on the same unit and in the same rooms. They're needs are not even remotely in the same ballpark.. They will admit until they have all the beds full and then you're left to try and figure out the mess that has been created for you. If you don't have a bed, they will admit to an observation room which I'm pretty sure is illegal. Sometimes both your observation rooms will have patients in them and if there's a crisis situation you're screwed because you have no place left to go to provide care. \r\n\r\nAs far as providing care, you are just a pill pusher more than anything. Drug them up, give them Suboxone which most of them tell you they just leave and sell their scripts. You aren't making any kind of difference, you're just part of the problem. \r\n\r\nYou can't tell anyone in any kind of management roles your frustration because they will guilt trip you and use your words against you.
