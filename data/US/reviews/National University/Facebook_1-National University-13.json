This is a bad sign for those who have never been through something like this. The team started to throw rumors around, and then we asked the department above us if they all had the same alerts. In short, they did. Before we could even ask management what was happening, we all got an email that we were scheduled for a meeting in the next half hour. My manager, team, adjacent team, and team above us were all being let go that day. (around 40-50 people) You might not think anything is wrong with this situation at first glance. I fully understand that businesses make tough business decisions, and sometimes means, cuts must be made. However, they did not intend to release all these people in one day. They had leaked the layoffs via our timecards showing they took away our benefits when they did not mean to. They also stated several times there would not be any layoffs and that changes were coming but nothing to worry about. This is one of about 6 massive fumbles management has made in the past 3 months, from 401ks being terminated and moved to not giving raises despite evaluations and other things that did not make any sense. In short, the management is the reverse of King Midas. They turn everything into a disaster that they touch. These people with Master's and Doctorate degrees in Organizational Communication couldn't even conduct a professional layoff. Let that sink in; these educated people who have been moved around different universities all still have the same positions with consistently high-paying salaries. The bottom line is it's all a dog and pony show.

All employees at this university are underpaid for their services, especially if you work in the Admissions department. Last year the Chancellor addressed that the reason why we couldn't get higher merit (raises) was because he blamed the low enrollment numbers (indirectly blaming the Admissions Advisors). As an Admissions Advisor, you are expected to recruit new students and retain your current students and you are the only advocate for the student. Every month you have enrollment goals (although your pay is not dependent on the enrollment numbers). Upper management relies on reports that aren't accurately updated due to overwhelmed advisors. Each advisor has a work load of about 150+ students (if you're lucky) to about 350+ (if you've been there for a long time). The higher ups require that you always speak to your students by phone and always follow-up with an e-mail. The university trains you to guide the students from beginning to end. And by guide, I mean that as their advisor, it is your responsibility to remind students that they have to buy their textbook for first class, submit missing documents for Financial Aid to their Financial Aid advisor, submit transcripts for evaluation even though you've told them three times since they've enrolled... It gets even worse when the university cancels courses without explanation to the student but you're left explaining to a student why his or her degree is delayed. When students are on Academic Probation or Disqualification, it is the advisor's responsibility to call the student to inform them and advise them of their next steps. The university sends out systematic messages to our students but advisors STILL have to follow-up. There is no support---physically or emotionally. You'll always talk to management (your immediate supervisor) but nothing gets done. There is absolutely no open communication between departments, but you will be lucky if you can make a friend with someone who isn't from your department."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Another Enrollment Position", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Enrollment Advisor in Scottsdale, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "For the time being the work culture is nice , co workers are great.

My conclusion after enrolling in graduate courses and seeing all the administrative dirty laundry-VERY LOW. \r\n\r\nInnovation- Minimal to no training is provided on how to efficiently use new software and student database management system. Training and reference materials consist of outdated word documents stored in different locations. We have Sharepoint but management does not see the benefit of actually using it to collaborate.\r\n\r\nCollaboration- Pfft. Company culture is The Hunger Games- corporate version. Policies and procedures change willy-nilly and there is no transparency. \r\n\r\nDiversity- I\u2019ll give them that one. \r\n\r\nAccess- It\u2019s not for those who are NU employees AND students. Flexible scheduling is a benefit some staff members enjoy while others are denied the same benefit without a valid reason. Perhaps its their way of preventing staff from successfully using their tuition waiver. Maybe they enjoy the thought of employees sitting in soul-crushing commutes.
