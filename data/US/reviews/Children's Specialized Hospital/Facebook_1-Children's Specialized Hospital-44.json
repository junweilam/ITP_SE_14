Here's why...\r\n\r\n1.Unattainable productivity goals: You will be penalized if patients do not come to therapy and hounded to come in on your days off (including weekends) to work without compensation. For the purpose of treating and evaluating as many kids as possible,much needed supervision, meeting and paperwork write up times will be taken away from you to fill in more treatment spots. Because of this, you will be treating back to back without any breaks but your 30 minute unpaid lunch (which you will either spend doing paperwork to catch up ). Therapists are stressed and either stay at work late to do paperwork or take tons of work home because same day billing is the expectation. The constant pressure definetly takes a toll and unfortunately negatitivly impacts the quality of care you provide to your patients.  Vast majority of therapists are not meeting their volume expectations however children's is increasing their productivity expectations each year for the next three years.\r\n\r\n2. Top heavy management:. Too many cooks in the pot with each person telling you to do something totally different than the next. The left hand most certainly does not know what the right hand is doing. Unprofessional and provide no support.\r\n\r\n3. Fast turnaround: Therapists never stay employed here long...1-2 years max. It is like a revolving door of clinicians. People get fed up fairly quickly. \r\n\r\n4. No raises ever\r\n\r\n5. Contrdictory company values: children's prides itself on their corporate values. These values include integrity and compassion however the majority of things you are asked to do, totally contradicts these values. Children's is in the business of making money so you will be asked to do things that do not sit right with you morally for the sake of revenue. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. Lack of support: you will be asked, constantly, by management,  \"what can we do to support you?\" and when provided with a laundry list you will be denied and told \"it's not in the budget\".\r\n\r\n7. \"Unpaid lunch\" , however, management schedules mandatory meetings during this unpaid block of time. \r\n\r\nOverall I would not recommend employment at this company."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Unit Secretary I love being part of a team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Unit Secretary in New Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love being part of a team that's helping children achieve their potential.
