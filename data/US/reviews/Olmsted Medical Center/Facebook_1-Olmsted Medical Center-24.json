They don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with the switch. They will also change your work schedule when they feel like it. General practitioners suffer the most especially walk-in clinic staff so word of advice: avoid any jobs at Acute/Fastcare clinics. You\u2019ll be miserable everyday of your life there. Truthfully most providers here are currently looking for other opportunities. So if you are fortunate to have options save yourself the trouble and don\u2019t pick this place.
