Some have to struggle to use their PTO (and then the CEO says he won't increase PTO until everyone uses all of it). They rolled out parental leave to only half the company. Some roles do not allow fathers to take child leave. \nTreatment of supervisors - the management roles are easy to get because most good supervisors leave the company or drop down to an individual contributor. Upper management has no support for supervisors unless they're trying to cover up an injury to the public they caused, then they promote them and fire the employees under them.\nBad Supervisors - when the good supervisors leave due to their treatment they hire people who don't know how to lead and have no idea what the employees do. Dangerous in any setting with gas or electricity.\n\nBonuses are a joke - by the time it gets to employees it's so watered down that it's insulting. It's mostly based on the performance of the company so putting in 75% vs 120% shows nothing different with bonuses. The union employees (field and office) have a better option with a guaranteed 3% raise each year. It's amazing more employees aren't mad at the company for that and just joining the union.\n\nThey encourage putting employees against each other - they would rather have their employees be disgruntled at a different group than fix the problem to make them equal.\nTuition support has been the same amount for YEARS"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not worth the money", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Operations Analyst in Detroit, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The salary and the work experience will make it easier to get out of here", "cons": "They force you to be a part of \u201cteam engagements\u201d that nobody wants to be a apart of and don\u2019t care about Covid exposure.

It's a job. It pays money which pays the bills... like my DTE bill.\r\n2. The people there are probably the only reason I've stuck around as long as I have.\r\n3. When it was $14 an hour with paid vacation and holidays, working afternoons was worth it.", "cons": "1.\tNCO- If you don\u2019t work at DTE, you probably don\u2019t know this, but they contract out to an organization called NCO. NCO\u2019s only purpose, as far as can be determined, is to take your calls as quickly as possible. They\u2019ll tell you what you want to hear and get you off the line to take the next call. Not to say they\u2019re all incompetent, but I\u2019d say most of the time when you\u2019re calling back, it\u2019s because NCO either misinformed you or didn\u2019t place the right order to do the job you need done.\r\n2.\tCSB- The wonderful program DTE uses to schedule events. It likes to go down at random intervals and, whenever they do maintenance, rather than scheduling it for sometime during a midnight shift (when calls are typically at their lowest), they\u2019ll schedule them during morning or afternoons (granted, mainly on the weekend when calls are TYPICALLY lower, but not always the case). During this time, no order information or account information can be viewed. \r\n3.\tDowntime Forms- When the above program, CSB, is down, all Gas leaks and Outage calls have to be done on \u201cdowntime forms.\u201d These forms are Microsoft Word programs that need to be typed in manually and, for the outage forms, DO NOT LIST the questions you need pertinent to servicing the customer (such as, if there\u2019s a down wire, is it within reach, is it sparking, etc). Those questions have to be REMEMBERED by the reps doing the forms. Also, there are no safety precautions listed on the downtime forms, which are required to be stated for customer safety.\r\n4.\tBeing a Contractor: As per previous reviews, DTE treats their contractors poorly. When cuts came around with pay, contractors lost about $2 on average from their hourly pay (doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but it\u2019s almost the equivalent of working a four day week instead of five\u2026 which of course, wasn\u2019t an option). They also took away the paid vacations and holidays. Granted, we\u2019re contract, it\u2019s actually our company who did so, but that was ONLY because DTE would have fired us all last year around Christmas time had the changes not been made. After most of us had worked a year for them and gone through 3 WEEKS of training in a classroom and a week in a \u201cpod\u201d setting (btw, they also tested on the material taught during the classroom. If you failed ONE test, you were terminated). This year, they\u2019re eliminating the afternoon shifts and instead only allowing dayshifts. So, afternoon shifts (which handle 90% of the emergency calls) will now be moving to days and be forced to lose their premium and have to work on billing calls.\r\n5.\tOvertime- If call volume is up and Union doesn\u2019t want to stay, guess who is? Yup. Contract. You can\u2019t say no to it either. Oh, and if there\u2019s a storm and it so happens you\u2019re working the day before you\u2019re off? Guess what, you\u2019re probably coming in on your off day to talk to customers. You had a family event planned two months in advance? Sorry, you\u2019re working. Deal with it.\r\n6.\tRight Hand vs Left Hand- The system is broken. I might not know how to fix it, but I know something should be done. Customers wait the whole day for their services to be turned on (such as a restore) and are told it\u2019ll be between 8a-4:30p. Don\u2019t believe it. It can be anytime between 8a-10p and they have 24-48hrs once your payment posts. Oh, and if you\u2019re cut at the pole? 24-72hrs (but they\u2019ll tell you either that day or 24-48hrs, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re TOLD to tell you). And that\u2019s BUISNESS HOURS. Don\u2019t EVER get cut on a Friday or you\u2019re out till Monday! Granted, you had 3 months to pay your bill, but that seems harsh. Other things happen too, like a meter restore being sent out when it should be at the pole (BIG DIFFERENCE!!). That\u2019s not the reps fault either, the lovely CSB is suppose to catch that.\r\n7.\tNo career advancement- 2 years of being contract. Haven\u2019t been hired in, haven\u2019t seen anyone else move up. In fact, within the last year, they\u2019ve been demoting contract members (analysts back to customer care representatives). The most you can do is go from being a residential customer care rep to a commercial or escalated call rep."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Principal", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Genuinely care about employee engagement and safety.
