This company doesn\u2019t abide by their values it sounds good though, management cares more about meeting financial goals than great quality work vs quantity to bring in revenue and the mental sanity of the staff (burn out). There is NO training you sink or swim and having staff deal with revenue you would think there would be thorough revenue cycle training since you\u2019re dealing with the finances but Rush lives up to their name, they R U S H! The turnover is high, the morale is extremely low and nepotism is a HUGE problem. You have to pay for parking which is INSANELY expensive along with the Rush gym. As much as we contribute to the company it should be paid. The PTO is a joke (paid Holidays comes out of your own PTO bank), you have to use your cellphone to work and we weren\u2019t reimbursed nor did we receive a stipend for cellphone usage or buying our own equipment, we had to buy our own equipment if we didn\u2019t already have a computer and micromanagement is extremely HIGH.

There is no clear leadership, inclusion of the users in decisions, nor good communication. A training program is almost non-existent. \r\n \r\n Management uses email for announcements usually for that day, but the techs don\u2019t have time to use the couple of computers available in the lab to read it. Brief huddle meetings don\u2019t address prospective changes. LIS software (SOFT) is not user friendly, takes too long to learn, too many quirks. Program QA is lacking.

Not enough people there to handle the workload which is very uneven. Techs rotate benches daily. They work every other weekend. \r\n\r\nBuy your holidays with PTO time if you want to get paid for them when off. Supervisors work on projects, not necessarily supervise people. They don\u2019t work weekends; a senior tech is in charge. No money for continuing education. Vacation requests now have to be submitted months in advance. High turnover, so those vacation requests will likely be moot. Administration has cut muscle, not just fat. Lab tests help pay to keep the hospital running. It seems the administration has forgotten that.\r\n\r\nChemistry analyzers (Abbott Architects) break down daily. Phones don\u2019t work properly and are not fixed even when called in. The lab doesn\u2019t even stock permanent markers--they cost 88 cents at WalMart and are necessary to label tubes and reagents. Disposable paper smocks have been on back order for weeks. Vendors are changed without lab staff input. \r\n\r\nBleak lab environment--hasn't changed in over two decades.  Equipment is made to fit in odd corners.  Women\u2019s restroom doesn\u2019t exhaust. No drinking fountain in the lab. We wheel full garbage toters from the breakroom to the hallway to await weekly pickup. Cleaning services are spotty. \r\n\r\nRemaining techs answer phones, re-do clerical work for orders which may not have been input properly, re-print and re-label many tubes because the label printers on the floors or the professional clinics print too faintly for the lab instruments to read--wasting valuable analytical/validation time. \r\n\r\nHave to punch in and out with rules that are still not clear to all of us. There is no clear leadership, inclusion of the users in decisions, nor good communication.  A training program is almost non-existent. \r\n\r\nManagement uses email for announcements usually for that day, but the techs don\u2019t have time to use the couple of computers available in the lab to read it. Brief huddle meetings don\u2019t address prospective changes.  LIS software (SOFT) is not user friendly, takes too long to learn, too many quirks. Program QA is lacking. Their online policy and procedures are not kept up well.\r\n\r\nParking is often hard to find in the high-rise lot. The spaces are so close together, sometimes re-entering our vehicles is almost impossible. No security patrol between shifts.  Can eat in the inadequate break room or go to the muffin shop concourse.
