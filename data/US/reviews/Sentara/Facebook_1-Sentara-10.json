They sit like a bump on a log sucking up money, resources, Space and Goodwill until the shift ends.\n\nCorporate changed HR tools. Many staff members have had their insurance canceled with no urgency from HR or management to reinstate the insurance. When insurance was reinstated over a month later, staff were back charged for the time when there was no coverage. \n\nThis change over also wiped out vacation banks. Some co-workers were unable to pay bills because when they were on vacation, the bank was wiped with the change meaning they were not paid. Again, zero urgency to correct the issue.\n\nTravel nurses get kicked out of the charting system when contracts are renewed. Not all of them; it\u2019s an adventure to figure out who will not be able to chart on any given shift. \n\nAll the med machines were replaced. This was not thought out. Patients had to hold because units had no access to medications. Also many many glitches similar to the traveler charting issue.\n\nStaffing: one day your floor will have 12 nurses and half will be called off. The next day they will have two and beg you to come in. Sometimes this occurs within the same day.\n\nEverything is routed through Sentara\u2019s call center. The longest lag time I counted for a code activation was 6 minutes from the call to overhead page.\n\nWhen you contact IT with an issue, you are told it is a non issue. For example don\u2019t have access to something you need? IT either says yes you do it it\u2019s someone else\u2019s issue-even when that other person can show they submitted requests properly. Ap cut out and you can\u2019t log in? You did something wrong. Is your department\u2019s phone not receiving critical alerts (see overhead code issue above). Yes it is. They do not care that 3 people have the same issue. It is always user error.\n\nEquipment and processes are outdated and redundant probably to keep the grandfathered staff employed.\n\nEvery day I wish I never left my old job and am actively looking for a new one. Most individual nurses and NCPs are amazing but are exhausted battling the system that makes everything 100 times more difficult every day.\n\nMerit raises were incorrect some went negative. Holiday pay was left off of a lot of checks.\n\nThe pay is good if they actually pay you, but you will probably never have time to enjoy it.

Also, if you're of the mindset \"nurses eat their young\", then this is the place for you.

(ex. 1:7 pt ratio with ZERO techs, yet they expect everyone to be dry and clean by morning, drop everything and run to every bed alarm, have all your labs and vitals done by yourself, turn and reposition all your total pts while still maintaining to do a NCP/RN job duties, etc.)\r\n*** High-turn over rate: People can't make it past the 1st three months off orientation.

Some have even been thrown in without the guidance of their preceptor.  DO NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY TELL YOU THE RATIO IS 5-6 PATIENTS PER NURSE. IT IS A LIE. YOU WILL HAVE 7-8 PATIENTS AND AT TIMES WITHOUT A NCP/TECH SUPPORT. CHARGE RN's ARE RUNNING WITH 7 PATIENTS. THIS IS THE NORM.\r\n- Career Opportunities and advancement: Some will flat-out tell you that you're unqualified and not ready to transition to a different unit because of desperation to keep you on the floor. An employee was held for 5 months prior to transitioning, who's had years of experience and was told they \"aren't ready.\" Will go behind your back and try to ruin your chances before you can transfer out. \r\n- Favoritism / Racism: There is a certain preference and if you fit it, you will survive on this floor.
