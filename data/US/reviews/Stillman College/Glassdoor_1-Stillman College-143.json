A few caring professors that they can't keep due to horrible pay and ridiculous leadership that respects no one. The few that stay are dedicated to the cause of educating students and don't do it for the money. Unfortunately, these professors are very few in number. Their reward truly will be in heaven because it sure as heck isn't in the form of their checks.", "cons": "Cons are in abundance here. Turnover is extremely high. Salary is pathetic. No automatic deposit because they can't cover faculty/staff salaries and need a letter of credit from the bank every month (or so that's the rumor). Furlows twice for faculty and staff in a 12 month period. No shared governance. Deans are clueless. Transfer students often lose a lot of credit because the deans do the evaluations and don't know what courses substitute and instead of sending them to subject matter experts (the professors) they just put everything in as \"elective\" credit. Facilities are poor, classes are often overloaded with no additional compensation. All the good faculty leave before they are type-hired at this institution. Academic standards for most departments are VERY low. You can't teach the courses the way they need to be taught otherwise most of your students would fail. In my opinion, the majority of the students are nowhere near college ready and the first year needs to be entirely remedial. They would fare better financially and educationally to get up to par at the local community college up the street. Poor financial aid packages for students. Horrible benefit package and lousy pay. Smoking is allowed on campus!! Come ON!!!!!!! School is on the verge of going bankrupt. I wouldn't be surprised if they ended up as the next Morris Brown. I give them another 3 years tops and they'll likely be on probation. They might get it together but I sure as heck wasn't sticking around to find out.
