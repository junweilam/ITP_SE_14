Also, a lot of the case managers left this year because they either graduated or for personal reasons unrelated to the work. This means that the staff is going to have to rebuild next year, which may mean the team dynamic will be much different. Honestly, there aren't a lot of cons as long as you enjoy case management. If you are looking at this job as a form of professional development, just know that you will have to take the initiative to ask for, create, and find those professional development opportunities because sometimes the job gets so busy that you get stuck just case managing for awhile (which of course is still a good skill to build)."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Studying at DU", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good School and Good Faculty", "cons": "It doesn't have many research labs"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Typical Gym job, below average hourly pay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Coors Fitness Center Front Desk Associate in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Entitled to a free gym membership if working hours met the requirements", "cons": "Minimum wage pay with little to no room to move up"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Sales in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good environment to work in.", "cons": "Not much room to grow."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong supportive community and Flexible, family friendly environment.

Allow me to shed some light on how this soul sucking entity operates. I worked in their IT division for quite some time. Saw a lot of changes over the years, but nothing prepared us for the Reckoning when their current Vice Chancellor & CIO took over. He advocated and created a culture of blame and authoritarianism parallel to what is currently happening in the Trump Administration. Experienced senior leadership that was in place for years were removed or ousted in favor of managers that had literally zero experience in their respective departments. This current leadership follows by example and continues to hire and promote those who only show one quality: blind fanaticism and unquestionable loyalty. Anyone else with actual intelligence or experience were frequently passed over for promotions. If any employee questions any process or decision, they are immediately flagged by management as a danger to their system of control. Many of these employees were systematically targeted by management and performed down in annual reviews, perpetually harassed, gaslit, and constantly attacked by lies of underperformance, attitude, or performance issues. Many talented employees have already quit and the rest that remain live in a constant state of fear and low morale. Every month more employees put in their resignation letters like rats off a sinking ship. New hires do not last very long and turnover is very high. Many existing employees are on anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medications due to the severe hostile work environment. Critical infrastructure and support is on the verge of catastrophic failure, all due to management\u2019s lack of experience and negligence to take the advice of their engineers seriously. Its a House of Cards. Enterprise standards are laughed at and decisions are seemingly made by throwing darts at a board. Management doesn\u2019t want to take the time to understand or learn the technicals behind their own environment they manage so as to make better decisions. They only want results and then blame their engineers, developers or support specialists when things go off the rails. They own zero accountability. Some managers scream at their subordinates, others publicly ridicule them in front of others. Still yet the ones who appear to be nice and understanding simply lie to your face to placate you. Some of the worst managers are so controlling, they act like it\u2019s the military and micromanage every facet of your role, leaving out any delegation or decision making. Processes are burdened by a complete lack of communication back from management and approvals from them seemingly never get approved due to this. The backlash from employees have been in the form of a stack of HR complaints and employee separation interviews. Worst part is that HR has acknowledged they are not willing to step in and make any real changes, despite the volume of real, proven, and collaborated evidence showcasing a clear hostile work environment. \r\n\r\nThis place is your worst nightmare and you should avoid it at all costs."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Potential for Greatness", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Strategic Research Consultant in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work is really interesting and has real world impact.
