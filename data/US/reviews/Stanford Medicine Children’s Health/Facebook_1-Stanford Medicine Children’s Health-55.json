In the past employees were able to take time off in a timely manner. There are some days where your time off may be denied which was completely fine however taking time off appears to be a dime a dozen. Favoritism comes a factor when it comes to taking time off since management has their favorites and their non favorite employees.  There are a few employees who are having their time off approved consistently while the rest of the technicians struggle on making switches with others to ensure there is proper coverage. Talk about being fair right?\r\nAnother con is with working together. Throughout my career, employees were working together however it appears there is a lot of finger pointing and no resolutions to problems that occur on a daily basis.
