Was provided with extremely long, dry, and dense powerpoint slides to read off of, much of which did not even pertain to my job role.  Much of the software they use is exclusive to their company and it is very difficult to learn; it could take weeks for you to learn how to use them. Employees RE also expected to immediately catch on to workplace lingo. There is overwhelmingly too  much unfamiliar terminology that is used in one place. It felt as if they were speaking their own language; most of the acronyms they use aren't even used in the real world. \r\n\r\nSecondly, some of the details in the job description were not clearly explained prior to starting the job. Initially,  wasn't clearly made aware of which departmental trainings I was supposed to assist in facilitating, which resulted in me missing a a few of them. With that said, it was difficult to fully understand the purpose of the job role if you are expected to be at two or more places at one time. \r\n\r\nThirdly, the supervisor lacked in sufficient communication. After missing the couple of departmental trainings during my training period, \r\n\r\nFourthly, the environment felt uncomfortable because some of the staff's insubordinate behavior. HR employees are backstabbers as well.  Even after I  left, there was still animosity from employees as well. \r\n\r\nIn closing, for this being my first ever full-time job, right after graduating from a four year institution, was a hostile work environment. No one should walk into work every single day dreading to work somewhere, where it's known that some of the employees are doing/saying underhanded things about you. I  regret not saying anything to hold these people accountable, at the same token, I did everything in my power to remain professional and mature to the very end. Another issue is the cliquiness. It was difficult to fit in with the majority of employees because there were numerous cliques and new employees such as myself felt outcasted. I honestly felt as if I was in high school all over again. I think the catty underhanded behavior that I mentioned previously was highly unprofessional and set a bad precedence for me as a new employee. I must say that I am beyond relieved that I left this unfit company. I  wish for whoever  takes on any other position at WES, is highly cognizant of the company culture, environment, and deceitful actions of some of the employees."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Staff is treated like filth (so sad)", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Evaluator in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Paid time off rolls over year to year.\r\n\r\nDiverse workplace.", "cons": "You know when I first started I loved it here.

Our manager is horrible to people which HR covers up. They now came up with a new production model to increase the quota even more which puts even more pressure on us. I would have to skip my lunch to make it which they say is illegal. It's not worth it anymore.  So many people feel demoralized. I think WES went one step too far with this. There are so many problems that aren't fixed but now it's getting unbearable. They make us do these surveys but don't do anything about the results. They know it's bad but they don't care. Without my team lead I wouldn't have lasted long. The company puts enormous pressure on us when our software hasn't worked properly in 2 months. I was hoping the new CEO would help turn things around but it seems she doesn't really care about employees and that's crushing. I still think she's a nice person though and wish her well.
