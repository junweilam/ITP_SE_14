In my work history of 6 years and 3 companies, I have not seen a more mis-managed organization than this.\r\n\r\nSome of the highlights of bad management and brutal wastage of resources\r\n1) Qualified and well-educated engineers, lab-technicians are poorly treated. It does not matter if what an employee says is right or not, he/she must do what the management says.\r\n2) They are trying to solve very large data intensive Computer Science problems and the people who make almost all the decisions such as which hardware to get, how should different components talk to each other have very limited CS knowledge.\r\n3) There were several instances where due to management planning failures, they had less computing resources than required for proper operation. As a result, genome data costing thousands of dollars to generate was lost.\r\n4) They have no concept of Software Engineering design. This is a huge mistake as bad software tools can easily increase the computation time substantially, especially in large data systems like DNA sequencing platforms. For example, a badly developed tool to call SNP on Illumina data was taking days instead of hours.\r\n5) Lack or coordination between different groups generally makes it a lot hard to get anything done. Each group behaved like an autonomous unit instead of working coherently with other \r\n \r\nA strong evidence of these drawbacks is that there is continuous exodus of employees from there."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Could have stayed longer if not for growth", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Academia.

Most administrative staff are over worked as upper management does not allow departments to open up vacancies as their department's grow. Increasing work loads just keeps getting dumped on the same people. This has been going on for years. Unfortunately the straw that broke the camel's back was when HR decided to \"revise\" all the administrative titles in 2019. In doing so they moved everyone down 1 to 2 paygrades. They completely eliminated titles in the upper pay grades, leaving no ladder for many of us to climb. Lowering the pay grades meant many would no longer be eligible for a pay raise - EVER - because they had already met the new cap. This was a huge failure and misstep on Baylor's part. They took away incentive for people who had been there for decades to care about reaching new goals and continue in their professional growth. \r\n\r\nBottom line is if you a physician or medical staff you will probably get paid and treated fairly.

If you have a PhD your funding is almost always NIH or NSF grants, with award rates around 10-20%.  This can be distracting from research, constantly writing deadend proposals, particularly if the grants are small and you are cobbling them together to keep afloat.  This is not a problem created by BCM, it is a national funding problem of how seriously we value STEM.\r\n\r\nIf you are a successful PI, you will have a good salary (120k-300k).  Everyone else tends tends to be below (40k-70k) comparable commercial market salaries, figure 10-50% below average.  If you are staff and seek long-term financial promotion, either seek a degree there or move on after a few years.\r\n \r\nBecause they work horse graduate students almost till they drop, the attitude is the same for staff, expecting long hours without additional compensation.

The location is great for networking and being at the center of research and clinical development is something that institutions outside of the Medical Center lack. At least on paper, it seems that the partnership with Catholic Health Initiatives has increased job security for most Faculty and Staff... However, take that with a grain of salt.", "cons": "Perhaps the biggest con is that the administration and upper-management frankly does not care about staff. It's wonderful if you are faculty but be prepared to be thrown under the bus if you are employed as a staff member. BCM states that it \"...remains committed to their (employees) dedication and pledge to recognize individual uniqueness and engage all constituencies in guiding our path to excellence in all missions.\" BCM also states that it is \"...dedicated to recruiting outstanding faculty, staff, and trainees...\" These statements are nothing more than lip-service and their actions towards staff speak for themselves. \r\n\r\nBCM offers meaningless table scraps in terms of wages for staff positions. For example, a Medical Genetics Technologist I salary is UP TO $40,000. Be prepared to accept a figure as much as $7,500 dollars lower if you apply at BCM. The average salary for a Medical Genetics Technologist according to the Department of Academic Affairs at MD Anderson Cancer center is $42,000 to $46,000. A recent job posting listed an annual salary of $30,000 for a clinical laboratory position, which requires undergraduate degree, but the Houston, TX median annual salary is listed as $63,041 by a reputable salary website. The bottom 10% is $53,638. The data speaks for itself. BCM does not offer competitive wages.\r\n\r\nAlso, do not expect any salary increases during your employment at BCM. Departmental mismanagement is rife and departmental deficits seem to be the norm. The normal course of action in the mind of a BCM administrator is to punish the employees who actually perform the work that brings in the revenue. Perhaps this is the normal course of action at any institution; however, there is a greater chance that those other institutions actually offer a competitive salary to begin with. Be prepared to be scrutinized for every minute and every penny because we all know that it is the staff making the big bucks. \r\n\r\nDo not expect any potential for growth in your career. The administration is perfectly content with adding responsibilities and duties to your job without actually promoting you. It's also not uncommon to be setup for failure in the institution. The administration will eventually place so many demands and responsibilities that were not yours when you were hired. When you're unable to complete all of those duties, you will be terminated."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "It all depends on the primary investigator, talk with the current staff and postdocs beforehand.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Oct 2010", "job_title": "Staff Scientist in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good funding opportunities allows for continuing research.", "cons": "Poor management decisions have left BCM financially crippled.
