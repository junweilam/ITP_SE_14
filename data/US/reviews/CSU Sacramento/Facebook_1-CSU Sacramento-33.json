CSUS pays poverty level wages to its staff and wastes millions of dollars every year hiring people whose salaries are unjustifiable. Why does every college within the university need multiple deans or directors who do student assistant level work? Our deans act as hall monitors who spend their days being unproductive and counting the minutes until you are back from a break. Most fast food places in California pay more than CSUS does, and at least at a fast food place you get discounted food. Benefits are horrible here, the unions are ineffective and condescending, and I use about 10% of my monthly income for prescriptions alone. Opportunities for advancement are abysmal. I was propositioned to take a promotion which would have entailed 2x-4x more work, but was only offered 0.25% greater pay. When I started here they told me they do not negotiate salaries, even though I had years of relevant experience and previous experience working here. This place is full of terrible leadership who use their positions as a safety net for them to do nothing and get paid for it. Ineffective and verbally abusive faculty are promoted to associate dean, then promoted to dean; while simultaneously protecting sexual predators who have a documented history of harassing students. Or how about directors who were let go from UC Berkeley for being terrible at their job, only to get a very similar position at CSUS. What a great message, that we will take people who were deemed not fit for employment at notable schools. It is safe to say that if someone is a dean or director at CSUS, that they are probably terrible at their job and in no way justify the salary they take from the university."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Was Alright", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 May 2023", "job_title": "Student Safety in Sacramento, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great campus, great environment, decent people.", "cons": "Poor pay, unruly students at times."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "24 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Lecturer in Sacramento, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Inclusive work environment.
