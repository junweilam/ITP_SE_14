They want you to learn all you can and will help you along the way. Management and Lead Techs are phenomenal people and are very friendly. Lots of free food and fun things offered to everyone. Techs are so fun to work with they do their jobs well. It doesnt get too crazy, especially during the evening shifts and weekends. As a tech you do deliveries to All floors, ER, ICU, CCU, and OR which is a great experience. Software system and tools used in pharmacy are great\u2014Pharmacist manager utilizes new ideas for easy  delivery to omnicells. If you do your job well and efficiently you will have frequent little breaks throughout your shift where you can just hang around, get a snack, or do something around the pharmacy\u2014if you want something to do then you will find it\u2014or just ask the lead techs if you\u2019re bored. Pharmacists for the most part are all super nice and they even get little gifts for everyone during the holidays, its very sweet. Everyone helps each other out, we are all responsible for a smooth running pharmacy. Parking for evening and overnight shift is great because after 2PM the hospital parking deck is open to all employees and there are lots of spaces to park. Otherwise, parking deck is strictly only for seniority of hospital staff. Benefits and pay are pretty good. Pay was 16.75, with an Evening and Overnight differential an additional $2.75. There are some techs that have been offered a higher base pay\u2014depends on experience. I definitely recommend working here!", "cons": "The IV room smells really bad for some reason. Some of the techs in the morning shift can get pretty catty and clique-y, but just pretend to be nice and they wont get in your face. Some of the pharmacists seem to have neurotic personalities, some are cool but when they get stressed then they start barking at you, some pharmacists you wonder wth they are doing because they can make mistakes. Other than those few special ones, the rest of the pharmacists are great and have awesome personalities. The Mckesson automated machine can sometimes break down, which can get annoying, but its quickly fixable. The cafeteria food can seriously get better... some days it can be a hit or miss. Anything under $5 you have to pay cash only. The main lobby cafe could be better too. Some of their food is OK but the rest is pretty mediocre, I have gotten nauseous from eating their wraps. Occasionally pharmacists will ask you to make a delivery to a floor you arent assigned that shift, but you have to delivery it on top of your own workload, it can get tiring. The TPN bags are huge and take up a lot of space in your little delivery cart, leaves little room for everything else, but bigger carts would be more of a hassle probably when going down the nursing floors.  Parking was bad for morning shift\u2014you had to park at a separate lot and had to take a shuttle bus to the hospital. When you get hired you have to work the morning shifts for awhile regardless of which position you applied for\u2014this is because the morning/day shifts are the busiest and you learn more compared to the laid back quiet evening shift. If you\u2019re working evening, you may not get any of the awesome free food that the day shift occasionally gets, but they sometimes remember to leave some scraps behind!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "RN Review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "7 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Staff RN in Summit, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is ok, working every 3rd weekend (instead of every weekend).", "cons": "So many protocols and paperwork (youre doing double the work since you also have to put it in the computer).
