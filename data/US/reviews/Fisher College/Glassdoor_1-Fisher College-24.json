Program directors have no resources whatsoever and no way to support adjuncts in their jobs. School does not seem to care much about students welfare, the administrative staff was ready to expel anyone regardless of their situation. There were students with seriously bad home situations I tried to help along, but the school would continue to insist I flunk them. This is really too bad, because I actually enjoyed working with students and seeing them succeed when some other professors expressed open hatred for their classes.
