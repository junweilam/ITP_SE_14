To start I worked there for almost two years while getting my degrees. In that time I felt discriminated against based on the actions carried out. Still till this day never got an explanation as to why she was like this or an apology. \r\n\r\nHowever, it was hard to feel like it wasn\u2019t because of my race. While I never like to play the race card I really have no other explanation for the things she did. \r\n\r\nLets begin. Around being at the bindery for a year the bindery lead was graduating and her position would be available for another bindery worker to take. The leads got paid a dollar more and as a college student even that dollar counts (but funny looking back on it now that I\u2019m graduated and salaried). The leadership over the bindery decided that even though I had been there the longest out of anyone there at the time that a new girl would take this position. Mind you I trained her for the position. Now I know just being at a job longer doesn\u2019t qualify you to get promotions but thats what they decided. After five months the new bindery lead rather unfortunately passed away. While this time was sad I didn\u2019t want to be the person that tries to immediately try to take someone that died position so I didn\u2019t want to ask for the position directly.\r\n\r\nA new coworker at the time asked me around this time \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll get the position.\u201d I told him no if anything you will because the bindery leadership doesn\u2019t like me. A week later he had the position. I had been there a year and five months and passed over twice for new people that I both trained. \r\n\r\nNow to comments the leadership gave me   As this is not all about getting passed up twice. I once opened the bindery up at 7a. Bindery leadership comes in and I asked if we were out of flash-drives. As we used to sell them to students and faculty. Immediately she rudely tells me. \u201cUgh I don\u2019t know are we\u201d. I had already looked around and didn\u2019t see if we had stock and she had a special key to check other closets for inventory. None the less she pissed me off but I held my tongue and said nothing. \r\n\r\nOn another day I was working on a weekend. A student that had just graduated came into the store and wanted to buy school merch because he was an online student and this was his first time visiting the school. If you\u2019ve ever worked a cashier job before you would know that if someone needs change for bills sometimes its frowned upon to give the person a ton of change in quarters, nickels, etc. Well on this day we had almost no bills and I didn\u2019t know whet to do. So I asked what should I do. Without saying a word she rushes over to the cash register like a maniac and starts slamming quarters, nickels, etc. onto the counter. The guy buying the merch even told her that she didn\u2019t need to have an attitude and throw change. Real nice image of the school his first visit. After he leaves she tries to tell me that she wasn\u2019t mad/upset, but she was just saving face even though she clearly did this in front of another person other than me that would agree about the unnecessary attitude. I didn\u2019t believe her as I had interrupted her from unloading boxes and she hated my guts for whatever reason. \r\n\r\nShe once even probed me with questions after telling her that I would not be able to come in the next day after getting my wisdom removed as some sort of way to give me a write up or fire me even though it was well within my right to call out and I gave ample notice. I know this had to be a way of trying to get me in trouble because of all my time working there I was never asked how I was doing (not that I needed them to ask) and yet all of a sudden an interest is taken in having my teeth pulled. Not suspicious at all. \r\n\r\nI took all of these issues to my bosses boss and laid it out for him in a meeting with another coworker.  I detailed how she has never liked me for no apparent reason, passed other staff and I up for brand new employees that we trained. In this meeting he blew smoke up or rears and nothing ever came of the meeting other than him talking with his employee/friend and she now had to tread carefully as now I had made a formal complaint. Luckily he no longer works for the school. \r\n\r\nI then tried to apply for a student ambassador position at the school to get out of my situation. You apply by sending your email to the lady that manages HR for the school at the time. Thats when I get an email from my bosses boss that I had the meeting with that he \u201cHeard a rumor I was thinking of leaving\u201d. Clearly he had been talking with the HR lady because if he could read minds that would be an impressive thing to put on a resume. \r\n\r\nHe was also good friends with his employee so I knew telling him would be a risk. But I knew from his email that he would be of no help and that I\u2019d have to go to someone even higher.  \r\n\r\nI then went to the provost of the school and told him this whole story along with print outs of the emails I had received. Long story short he also did absolutely nothing and just told me \u201cWe need to improve student and faculty relations\u201d. \r\n\r\nAll of this happened between 2013-15 and the leadership is still there till this day. When she should have just been let go because I was not the only one she was rude and disrespectful to."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management is a mess.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Bindery Operator in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It was an on site job for students for the university, so convenience was huge since I lived at the dorms nearby.
