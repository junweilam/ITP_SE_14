Even on approved days off requests over the weekend in the summer, I was still called and asked to do work remote. During the school year, the usual routine was to work on campus, come home and continue to work until I went to bed. Work would quickly pile up and frazzle management, and often times I would not be supported or given guidance to help remedy the situation I was put in. The department I worked in was a not the most organized and could definitely be described as dysfunctional. Sometimes, asking for help would stress the people who told me I could reach out to them if I needed anything and the situation would become much more stressful and dysfunctional. On numerous occasions, I've been asked to assignments that I wasn't qualified for, or would require me to postpone work on projects that I was already working on. This would then lead to a cycle of making compromises that upper management wouldn't like despite them contributing to the reasons you're in that situation."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Graduate Research Assistant Salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You will be covered with Health and Tuition Benefits", "cons": "Little stressful if the advisor's guidance is not proper"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Assistant in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Inclusive work environment with supportive staff", "cons": "Work hours are not equally distributed"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent place for staff, faculty, and students", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Coordinator in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Leadership is respectful of all considerations and the community works as a team", "cons": "Budget restraints make certain areas of growth a challenge"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Overall a great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Tech Services Manager in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive Environment Talented and Caring Management Professional Development Opportunities Excellent Benefits Package", "cons": "Since it is not a \"for profit\" organization, the salary was not as competitive but the excellent benefits package and generous leave policy mostly made up for that."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Job Experience at UMBC", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Desk Assistant in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible Hours, Competitive Pay, and Amazing Team.", "cons": "Late night shifts and weekend shifts"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good campus job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 May 2023", "job_title": "Student Athlete Tutor in Catonsville, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, great atmosphere, helping student athletes with their work", "cons": "Some student athletes do not take it seriously"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Solid Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 May 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Department I worked at had great fellow staff and environment for work.
