Everyone gets to understand and experience the important differences between democracies and dictatorships through the organization\u2019s work, and to personally meet activists on the ground that fight against dictatorship. If you really appreciate the democratic system (whether in the U.S., Canada or Costa Rica or Spain), and really have a disdain for governments who rule tyrannically around the world (from North Korea, Russia, to China, to Iran), you cannot find a better organization in the human rights movement to work for.\r\n\r\nCompensation and work-life balance: Great salaries overall, considering the rest of the nonprofit industry. I started as an intern and was paid $1,000 per month at a time when Human Rights Watch did not pay interns. Excellent health, dental, vision and other benefits. Flexible policy on employees working remotely. I also knew of an employee that, as part of her work arrangement, did not come in on Fridays.\r\n\r\nSize: Also a pro, but with downsides, the organization remains relatively small, with employees never exceeding 30 at any given time. This allows the organization flexibility to act quickly in campaigns when activists get imprisoned, but it also diminishes opportunities for long-term career promotions and significant compensation in an extremely expensive city like New York, which can be challenging.\r\n\r\nManagement: People in management are very professional, and keen on receiving feedback, and acting to improve and fix any perceived shortcomings. This is also a positive aspect of the organization remaining relatively small. Management is majority female, which reflects the overall demographics of the organization.\r\n\r\nDomestic v. International Politics: The organization generally does NOT engage in domestic political debates. However, the organization does engage democratic governments in an attempt to make them allies in exposing the issues in authoritarian regimes, and to make them understand the dangers of authoritarianism taking over, even in democratic nations.\r\n\r\nDiversity: Truly diverse work environment. The organization has employees from 10 or 12 different countries in the world and the founder is an open LGBTQ person and advocate for minority rights both in the U.S. and in the countries that repress sexual-orientation minorities (Chechnya, China, Iran, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, etc.). A lot of organizations pay lip service to diversity but HRF truly embodies this diversity\u2014people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, who agree that exposing authoritarianism should the top priority to fix the world. The organization is two thirds female\u2014including in management\u2014and my experience is that they are considerate and excellent professionals\u2014from universities that are top notch: Columbia, Stanford, Penn, etc. \r\n\r\nAs to recent unfair bad reviews on Glassdoor: I have attended multiple Oslo Freedom Forums. The organization carries out several large conferences around the world. In my more than 5 years in the organization, I have never seen anyone from management or the president, or any male staff doing anything inappropriate, nor have I witnessed or heard about actions that would be considered sexual harassment against any man or woman whether on staff or not. Most of the male employees are openly gay (the organization is largely female and gay men outnumber straight men). Anonymous Glassdoor accusations that the organization is always \u201csiding with the offender\u201d and that \u201crampant sexual harassment\u201d happens are absolutely false. For what I\u2019ve asked around, I heard there were two incidents over ten years where a conference attendee behaved inappropriately. These individuals (who are not members of staff but conference attendees) allegedly made advances to members of staff (for context, these weren\u2019t accusations of rape or groping\u2014but broad unwelcome advances by a drunkard conference attendee at a bar). The reaction from management upon finding out was swift and forceful. These people were told they were NOT welcome and disinvited to attend any future conference. So, the organization sided immediately with the person making the accusation. Management did not consider any \u201cdue process\u201d of the accused, but instead immediately acted to listen to and believe the victim, and to disinvite the suspected offender. I agree with this position because, especially in times of the #metoo movement, it is absolutely understandable to NOT give the benefit of the doubt to any conference attendee that gets drunk and as much as appear as acting in any way inappropriately with regard to a member of staff (or any other conference attendee), whether female or male.", "cons": "No 401K plan.

Organization as a whole lacks robust processes, but that's partially intentional because management doesn't believe in bureaucracy in such a small organization. So the up side of this is that at times everyone feels equal and can have their ideas heard, but the downside is that sometimes efficiency is lower because of the lack of processes.

The wildly inappropriate behavior I witnessed and experienced at this organization from top-level leadership is shocking to everyone I tell the stories to. \r\n\r\nThis organization, though it\u2019s 10 years old, still operates like a disorganized start-up in the early stages. Employees in the NY office are crammed into a loud and hectic \u201copen office\u201d space. No retirement plan, professional development budget, or home office stipends. No HR department, no real procedure or protocol for anything, no solid job descriptions or reporting structure (at least none that are actually adhered to), and sexual assault claims are dismissed and berated.\r\n\r\nContractors have gone unpaid for months or longer. Mid and lower-level employees are severely overworked and underpaid, and often expected to be available at all hours. I would often work on my commute, all day without a lunch break, on my commute back, and then again at home on a minimal starting salary. Pleas for more staff would be dismissed due to finances, while we continued to struggle to manage the workload of 2-3 people each. Employees regularly experienced chest pains, anxiety attacks, ulcers, etc. from the stress.\r\n\r\nHigh turnover rate and lack of sufficient staff means positions are often billed to potential employees as being able to create your own job description, with opportunities for rapid advancement, and the opportunity to work with a \"growing/changing organization\" - that means you'll be constantly overworked and asked to do things way outside of the job description you signed up for.\r\n\r\nWhile core and lower-level staff were primarily women from a diverse range of backgrounds, leadership is all men. They\u2019ve said to all staff on multiple occasions that they \u201cdo not care about office diversity\u201d and \u201cjust hire the right people for the job\u201d (direct quotes), which usually means hiring upper-level staff directly from their own network without the position ever being posted to the public. Any organization-wide issues concerning race, gender, or sexual assault (and there are many) can be expected to be dismissed as \"toxic gossip\", or at the very least not understood, by them. \r\n\r\nThe CEO/founder rules out of fear with an iron fist, and he quickly snuffs out any whispers of dissent or organization by staff, using threats - ironically like the dictators that the organization prides itself on fighting against. He values perceived loyalty to him and the organization over actual work ethic or work produced, and prefers employees who stay quiet about highly inappropriate leadership and partner behavior. \r\n\r\nThe CEO/founder issued a major layoff in 2019, which has been followed by the hemorrhaging of many other core staff members as they quit before things have the chance to become even worse. It's a shame, considering some of the amazing activists whose work HRF could have supported if not for atrociously poor and inappropriate leadership.

The organization\u2019s finances have been in dire straits for more than five years and senior leadership often admits to \u201cborrowing from Peter to pay Paul\u201d - seeking more funding to pay for large debts incurred on previous events or programs that generate little support. Staff were often forced to put business expenses on their personal credit cards because the sole HRF credit card was repeatedly cut off or overdrawn. Some staff members aggregated debts of more than $20k with reimbursement slow to come. Donor support is highly skewed toward a few individuals, and many of the requirements for HRF\u2019s most significant grants are not diligently followed. \r\n\r\nThe treatment of women in the workplace has been discussed extensively in competing reviews on Glassdoor and I encourage those who read these reviews to appreciate that many of these employees with negative experiences worked directly with activists within the HRF network and voiced their concerns in addition to their own. Non-staff associated with the organization are still affected by its reputation and decisions to stand by offenders, and I personally know a number of individuals who feel uncomfortable with HRF\u2019s politics but feel that they cannot speak out against the organization because they rely on it for funding and support and fear retaliation.\r\n\r\nIt is also critical to recognize that HRF\u2019s holistic work environment encourages burnout and exhaustion, with threats often made to those who say they are struggling to maintain their workloads. Paranoia is endemic throughout the organization, much of this stemming from the CEO and senior leaders he has mentored, and an assumption that criticisms and questions about the organization and its structure are acts of sabotage or treason. For a considerable period of time, most employees at HRF were drawn from a pool of former interns or international consultants, with few coming to the organization with experience in other nonprofits or business organizations. This led to a culture of complacency within management and a disregard for new ideas. \r\n\r\nI was consistently threatened during my time at HRF for respectfully speaking up during meetings about decisions I felt would bankrupt the organization and personally watched countless employees break down on the job. Drug use, alcohol, and depression were rampant throughout the organization. Rather than demonize those who asked for help, HRF should strive to understand why its employees feel the need to self-medicate, particularly during stretches of time when staff are only sleeping 2-3 hours a night, rarely taking a weekend off, and often encouraged to work while on PTO. \r\n\r\nThere are countless stories to share that can demonstrate how HRF has manipulated its employees and created untenable work environments. However, HRF has a way of always skirting over its flaws and pretending that those who speak out and are removed for it are rare dissenters or employees with a grudge \u2014 which has happened every few years as if on a timed cycle. I would recommend for anyone considering working for HRF to reach out to some of those who no longer work at HRF and find out more about their experiences. It takes a long time to recover from the abuse and reputation of HRF, and I would hate for more individuals to go through the difficult process of realizing that an organization promising good work does not deliver on those promises, for either its community or staff."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Do you care about human rights?
