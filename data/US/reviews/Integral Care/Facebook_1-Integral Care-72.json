They can't keep prescribers, can't work out how to actually provide effective services to clients and change within the agency moves at a turtle's pace. Got really tired of spinning my wheels for years trying to implement change, burning myself out and being abused and used for it all. Also, if you are hired and decide you don't like your boss, you can't move positions for 6 months and managers routinely throw people under the bus who are looking at other positions in the agency so that the new manager is unlikely to hire them, due to the high turnover and massive amount of time and energy it takes to hire and train new staff.

The disrespect from management towards employees' boundaries regarding staying past end of shift was remarkable.

Management was routinely lacking in their ability to set example of the work ethic they demanded from staff. The punitive measures and utter lack of training by Team Lead and Program Manager is a poor example of leadership and will never be conducive to retaining qualified clinicians. To expect fairly new, unlicensed clinicians to provide training in the field is irresponsible.
