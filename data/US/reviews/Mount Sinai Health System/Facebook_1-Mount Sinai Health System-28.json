I would say 90% of them do the bare minimum of their responsibilities while 10% are trying their best to keep the IT department afloat. Managers know this and continue to burn out their high performers. Some people even consider this their \"second job\" since they are mostly responding emails/making phone calls for their side hustle. \r\n2. No clear vision for the future of Epic IT. This is why the IT content is so horribly built. They keep piecemealing modules slowly which leads to fragmented workflows that cause patient safety concerns. Big Bang Go-Live? Don\u2019t even mention that to the leadership here, they don\u2019t believe in doing things that make sense. \r\n3. Project Management office is a joke. Since they aren't invested in the success of a project, they don't contribute a lot. Often times, you will get pinged from them after a meeting to explain what was discussed and basically write meeting minutes for them. These people are essentially making 150k just to book meetings.\r\n4. Mount Sinai doesn't believe in raises. You either get promoted or stay with the same salary for the rest of your time there. I have spoken with other analysts at other NYC hospitals and they all have some sort of yearly raise system. If you do get promoted, the % increase is flat out repulsive and disrespectful. You will frequently find that external hires make significantly more than the folks who have stayed with the organization. \r\n5. IT leadership will not defend you against the wrath of delusional operational stakeholders. They will drive a bus over your body and reverse to kiss the behinds of arrogant misguided project sponsors. The ones that scream the loudest, often get what they want. Your priorities will shift constantly day to day. This might be true for a lot of organizations but you\u2019d be surprised how bad it is here. \r\n6. The environment is almost like a cult. Those who speak up against bad decisions / impossible timelines are viewed as troublemakers. They use key phrases like \u201csolution oriented\u201d or \u201cpositive attitude\u201d to mask the insanity that is happening. Think Theranos or Fyre Festival level of delusion. Someone on the team best described projects like a watermelon. People keep reporting Green to upper leadership but realistically it\u2019s Red. There is no accountability horizontally or vertically until there is a need for a scapegoat and it\u2019s you.\r\n7. Just like how Mount Sinai doesn\u2019t believe in investing in their employees, they don\u2019t invest in their technology either. You\u2019re left with using archaic laptops with frequent Citrix outages. Having worked at multiple hospitals prior to Mount Sinai, Epic is absurdly slow here."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor morale", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary and PTO are extremely competitive", "cons": "Toxic work environment, employees hate their job, understaffed, ancillary staff spend shift on their phone, yell and argue when you give them their assignment, d/t union almost impossible to fire anyone"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "growing too fast", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "opportunity to show leadership skills", "cons": "Departments are stretched too thin.
