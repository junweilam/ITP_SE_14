Then when they hired me, they reneged on a verbal commitment to reimburse me $2,500 for moving expenses, citing a \"change in  policy\" (during the protracted onboarding process).  I hemorrhaged a lot of cash due to these factors.  Then they let me go after 3.5 months simply because a new doctor they on-boarded 2 days after me thought a former associate (who was also a good friend, AKA crony) would be better in my position. (Both the new doctor and his friend were over 70 years old and came out of retirement to join Sinai).  I had just signed a lease!  The doctors couldn't even deliver the news personally.  They had HR do it.  And citing policy again, because the termination occurred during the probationary period, they could not make themselves available to me for a reference. I thought the timing of the termination was a bit suspicious but then I learned they fired me 3 days before I qualified for unemployment benefits.  They were in the middle of a hiring binge and had hired about 100 new staff a week for the past year, so I suspect this is a racket where Sinai casually hires a lot of people and uses their probationary mechanism to let many of them go and just before they qualify for unemployment. (This way Sinai avoids increases in their unemployment insurance rate).  So I was happy I left with some of the documents I was working on or else I'd have nothing to show for my time there, but then I began receiving threatening emails from the Chief Counsel at the behest of the doctors and the Compliance officers, claiming Sinai and only Sinai are the rightful owners of anything I produced there.  The threats included the New York State police and the Department of Justice.  (If you so a web search on Sinai legal activities, you'll find evidence that they like to resort to aggressive scorched-earth tactics.  Fortunately Judge Bermann did not allow them to use such tactics to quash a qui tam whistle-blower lawsuit that has been filed against them on behalf of staff claiming the hospital is engaged in Medicare fraud).  If that weren't enough, they neglected to send me my W-2.  And while I was there, they never gave me a dedicated workstation.  No office.  No cube.  They eventually got me an inadequate laptop (though I had no place to sit with it except the floor) and no means to print documents.  They let me use one of the primitive PCs that are reserved for monitors, and they kicked me off the PC whenever a monitor needed it.  The administrator in charge of delegating these resources yelled at me during our introductory meeting, claiming the doctors who hired me never informed her I was in their plans.  I was told that for that reason, I would never be given a proper workstation. \r\n\r\nThe hospital is very invasive and sanctimonious.  They expect nothing but excellence from their employees, which is astonishing considering all the substandard work I witnessed while I was there.  And the hospital is always threatening to invade your bloodstream.  The pre-employment drug screen was not enough.  They like to herd employees into what they call the 8-hour annual health assessment, a comprehensive physical.  And you never know exactly when it's coming.  They also like to taut their policy of random drug testing.  And based on the EPIC data dumps I reviewed, they're always drug testing their cancer patients."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Rampart Nepotism", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Clinical Research Intern in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong academic prestige that facilitates learning opportunities.", "cons": "Nepotism played a huge part in whom learned certain things and whom did not.

As a professional Medical Records Coder I was more than excited to start my new job there.  Unfortunately from day one I experienced the worst possible treatment and total lack of respect from the team of managers who just the week before was so thrilled to \"welcome me on board.\"  The supervisor who I had to report directly had no formal ICD-9 or CPT training or credentials whatsoever.  Coders and staff could not go to her for any questions on actual coding issues, yet they HAD to.  The big \"rule\" of the department was that no coding communication of any sort was allowed between CRMs and staff without her explicit approval on a case by case basis. Imagine this in a busy coding office! This was the biggest frustration I had to deal with.   Twice I found myself called into the office for having an \"improper communication with a coder.\"  By the second week of employment I had enough and moved on elsewhere to a much more open, professional, and rewarding job at a much less prestigious hospital.\r\nThe coding managers at Mount Sinai are, unfortunately, very much dedicated to micro-managing and controlling the behavior of its staff and in the process, completely demeaning and demoralizing them terribly.  They focus on so many rules, and processes, and functions, and forming graphs and charts and holding countless, wasteful meetings where nothing productive is ever accomplished.  It is unfortunate because the case mix at this hospital is an amazing challenge and training tool for any coder. It would be a great place to work if it wasn't for this very dysfunctional group of control freaks who are in charge.  The coding staff -- who are union, probably the only reason they stay -- deserve great kudos for what they have to put up with and for doing such good work.  If anything gets done in this department it is because the coding staff lives up to some very arbitrary rules and impossible standards.
