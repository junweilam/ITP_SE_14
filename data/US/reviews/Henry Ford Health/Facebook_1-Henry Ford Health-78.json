Innovation in practice is discouraged and individual accomplishments are simply not recognized. When exceptional work is done, the system will take credit. I watched senior management and Department Chairs steal the ideas and research results of clinicians, putting their own names on those ideas and claiming them as their own. Several years ago HFHS began promoting itself as a \"innovative workplace\" and hired an \"innovations team\" to lead management's efforts to promote this.
