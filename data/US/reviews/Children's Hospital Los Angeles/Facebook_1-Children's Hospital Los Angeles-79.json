I'm talking $6-10 less an hour compared to other area hospitals. And that's excluding the hospitals like UCLA and Kaiser that have above-average pay.

When you have three different managers and one is great while two are awful, expect nothing of note to get accomplished. Maybe it's like this anywhere, but many of my co-workers are in a constant state of complaint about managers, meager salaries, and the TERRIBLE traffic.

Your co-workers will also support you. Everyone believes in the mission here, and generally looks out for each other.  Morale is typically high and people are kind and accepting towards each other. \r\n\r\nWe also get breaks here, don't let anyone tell you otherwise! More than one, too ;)\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of \"extra\" things to get involved in (councils and committees, audits, research, etc.), and there are a lot of ways the hospital tries to make nurses feel cared for and heard (HR night rounds, occasional face to face meetings with the CNO or CEO, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe night shift differential is good, $4.75 for 1st 4 hours and $8 for the last 8. That comes out to around $7/hour overall, close to $1000/month.", "cons": "Those \"extra\" things are an expectation to receive raises that are still less than the average rate of inflation. New RNs get brought up to speed in terms of pay fairly quickly but after a few years you're looking at a around 1.5% yearly increase if you work your butt off on the \"extras\", and less than 1% if you don't get involved much off of the floor. You will always be told you're \"above market\" after 3 or 4 years of experience and will not get raises with market adjustments.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are marginal. They do match your 401k contributions at 3% after a year, regardless of your status (full time, per diem, etc.). But health insurance is pretty blah. My husband's offerings through work are better and cheaper even at his part time status versus my full time. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you're part time here (less than 0.75 FTE for the sake of benefits), be prepared for your health insurance premiums to be nearly double the full time rate. There is also no way to waive your benefits and take a slightly higher pay rate, so don't ask. LA is expensive, and many nurses here work a second job or pick up extra shifts beyond being full time to be able to afford it.\r\n\r\nAside from the expectations of much  involvement beyond the \"floor\" for any RN, there is unfortunately not much of a clinical ladder. The desirable roles (lead RNs, managers, house supervisors, directors) are filled by people that do not tend to leave for decades. So for job growth, if that's your thing, RNs tend to go back to school and become NPs, teach, or find positions elsewhere. Not much room on the ladder here. They'll be happy for you to take on more work in councils, etc. but it won't likely earn you any promotions because everybody is in the same boat."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "CHLA", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2015", "job_title": " in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "CHLA reputation as being a leader in pediatric medicine.
