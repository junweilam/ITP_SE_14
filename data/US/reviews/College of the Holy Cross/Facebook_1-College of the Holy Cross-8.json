Some depts are led by tyrants or worse and others depts are not. Religion/theology is not a good department to work in especially for people of color. Senior faculty in that dept. simply have a different set of standards for minority scholars. (For instance, they have never tenured an American minority scholar--i.e., African American, Mexican American, or Native American in the department's over 100 years of existence. They do actively recruit immigrant and liberal Protestant scholars, however. They just have an issue with so-called colonized minorities.) \nAlso, the dept likes to run afoul of the local Catholic Bishop due to faux woke Protestant (not Catholic) liberation theology. If you are an European Catholic with a doctorate from a Catholic school, you are golden. It will be a good dept for you. If you aren't, don't waste your time applying.
