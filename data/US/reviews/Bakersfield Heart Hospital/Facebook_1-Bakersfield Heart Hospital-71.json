ER staff is definitely victims of this. Staff is overheard constantly about patients issues and staff is picked on by upper management. Old outdated equipment, low pay and the drive to pull \"the boat around\" by selling to whoever is willing to buy the hospital they are willing to throw their employees under the bus because they're so desperate to keep from going under. They ran off several great doctors due to their backward mentality of appeasing their new partners and get loans to get new equipment to make doctors want to do surgery there and bring their business there but departments would suffer for it. It was conveyed that the staff would be taken care but the patient was always first but the real feel was that money was being wasted and spent frivously to appear up to date. It's a smoke screen.
