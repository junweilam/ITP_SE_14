This employee is now doing the exact same thing on that shift! He is a great politician who sweet talks people in high positions and they buy into all his lies! He loves to brag about the people he knows in high places and how that\u2019s how he\u2019s been able to do what he wants when he wants. He even lets his favorite employees hang out in his office and slack off while he gets other employees to pick up the slack. Human Resources has let him get away with this for years.  An employee in a high position from this hospital is so fake.  Many staff members have stated they have said hello to this person and the person will look you straight in the eye and won\u2019t respond or acknowledge you. This employee is suppose to set an example! Nurses treat evs workers like the lowest of low. They expect them to do everything and won\u2019t even say hello or give you a simple thank you for helping them out at times. Cafeteria workers, floor workers and evs all get treated this way by nurses, doctors and even some pharmacy employees. We work just as hard if not more than they do to be treated as if we are lower than dirt.  Going to Human Resources about an employee is pointless because that person just gets moved to a different position.  People in higher places will say they will work on it or fix it, but things don\u2019t change."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Summerlin Rn", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Staff RN II in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Standard hospital politics like anywhere.
