One of the trees had drooping branches that were brittle; it was clear that it had been dead for some time.\r\n* Mildew smell in my building that is persistent.\r\n* Lack of cleaning. Mildew and other dark stains on the restrooms walls. Unidentifiable crusting around the faucets from a lack of cleaning.\r\n* Unworkable water fountains that either project too far or feature HOT water.\r\n* Rusty light posts. Broken curbs. Poor pavement.\r\n\r\nLet's move onto the university as a whole. The last president, who just resigned, dropped the graduation rate from ~40% to 14% in her tenure. There have been enrollment drops as a result. Retention is extremely low. There have been major job cuts. Many positions remain unfilled as no one who is qualified would even begin to work at a place with such an uncertain future.\r\n\r\nSome coworkers berate other employees and faculty, calling them incompetent, stupid and other unprofessional terms on an almost daily basis. Others are disgruntled due to lack of promotions and pay raises.
