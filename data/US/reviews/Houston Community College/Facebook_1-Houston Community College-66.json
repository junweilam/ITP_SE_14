I've never experienced a better work-life balance which has been key with grade school aged kids at home. Students mainly want to take their classes online, so most(but not all) of the work is remote/work from home. Benefits are solid. So while the pay is barely sufficient, it at least pays more than most grade-school/ISD based teaching positions. If you like being a pivotal influence and mentor to others, then it's hard to find a more direct position. You form relationships with students for life and get to celebrate their successes along the way. Regarding the interactions with students, this is the most rewarding job I have ever held.", "cons": "Historically, lowest pay among peer institutions such as Lonestar College. Don't make the mistake of thinking your only job as an instructor is to teach your classes to the best of your ability. Enrollment rules the world for higher academia. Ironically, more emphasis is put on students' physical attendance in campus classrooms, rather than general enrollment (whether online or in-person) in a program. Key performance indicators for each program of study are dictated by the President of the campus the program is assigned to which means if your program is unlucky and gets assigned to an East Houston based campus, your are screwed, because the geographical mid-point of Houston's population is actually located at Westheimer and Beltway 8. It's obvious students want to take classes online or closest to their homes. Huge emphasis is put on educating HISD dual-credit students, but the highest enrollment of dual-credit is actually with Alief ISD. Teamwork between service departments such as Student Success and Degree programs does not exist, so get ready to be blamed for other people not doing their job or for other departments being understaffed. Unfortunately, administration does not seem to acknowledge the high employee turnover as an indicator of this disfunction, unrealistic KPIs, and lack of ownership by administrations / service departments. We are getting a new Chancellor soon though, so there may be hope for real change to be made in the future."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "NA", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Senior Benefits Specialist in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cannot give a adequate review, wasn't there long enough.
