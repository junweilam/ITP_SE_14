Administrators making fat 6 figure salaries that don't want to make difficult decisions because they do not want to upset anyone.  Leadership tends not to be around either.  It became common towards the end of my time there for staff to complain that administrators can never be found.  Lack of leadership and leadership presence leaves people feeling uneasy, uncared for and demoralized.  These are the exact symptoms staff exhibited when I eventually decided to leave Pima.
