HR has total and complete control over pay scales and are secretive about their compensation research process, only recently have they given any credit for past experience, yet they still only account for in system experience not outside the org or education/internships. Promotions are arbitrary and the time it takes to advance completely depends on the manager. Recent reorg complicates matters further and deeply segregates teams and has reduced collaboration between groups and has decimated the traditional model of separate teams for each module and tried to push all analysts towards be generalists. You will likely not get certified if not already, proficiencies only here, they don\u2019t like to pay for it unless you are a design analyst, those doing all the troubleshooting and maintenance are not treated well. A new restructure on the horizon has many people on edge. Half the team has quit and moved on over the last year and half. Insurance costs more yearly with reduced benefits, and you only have the option of Samaritan plans.
