Parking is partially paid for but the employee does pay for parking.  There isn't any room in the close ramps for new employees - they have to get on a waiting list for a closer ramp and park in one that isn't even on the U campus over a mile away and either walk or take a shuttle.  The upper management here seems to have no idea what is actually going on in the clinics, in my opinion.  There are so many \"big picture\" things they seem to work on that aren't relevant to the certain smaller clinics.  Our managers are in CONSTANT meetings and really don't have much of a presence in the actual clinics.  There is a lot of waste via purchasing equipment that is not wanted/needed and then on the flip side not purchasing things we do need.  For a university setting I would appreciate better equipment to work with - our topographers are a complete joke.  I don't know how we run a cornea clinic with the equipment we have.  Our wait times in the clinic are absolutely horrendous due to the ratio of staff-patients.  We charge a lot of money for eye examinations and our pay doesn't reflect that.  The benefits are decent but not nearly in line with places like Health Partners, Park Nicollet, Allina, Fairview, etc.  Those places all pay way more for ophthalmic technicians as well.
