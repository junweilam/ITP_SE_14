Great for building some great relationships.", "cons": "* No vision for dept. and called in consultants to help shape units vision. \r\n\r\n* Lack of understanding of latest technologies and the school is well behind other universities in serving its students. For, example students made a youtube video rap complaining about how slow the schools network is. No student workers in IT to assist in development. The IT department has no identity and students don't know it's purpose or value to the university. This is especially demoralizing to a web developer as one of its main purpose is to portray that identity to stakeholders. \r\n\r\n* Power struggles and politics. The IT department and Web team are separate. The web team is under communications dept. The spelman main website is the worst site I have ever seen for a prestigious university. Note this is NOT due to employees but, leadership and lack vision. Leadership is too busy cat fighting to realize that the student who pay their salary see them as incompetent. So please note that the web developer in MIT will always be at odds with web developers in communications. You will frequently get emails from communications leadership challenging you and calling for meetings.\r\n\r\n* No development or service oriented methodologies in place. The ticketing system was great but, useless as the rules IT had in place were not adhered to. One call or email to leadership and IT staff had to drop everything to meet that need no matter its importance. \r\n\r\n* Project management is non existent. I managed my own projects and we had no one to go to bat for us when staff asked for non production or non emergency changes.\r\n\r\n* A lot of work for little pay.\r\n\r\nBottom line is if you are a seasoned web developer this is not the place for you as no one in leadership understands the importance of the web or social media. I definitely would not recomend this position to a young developer due to zero training and politics. \r\n\r\nI choose to move on for a better challenge and a better fit.\r\n\r\nInside tips:\r\n\r\n1. They lowered the salary for this position after I left.\r\n2. You will be one of only 3 real object oriented programmers at the university. Stay hidden.\r\n3. If you have Java/J2EE fundamentals don't waist your time. \r\n4. The position asks for 5 years of exp. If you are a seasoned web developer you are wasting your time at the new lowered salary."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not a lot of organization and cohesion across campus", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are generally nice, easy-going, and supportive", "cons": "A lot of disorganization and confusion about the work that connects across campus; different departments aren't clued into how their work impacts and depends on work happening across campus."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "If you're young, DO NOT waste your years here.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Free gym. \r\n-Free shuttle from West End Marta Station. \r\n-Paid holiday vacation for Christmas Break. \r\n-Nice work life balance", "cons": "- If you don't have children, their major benefit of free education is useless. \r\n-No room for growth because people stay in their positions for YEARS. \r\n-Stuck in the old ways of doing things.
