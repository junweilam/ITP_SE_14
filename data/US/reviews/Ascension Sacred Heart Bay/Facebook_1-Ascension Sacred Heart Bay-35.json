Then they laid off 800+ employees via text/email (all getting the same letter) then posted new job openings on their website. Very poor communication throughout it all. So many were away from their families during the hurricane and negating their own needs outside of the hospital to help with patients can keep the hospital running only for the hospital to turn around and say, \"thank you for being there for us but we're laying you and most everyone else off.
