The leadership team are ineffectual, duplicitous, political, and wildly dismissive of the staff. They practice favoritism, bully middle management and front line staff, and seem to be utterly directionless. \n\nThe only thing that may be worse than the leadership team is the product itself. The edX platform is really buggy and frustrating. If you don't speak English, your options for learning are extremely limited. Getting a certificate is only made challenging by hurdles in the software, not necessarily the course material. \n\nThe course quality is lacking as well. edX has no formal process for ensuring the quality of the courses the partners publish. This results in typos on just about every page, quizzes being graded incorrectly, and complete failures of proctoring software. \n\nNobody in leadership has any real interest in fixing these problems (and those mentioned certainly aren't the only ones). 2U bought edX for it's user base so they could market their online degree to a large group of learners that are used to online learning. I think the modest revenue edX brings in is also appealing to 2U, but it's not really enough to warrant a lot of investment by the company. \n\nThat's the main problem. edX just feels like it has no future.

I believe the senior management was responding to pressure from the board, but the outcome was that there was constant discussion about \"sustainability\", which is an unnecessary euphemism for \"profit\". The executive management believed that the employees wouldn't tolerate working on things that would make edX make money. I don't know if that was true about anyone (it wasn't true about me), but the real problem is how they dealt with it: they *lied*.\r\n\r\nedX's mission is to \"increase access to high-quality education for everyone, everywhere\", but employees at edX aren't allowed to work on projects that would increase access for people that have slow or unreliable internet connections. We were constantly pushed to work on projects at the behest of large corporate or government donors.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the employees aren't valued and the organization is inefficient and misdirected. When employees reported dissatisfaction with their jobs in a review last year, the management responded in an unbelievably corporate way: they created a committee.\r\n\r\nThe committee reported its findings to Wendy Cebula (the COO and President). When she was told that employees felt that employee retention was not a priority to executive management she said, \"they're right. When someone leaves edX, I see it as an opportunity to get an A-player in here.\"\r\n\r\nThe tragedy is that many of edX's employees are talented people who really do care about the stated mission and have made personal sacrifices to be there. My sincerest wish is that the organization is put under more sincere management and edX can have the impact that we hope for.\r\n\r\nIf you (as edX's president) feel that you have to hit some deadline for a donor, how about just saying that instead of couching it in a fantasy about helping the world by starting with the people that (frankly) don't really need the help?"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Mixed bag", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Partner Manager in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great colleagues & mission, Market rate pay at a non-profit which can be hard to find, Fantastic benefits from MIT", "cons": "Management is very self-focused and does not give much thought to their  employees' career path and satisfaction except in relation to how good their employees make them look and for progressing their management careers, Long hours and continually squeezing of employees to take on more work despite lack of work-life balance, Rampant favoritism in promotion process instead of merit-based"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Fun place, meaningful work, in growth mode", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- The people are engaged and learner focused, this means a lot of the typical work place drama doesnt apply\r\n- We're changing the way higher ed works...so people can actually afford to get an education.
