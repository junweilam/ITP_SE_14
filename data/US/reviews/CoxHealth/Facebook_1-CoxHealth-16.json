As a result, what they say you are working and getting paid for is a false narrative. You might be hired to work 80 hours a pay period, but if you are low censused (meaning you don't work because the hospital doesn't have enough patients), you either use your vacation time (earned) to fill the gap or you don't get paid.

Works great for the hospital, not so great when you have bills to pay. \r\n4) Holidays: you either get time and a half for the 6 major holidays or you take the day off...that would be without pay or use your vacation pay. in other words, there are NO Paid Holidays.\r\nEarned Time Off: pretty limited the first few years...you get less than 3 weeks a year as an RN..well below the national average. \r\nIn summary: the hospital's pay and benefits are well below the national average."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Below Average Wages", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Emergency Department RN in Springfield, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great facility to get top notch training.

Patient care is only third to making money and paying administrations salaries. \r\n\r\n While you may be scheduled for 36 hours, you might only end up with 32 or less by the end of the week depending on weather they force you to stay home.
