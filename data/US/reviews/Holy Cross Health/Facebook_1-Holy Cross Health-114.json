The nurses who are waiting for Transport Services to pick the patient up often then call Transport Department or a manager to complain that transport hasn't yet picked up their patient, when in all actuality the transporter is most likely busy with their previous call and not able to get to it yet. I myself have been victim of this time and time again.
