The best part was the mission to save lives through donation. The non-compensation related benefits were pretty good too. Like the health insurance and the paid time off. Cheryl and Kathy were super nice and always friendly.", "cons": "There are plenty of cons but ill just speak vaguely because I dont want to hurt the company's reputation even if there is even a miniscule amount of it harming their ability to get the families to say yes to donation. So I will go easy on them AND I will say that this is a good place to work and the families are in good hands with LOPA. That being said... The company is very rigid in their nonsensical processes. Their willingness to change for the better is typically impeded by their chain of command and good ideas are not easy to circulate. There were always a lot of naysayers here and when you bring them an idea, they think you are either delusional or have ulterior motives. They are not dynamic in changing for efficiency, instead they will become more and more inefficient and add non-value tasks in order to prove to the rest of the company that they are pro-donation. Basically, instead of taking a helicopter ride to the top of Mt. Washington, they will opt to not only walk it, but to crawl the whole way just so that more people can see that they are on a trip to hike mount Washington. Only problem is they will never make it anywhere near the mountain. What im saying is that they fail to see the big picture; which is the truth that a smoothly run, efficient, dynamic company with low turnover is in and of itself pro-donation and will benefit the donors. Its essentially short sighted and rigid where it should be dynamic and dynamic in areas where changes have minimal effect. That's why it was nonsensical. If you're in a smaller role there is very little wiggle room to help the company in a big way because you will get squished down by the superiors. Someone at the bottom can paint them a Mona Lisa and they will choose the macaroni art because it was painted by someone who can bulldoze through others in a social setting. You wont find a harder place to give someone a million dollar idea. They will tend to think \"By giving us an idea, you're implying that there is a problem of how we currently do things\" and you might insult people along the way. Despite their problems, I would still recommend to work here (as you can see I gave it 4 stars). FYI Tissue Family Advocate was by far the worst job at LOPA and that's going to be hard to hear if anyone at LOPA reads this but deep down they know its true. Also, if anyone is reading this and thinking about applying, just know its a small company and they are still learning, people retire, and companies change."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "A learning experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 May 2022", "job_title": "Family Advocate in Shreveport, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Pay \nGreat Health Insurance", "cons": "Not inclusive\nUpper management has a very my way or the highway mindset"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great employer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Advocate in Covington, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Innovation, flexibility, authentic, caring, giving", "cons": "pay, career advancement, upper movement, inward movement, holiday work"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Organ Recovery Coordinator in New Orleans, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Impactful work - making a difference", "cons": "Long hours can lead to burnout"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Lopa", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Family Advocate in Shreveport, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Call days are nice and you don't have to work in a office setting 5 days a week.", "cons": "Advancement is limited and depends on whom you are friends with"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "CSC", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 May 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Lafayette, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work environment is positive and encouraging.
