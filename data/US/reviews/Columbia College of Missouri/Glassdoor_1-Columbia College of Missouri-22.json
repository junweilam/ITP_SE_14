Another Con would be the low pay compared to the industry as a whole. Some positions are still considered low skilled because the positions have not been updated, yet these positions have been given greater and greater responsibilities managing systems. Some positions have not received a raise in 5 years while other positions have seen raises year after years. (Usually those people in positions that are in favor with the CIO.) Comments by the CIO regarding pay increases have had the following responses given as to why a raise was not merited \"You have a spouse that works. You don't need a raise.\" Yearly evaluations are used as a punishment instead of a feedback. The CIO will add comments to evaluations that he himself as not discussed with staff individually all year. At that point little recourse can be taken to refute the comments.
