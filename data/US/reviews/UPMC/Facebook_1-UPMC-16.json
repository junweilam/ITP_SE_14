Your shortcomings will be noted in your performance review; there is always at least one shortcoming that can be recalled for inclusion there. Concerns (well, concerns of a certain kind) move up the chain of command quickly - each level of management wants to avoid negative PR, no matter how petty the issue, and feels the need to report to *their* supervisor before making many decisions.

I kid you not. \r\n\r\nThe job of Service Coordinator (mental health) itself, apart from the general UPMC environment, is about the same as one would expect it to be anywhere...lots of petering calls and demands from people on SSI asking you do things for them.

You're constantly being berated by both the patients and the doctors offices who you must reach out to even though these offices are under UPMC as well. It doesn't seem like anybody cares about how you feel. They encourage you to report employees in the doctors office who are rude to you, however, nothing happens to these employees and they are rude the next time you call.

Because of how UPMC came together, you will find a wide variety of corporate cultures and practices within this healthcare system. UPMC has allowed at least some of these acquired businesses to retain their original policies and procedures. While the tide is slowly changing with UPMC's desire to have a unified corporate culture, depending on where an employee ends up within the system, they could have an extremely different company experience and be required to follow different policies and procedures. This can be both a good or bad thing depending on where you work. \r\n\r\nThe best thing is a lot of different jobs you can transfer into and after you have been at UPMC a year, you can transfer into a new role every six months and do not need manager permission to do so.", "cons": "I held several roles during my time at UPMC, but wanted to speak specifically to their centralized talent acquisition/recruitment function, which they call \"TA\" for short.  I was a recruiter during my time in TA and have concerns about the way the overall recruitment process was managed. \r\n\r\nWhile the recruiters had overall guidelines and \"scripts\" to use at various stages of the process, not all recruiters followed them. For example, even for professional, salaried positions, some recruiters did not feel it necessary to provide a benefits overview to the final candidate being made the offer. Since UPMC salaries very much reflect their non-profit status, the benefits package is an important selling point as part of the offer. I could not understand why the TA team leads and managers did not guide all recruiters to follow a consistent standard when making an offer to a candidate. Besides creating an inconsistent candidate experience, it also caused the recruiters who did follow the process of outlining the benefits in the offer to take a lot more time doing the offer (as they should), which caused them to get behind on other day to day recruitment tasks, like routing candidates onto hiring managers and posting new job openings. \r\n\r\nWhile my requisition load was a bit lower than my team members, because I was doing the outline of the benefits during the job offer, I often had to come in early or stay late to keep up with these other tasks. I was also the one my team lead frequently signaled out to pick up extra work if another team member left or was on vacation. It was frustrating because it's an open office environment and I know my team lead could hear me making offers and my other team members making offers and the difference in what we were saying to the candidate. My team lead seemed to play favorites and if she liked you, you weren't required to follow the overall department policy of how an offer should be handled. This is not fair to the candidates and ultimately the patients because it's important to attract the right people into these roles. \r\n\r\nAnother big point of concern was the senior management of TA's focus on the number of offers we closed each week. Per team, we had a goal we were required to meet each week. While we were not commission-based, there was quite a lot of pressure from our team leads to make this goal and work into the weekend to meet it. I had one outstanding offer that I would not have been able to wrap up on a Saturday morning, due to a prior personal commitment. I alerted my team lead to my limited availabity during this one particular Saturday, and instead of letting the offer slide into the new week or asking another team member to help out, I was flat out told to pressure the candidate into accepting the offer on Friday afternoon. As an HR professional with 10 years of experience prior to taking this role, I was shocked that this was my team lead's solution to this particular challenge. I don't think it's ever a good idea or acceptable to pressure a candidate into a quick answer to a job offer. All this does is make them resentful of the recruitment process and possibly the company. Plus, there's nothing stopping the candidate from later rescinding their acceptance. \r\n\r\nWhile yes, as recruiters, we don't want to have job openings lingering for a long time since that hurts the business and the patient experience, we also shouldn't be pressured to fill the job with the next available warm body. Most of these jobs involve direct patient care and it's so important to find the right kind of compassionate, caring person to fill the role. The company's reputation ultimately rests on the quality of patient care.\r\n\r\nThe goal seemed to be on TA to keep filling the openings (some of which were high turnover)and focus instead of examining why there was high turnover to begin with.  Some causes I've seen for turnover have been low pay, mean managers, long hours and poor working conditions.  If these underlying issues are not fully addressed in the company culture, TA will continue to keep spinning its wheels to fill and re-fill the same openings.\r\n\r\nThe typical TA employee is extremely young and rather inexperienced (hence the reason my twentysomething team lead thought asking me to pressure a candidate was OK), including its senior leaders, who are early to mid-40's at best. Having very few employees with significant and seasoned HR experience makes for a TA culture that has a limited view of how things should be done and ways to improve current processes. \r\n\r\nBoth during and after my time in TA, I witnessed team leads and managers having a lack of comfort when a process improvement was brought to their attention. Instead of actively listening and considering the pain points their customers were having, they spent a lot of time and energy defending why they were doing things the way they were. Those that will do well in TA will need to be extremely passionate not only about recruitment in general, but also with of TA's policies and procedures. They are looking for \"Yes\" men/women and not change agents within this department. \r\n\r\nI often felt like I was a cog in the TA recruitment wheel, with a continual cycle of posting jobs, routing candidates to managers and making offers. There is very little variety in the work and the average number of openings per recruiter was around 70-80 requisitions."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work, great people", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Senior Recruiter in Pittsburgh, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed my time with CHP.

The building opened in 1938 and retains much of the same amenities that it had back then; windows that leak air like a sieve, couple of electrical outlets per room (electricity was new back in 1938), one dim overhead light and a few critters scouring about.  Most of the patients' rooms are semi-private and extremely small, and one could possibly reach across the gap between the beds and touch their roommate.  Good luck to those escorts who have the dubious task of transporting the patients via the elevators.  They are also tiny. I guess people and beds were smaller back then.  Forget the idea of moving someone if you have a bariatric bed.  As for the HVAC, yeah, pretty much nonexistent.  Some rooms are molten hot while others are harboring the polar vortex.  But this can be explained...thermostats!  Yes, it's a device that controls temperature.  This leads to housekeeping...Laurel Cavern is probably cleaner and more well lit.  Not really housekeeping's fault because there are so darn few of them.  The manager to housekeeping ratio is probably 10 to 1.  It takes no less than 3 managers to supervise one housekeeper.  This leads to the management.  Can't figure out where their heads are at.  They spend millions opening a nursing unit in the old Children's Hospital Tower and now, are going to close it down 2 years later.  The plan I'm told is that there are \"plans\" for a new hospital.  I sure hope so but I'm not counting on it.  They hit me up 15 years ago to buy an engraved brick for the Presby Tower.  Still waiting on that one.  Hey, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  But to management's defense, most haven't a clue because they haven't been properly vetted.  They are either someone's idiot brother-in-law or sister-in-law or just don't have the credentials and are waiting on that generous tuition plan.  So, to sum this up: you'll be working in a very old antiquated building with management that could care less about patient care.  All that's important is the bottom line.
