You could say to your supervisor \"Hey Jim there is literally an adult alligator in the bathroom.\" and Jim will literally say \"Well back in the 80s we didn't have alligators, or bathrooms! So just ignore your life outside of work and you'll do great.\" Corporation is expanding but not growing the existing teams who support the increasing workloads, underappreciative of essential employees in food/cleaning/support roles who provide for everyone else in the enterprise. Leadership spends years starting to think about maybe making improvements to the biggest challenges and issues for the enterprise on things they should have planned for 10 years ago, then hire outside consultants rather than use the complaints & suggestions of thousands of knowledgeable current employees to gain any insight... Both old and new CEOs just want to get their picture next to as many news articles as possible, no matter how superficial the content is, almost all of which they had no involvement in/knowledge of until someone whose fulltime job is to write one half-page, large print, magazine article per month has finished the article. Real-estate and building space management teams literally give themselves multiple renovated private offices and stack other teams in literal walk-in closets. Corporate leadership teams weirdly single out and groom certain female interns for special treatment and creation of new pre-selected, laid-back corporate positions. Administrative leaders unconsciously show off their (paid-for by non-profit) unethically luxurious home offices while remotely showing up for Mon-Weds meetings (they don't work often Thursdays and Fridays) Majority of capable employees have no trust or confidence in leadership, but will say they do when the company asks of course, in fear of their job security. Company throws away mega millions in working modern equipment annually, and keeps what they should throw away when it comes to software and policies/practices. Due to overworked/ poor choices in central IT design, the company wastes many dozens of millions annually on paid time doctors are sitting in front of patients waiting for the computers to load up, many of my doctors know and complain about this.
