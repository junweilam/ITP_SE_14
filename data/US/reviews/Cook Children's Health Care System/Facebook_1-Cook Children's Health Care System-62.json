In my experience, there was no such as an open-door policy. Certain departments are very political which makes for toxic situations. In extreme scenarios, leadership is often unwilling to confront these issues through HR for two reasons: HR is not considered effective because they have failed to appropriately handle past situations, and these situations often stem from the managers' own lack of leadership or toxic behavior. Even when teams have extremely high turnover, it is unheard of for HR to intervene or make inquiries about the situation. For a young professional, there are few opportunities for growth within the system. The reason for this appears to be twofold: longtime employees are hesitant to leave, and ageism. I witnessed several young, female employees leave their positions because they were simply burnt out from the emotional labor they were expected to perform daily. They were scrutinized for their appearances (especially their dress) and demeanors and faced bullying from senior female employees.

It's a hot mess. They do talk a good game though. You'll be SOLD during orientation. You'll feel proud of working there. Slowly you'll see the unraveling of their propaganda machine and become jaded. It has happened to everyone I know who have worked there, myself included. \r\n\r\n If you are okay being a drone worker bee and taking orders that make no sense, going to meetings in an echo chamber, then this place is for you.  If you like feeling like you belong to a dysfunctional family that love to be inside your brain at all times, then this place is for you.  \r\n\r\nIf you like working around a bunch of country bumpkins who are afraid of Muslims and poor people, then this place is for you.  If you want to sit around and talk about your baby and husband instead of doing your job, then this place is definitely for you. If you watch mainstream reality TV shows and think that it matters then apply for the  child life department. It's brimming with idiots who have no idea what is happening in the world around them.  \r\n\r\nThe parking garage you will  be forced to park in is like playing the game of Risk every morning. There are tons of employee driven events that you can be a part of if you are one of the lucky \"cool people\" who are invited to participate.  \r\nIf you are trying to be a child life specialist because you want to help children, that is great and noble of you but you will not find that at Cook Childrens. Some of the specialist are great, but you won't see them because they are doing their job and everyone else's job. If you are male and reading this, then count yourself out of the race right now. You will never be hired at this company for the child life department. It is clearly a female only club, trust me on this."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Friendly people, adorable patients, and rewarding work environment.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "25 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Unit Secretary in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This hospital system values their employees which creates positive morale and a team driven environment.

One of the best reasons I enjoy being employed by CCMC is the comraderie among employees. I work in the ED, so it may be different on other floors, but the staff in our unit gets along extremely well. I can not think of one person I do not enjoy working with, and I have never been able to say that about any job I have ever had. Upper level management is visible and accessible, however not to the point of smothering the employee, or appearing to \"watch over one's shoulder.\" Typically no more than about ten days pass between when someone from administration will ask me if I have all of the resources I need to do my job, if there are any process improvements I think could be made. The final question they always ask is how I am PERSONALLY doing. That is a pretty impressive and important question in my opinion, and one that is rarely asked by the administration in other healthcare facilities I have worked at. Being that we see a fair amount of sad cases come through the ED, not all of which have a positive outcome, it is easy to get beaten down sometimes. It is nice to know management and administration care. I have also see many of the suggestions that have been given to management put into action, so it makes the staff feel good that they are not only being heard, but actually being \"listened\" too. The hospital also gives out gifts almost every quarter for nurses appreciation week, staff birthdays etc. Last year all full time staff got a $500.00 Wal Mart gift card, and part timers got a $250.00 card. The cards were given for no reason other than that the administration really appreciated our hard work and dedication, it was as simple as that. I thought that was really amazing.\r\n\r\nThe administration has a \"blameless\" environment attitude towards near misses and other occurrences. This means that unless you were grossly negligent, the hospital will try to fix the reason that the mistake was made, not necessarily punish the person that made it. It also encourages staff to speak up about near misses so process improvements can be made and implemented. \r\n\r\nIt is easy to find cliquish groups, especially in the healthcare setting. This is not the case at CCMC. Everyone works together and management promotes a \"It's all about the kids\" approach to patient centered care and environment. This goes a long way to keep the staff \"job focused\" and conflict free.", "cons": "The only downside as of late has been staffing shortages. This is not problem specific to this hospital either, it is nationwide. Management has been trying very creative ways to recruit new staff and retain them, so it is clear that they see the problem and are responding to it. The issue isn't retention so much, but it is the fact that the hospital is growing to keep pace with the size of the community, and they can't seem to find staff fast enough to keep pace. It has been getting better however, and they are still working on the permanent solution."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Excellent employer until your individuality clashes with someone's pride and ego.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Aug 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Knowing that you are part of an organization that is REALLY the best place for a sick child to go.

They are so insecure and mentally fragile that it shakes up their nested position.  So they lash out by reporting offenders to the highest management possible in order to get revenge.  That way, every manager from the top down \"knows\" what you did.
