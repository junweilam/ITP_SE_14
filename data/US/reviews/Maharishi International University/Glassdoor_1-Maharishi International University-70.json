For a school of people who have meditated for decades, the lack of progressive thought and policy is staggering. The younger demographic of the staff is steadily abandoning this administration due to their financially ultra-conservative stance on professional life. Room for advancement is nearly non-existent with most positions capping at $2k/month, permanently. Perhaps in 10 years or so when the older folks running this place can't do so anymore, they will realize the error of their ways. Invest in youth, invest in your successors, and maybe you will stop losing good people.
