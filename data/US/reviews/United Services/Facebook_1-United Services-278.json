They expect you complete so much paperwork on top of mandatory 80 hours face to face time with our clients. It's impossible ..\r\nThe turnover rate is absolutely horrendous and management makes us feel like we are replaceable. Management does not understand that the reason people leave is because of pay. During the covid-19 crisis, their true colors showed up. They did not grant hazard pay. They did not allow employees who COULD work from home, work from home. They provided the reasoning \"if everyone can't work from home no one works from home\". They furloughed half of case management staff and provided 1 day notice. They did not provide adequetly ppe and cleaning supplies. During the BLM protests they did not once address the issue and support the movement.\r\n\r\nNo respect from coworkers if you don't have a masters. \r\n\r\nThe ceo is an embarassment. At one point during a union meeting, she was banging her fists on the table while employees were negotiating increase of pay saying they have no money to give. \r\n\r\nTheir is a reason why their are so many negative reviews...
