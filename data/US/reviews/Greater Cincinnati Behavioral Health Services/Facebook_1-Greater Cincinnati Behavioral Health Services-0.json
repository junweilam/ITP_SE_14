I couldn't spend time with my family or I would get farther behind. As long as you were getting billable hours they didn't care.

You are still responsible for all the billable hours you missed. Take 5 days off to go on vacation with your family? You'll be working unpaid overtime for the entire quarter to get that time off. They can also deny your vacation even last minute if you aren't where you are supposed to be. I had murders and sex offenders that I had to visit with in their homes regularly by myself. Turn on the news...those neighborhoods where the gun violence is.. you will be ALONE in those areas most of your time working. Insurance is horrible!! Pay is below average from what I've read on sources like glassdoor. You will tear up your car and if you get stuck in the community with a flat tire or something like that you will be forced to take PTO hours while it is getting fixed and no one comes to help you. There is no support from management. People have been fired for suggesting change although they would deny it. They also teach you how to commit welfare fraud and then threaten you with being fired but also push for you to do those things. Driving a client and billing insurance is not allowed. But as a care Manager you will be taught how to word it so that you can still do it. FRAUD.  When capable people apply for SSA benefits you are not supposed to say anything that can keep them from getting it. Even if you know specifically that they can work and are doing under the table work.  Also...if hired...you may not make it through the training. They let people go in training despite not telling them it was possible. Last thing. There is little to no opportunity for advancement in this agency. You have very little opportunity if you are licensed in social work. If you have any other degree you have 0 opportunity to advance or grow. \r\n\r\nI know this will not keep everyone from applying but if it helps save ONE  other person from going through this madness it was well worth the time to write this."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "For your mental health, I\u2019d advise you to just not", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Care Manager in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I met some amazing team members and I do love seeing clients succeed", "cons": "The cons of this job far outweigh the pros. 1st) There are care managers in Amelia selling their mlm items to clients. These clients get upset when different care managers couldn\u2019t provide while care manager was on maternity leave. Supervisors did nothing to alleviate the problem or take action against illegal actions by care managers.\r\n\r\n2nd) You get paid salary with no overtime benefits, but you\u2019ll work overtime every week. You can\u2019t take your PTO because it will require you to work overtime another day to make up for it. Productivity is 4.25 hours a day, but during a pandemic and half the people don\u2019t want to engage or respond and there is little support to navigate.\r\n\r\n3rd) GCB is suppose to help clients employ numerous skills to being productive members of society. Imagine teaching others about kindness and grace when being overwhelmed and stressed but when GCB was staring into the unknown of the pandemic, they failed to use grace. They furloughed employees via email in the middle of a Wednesday. To make matters worse, they sent another email shortly after forgetting to remove those that were furloughed, telling the company that furloughs took place and if you didn\u2019t get the email you were safe. Then to discuss the stress from overwhelming client caseloads, they introduce yoga. However, yoga couldn\u2019t be used as a work time activity but they only offered it in the morning, on Wednesday, before team meetings, during the normal working hours. It was the first time I realized that employees are nothing but a number. If GCB valued their employees they would have used grace and then accepted accountability for their poor taste in handling furloughs. \r\n\r\n4) the turnover time is outrageous right now. Many teams are experiencing employees quitting leaving vulnerable people waiting and feeling lost. GCB is not approaching that gap with kindness or grace. They are just expecting their workers to saddle more clients."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Don't do it", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Care Manager in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only pro of this job would be the flexibility of making your own hours, but you are really at the mercy of your clients \r\n\r\nYou can get a nice bonus if you go over your required productivity hours, but it comes at a high price of over exerting yourself.", "cons": "Productivity: Productivity is a great concept to keep employees from being lazy and not doing work, but the way GCB does it should be illegal. You are expected to meet a certain number of hours each quarter, and you have the entire quarter to get those hours. BUT, if you decide to use some of your hard earned PTO, those days are not taken out of your productivity reports, so you are still expected to make up those hours you missed, even though you earned those days off. It's basically theft from the company and you are forced to work overtime the rest of the quarter if you don't want to be penalized. \r\n\r\nSafety: You are put in unsafe situations A LOT. There are times when you meet a client for the very first time, they have a dangerous background and you have to go on your own to their home to meet with them to satisfy the requirements. You have absolutely no idea what you are walking into.\r\n\r\nNot good use of degree: Half of your caseload will be clients that are somewhat reliable and have no problem meeting with you, the other half is hard to engage and you have to go out of your way to try and meet with them. There is a very high caseload, so if half is very needy, you spend the majority of your time dealing with them and you have zero time to reach out to the unengaged clients that need the most help. I felt like most of my days were spent at the grocery store with clients walking around,  and then carrying all of their groceries to their top floor apartment due to physical concerns, NOT mental concerns. I felt more like an aid/personal taxi driver than a mental health case worker. You shouldn't be expected to do tasks like that, and they encourage it because spending that time with clients is a way for the company to get billable hours and profit off of clients. I've had my supervisor call me and tell me a client has been tattling on me for not taking them shopping at walmart and I need to call them and set up a time to go, even though they are capable of taking the bus.\r\n\r\nNo support; The supervisors are busy too, and because of this you get very little help or support from them. Some teams have a lot of unison, and others do not. GCB won't even help you if a client breaks/destroys part of your car. \r\n\r\nBurnout: You get burnt out very quickly. It was nice to be able to go home early some days and work from home. But I was often so mentally exhausted I couldn't get off my couch to run my own errands since you are driving clients around all day running their errands. And you STILL have clients blowing up your phone when the day is over. I found myself doing notes late at night or on the weekends just because I was too tired to do them during \"work hours\".
