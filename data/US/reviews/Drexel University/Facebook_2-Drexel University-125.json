In meetings, increasing student rates is prioritized above all else. It's like higher admin and leaders see dollar signs with incoming students. Fine, bring in more students, but doing so without supporting burned out faculty who are already over-exerting themselves--giving them pitiful \"raises\", giving them no budget for materials, taking their classroom spaces--pathetic.

Shipping and Receiving staff do a great job delivering mail and packages.", "cons": "There is no investment in employee training or advancement (except tuition assistance which is great).  My department has zero budget for anything except what goes in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThere is no incentive to work harder or better, see below. \r\n\r\nRaises have no connection to job performance what so ever.  As mentioned in other reviews the University chooses a percentage (i.e. 2%, 2.5%, 1.5%) and that's pretty much what you get, give or take 1/2 % point. What this amounts to is a cost of living raise.  The problem is the people making the most, over 100K per year, get double the cost of living raise than those making 50K per year.  However, the cost of living increased EQUALLY for both parties.  This unfair distribution of cola raises increases exponentially each year.  Because raises have no connection to merit (Drexel calls them \"merit increases\") or actual job performance, this cost of living increase should be divided equally among employees (i.e. everyone gets a $2000 raise).  Some would argue that persons holding advanced degrees and higher positions deserve to make more money, and I would agree, because they already do!  Persons holding advanced degrees and higher positions are paid at least double or triple the annual salary of persons with 4 year college degrees.  That is the reward for the higher degree or position, double or triple annual pay.  The cost of gas, electric, food, rent, taxes, insurance, and medical care, did not increase more for people with higher degrees or positions.  When bills are due they don't ask, \"Do you have a Ph.D.? Yes? Okay, that will be 20 % extra then.\"\r\n\r\nBureaucracy, there is a lot of it.  Drexel has a chronic, \"It's not my job\" syndrome.  Many employees do not help students or other employees to the degree which they are fully capable. Some employees choose first and foremost to pass the buck and not take personal responsibility for a task or problem.  Issues that could be solved with a few minutes work, a couple of phone calls or emails, end up taking days or weeks to resolve due to, \"It's not my job\" syndrome and \"forwarding\" the problem to someone else.\r\n\r\nBelow average and truly bad employees are able to keep their jobs and will get the same percentage raise as the best employee at the University."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great experience learned a lot from all of the positions I held here throughout my graduate work.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 May 2014", "job_title": "Research Assistant, Graduate TA, Student Worker in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Every leader is very flexible with your schedule and understands that school is a priority.
