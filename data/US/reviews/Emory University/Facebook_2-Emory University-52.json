While a lot of the research being done is interesting, mentorship is often lacking and career development for students is not emphasized. Many students in my program are in their sixth or seventh years with no publications, and the attitude among faculty is simply that things \"take as long as they take\", and if you want to quit, there's the door. Advisor feedback on manuscripts and paper revisions often takes 6 months or more (despite the much shorter timelines set in the graduate school handbook)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Program Coordinator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tuition reimbursement and retirement contributions", "cons": "Better leadership structure and management"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "N/A`", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Emory is a ok place to work", "cons": "Yerkes Primate Institute is different from the rest of the campus"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good Work Experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Research assistant at Emory research project", "cons": "Hours are inconsistent week to week"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great benefits buy pay is low", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Research Coordinator in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible environment \r\nWinter recess - closed for week between Christmas and New Years\r\nGenerous PTO and sick day accrual\r\nGenerous 401K matching\r\nEligible for PSLF", "cons": "Low pay \r\nPay for parking"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Bioinformatics Analyst in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work place, good admin, great number of leaves", "cons": "Less than average pay as per the field"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Limited by the Ideologies of an Old Insititution", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Communications Specialist in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-very stable environment/steady job\n-flexible hours\n-matching investments\n-good networking opportunities", "cons": "-no bonuses\n-working from home is discouraged/restrictive\n-few opportunities for promotion\n-pay is determined by a range created across the whole university for your job title--doesn't matter your experience level"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "CRC", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Research Coordinator in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This job was not very demanding", "cons": "Theres literally no parking anywhere.

Even the slightest use of (justified) force triggers an Internal Affairs investigation that will go in your permanent employee file. Allot of Officers are hesitant to act in situations that require prompt action. \n\nThe greatest con, which is caused by the low pay, is that patrol shifts are operating at below minimal staffing.  An area roughly the size of a small town and a fixed population of 15,000 and up to 150,000 during business days with visitors is protected by 2-3 patrol officers on a regular day. \n\nAlso as a result of the low budget, equipment is very out dated.
