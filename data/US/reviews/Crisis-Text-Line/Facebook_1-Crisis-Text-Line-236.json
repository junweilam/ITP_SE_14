Leadership is generally aloof to mid- and entry-level employees. You spend a great deal of your time in meetings not knowing why you\u2019re in them. They\u2019re generally redundant discussions, and most times, you won\u2019t get an agenda prior to joining. I was often volunteered for projects without warning and expected to speak on something I wasn\u2019t working on. I also never received a performance review, and despite asking for one, was often given a task list out of context instead. I wouldn\u2019t expect too much professional development or mentorship here. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you\u2019ll be asked for input, but the irony is that your superiors have already made the decision about what ideas and tasks will and won\u2019t be executed. The request for input from you is purely performative, as are many of the campaigns around cultural inclusion. Leadership is not interested in real, systemic change, only PR materials.\r\n\r\nWorking here takes a toll on your mental health. I had a period after my 90 days when I was dealing with grief, so I opted out of certain meetings. When I told my supervisor about it, she initially gave me a response of indifference, which I was put off by, but chose to ignore it. HR nevertheless gave me approval to continue opting out when necessary.\r\n\r\nFurther, my first task when I came onboard was to hire an associate-level employee, as our former one had parted a month after I arrived. A full *8 months* later, we have not hired one and only recently did I receive support from the recruiting department. As a result, most of my tasks have been entry-level and my skills have been seriously set back. It\u2019s very clear that executives have more of an interest in expanding their own professional network than they do in hiring support for their mid- and entry-level staff, as they have been more keen on hiring leadership roles than anyone else. For a nonprofit, they are not considerate, thoughtful, or encouraging.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you ask for support, it\u2019ll often be deflected as a problem stemming from you rather than external factors.

Sure, I completed the training process and I luckily also have experience working in the mental health field, but I am extremely concerned that I have never been given positive OR negative feedback after volunteering 4 hours a week for nearly a year. Moreover, I have been transferred conversations from other crisis counselors that have been HORRIBLE (improper spelling and grammar, insensitive messages, etc.). To think that other counselors might not be getting feedback seriously worries me! I want to help people, but there really isn't any accountability here and a high turnover rate of volunteers. Also, the supervisors on the platform seem very overwhelmed. I ask occasional questions for clarity because I want to do the best possible job helping each texter, but some supervisors seem annoyed answering even one question per shift.

As a place that supposedly prides itself on empathy, kindness and self care they do not extend that to their own employees. The CEO has some major biases when it comes to how she treats the different teams and whom she deems deserving of elevating without the company. There\u2019s plenty covert racism, micro aggressions and the use of black and brown employees for face value to appear diverse. The culture of this company is to call everything \u201cawesome\u201d and calling people \u201crockstars\u201d which really leans to a particular kind of culture and often doesn\u2019t feel inclusive. \n\nCrisis text line as a whole and upper management teams are mainly comprised of white people and therefore they place many non-people of color in management and lead positions because of course you promote people that look like you and you believe you have more in common with. Just imagine your white counterparts with little experience at CTL or in the mental health field overall becoming your manager after 6 months to a year of being with the company. How can this person lead me or help me develop skills that will help me get to the nonexistent next level at Crisis Text Line when they never had to do any of those things themselves? The lack of clarity regarding the steps to being up for promotion and the clear favoritism creates a culture of backstabbing among team members because of course everyone wants to get ahead. \n\nThe loudest person in the room or the person that can weaponize their tears the best gets the promotion regardless of how well they function in their position. The quarterly review process is a joke because it\u2019s arbitrary and often my manager was unable elaborate when assessment questions were unclear. HR is 1 person and doesn\u2019t give much insight into what her purpose actually is because it wasn\u2019t define the positions and provide a clear path to moving up the corporate ladder. Titles were provided without any steps to get to said title and when I asked my manager she was unable to provide any info due to the lack of follow through by HR and upper management to complete the process. \n\nSelf care is nonexistent because the workload and the scheduling process is volatile.  You never know when things will change and how it will impact your life outside of Crisis Text Line i.e school, family, hobbies, vacations, etc. I would literally get sick to my stomach on the day before my work week started because the job was so toxic and I often felt trapped. I knew I was never going to get a promotion despite being told how great I was at my job because I\u2019m not white woman or a white man that could get in good with the white women. \n\nHere\u2019s an example of what a black or brown person has to bring to the table vs their white counterpart: A white woman with a 4yr education degree was COO and ultimately quit; the black woman that replaced her was a literal doctor with an extensive background in trauma. When that doctor exited the company due to all of the CEOs toxic behaviors and alienation of her black and brown employees she was replaced by a white woman that might have been with the agency for 1yrs and had multiple complaints against her as a team leader. She had no track record of being a director of anything trauma or crisis intervention related. \n\nThis job will leave you feeling like you are wasting your time. Being a Supervisor at Crisis Text Line is not a mental health position and you will not be developing any clinical skills here so don\u2019t bother.  There\u2019s no clinical supervision provided so please know that if your licensure requires this you will have to seek it elsewhere. Please read other reviews that are not by crisis counselors/volunteers because they are not actual Crisis Text Line employees and therefore can only review the actual crisis counseling piece to Crisis Text Line."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Doesn't walk the walk", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Volunteer", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity to help others in their time of need", "cons": "Made to feel like you don't matter \r\nPushed and pressured for spikes all the time \r\nClear favoritism shown towards particular volunteers\r\nManagement does not address concerns of volunteers. \r\nPressured to take more conversations at a time than comfortable with.

I\u2019m used to being in high pressure and fast paced work environments but CTL is that on top of the nonsense that goes on internally. The amount of turnover in the last 8 months is ridiculous and most of that has been on the Supervision team. Supervision is constantly overlooked for the work they do on a daily bases. Working from home could be a pro if supervisors weren\u2019t forced to accept awful schedules, feeling tethered to your computer and feeling stretched thin at all times. Work life balance...where? Because it\u2019s not here. You\u2019ll work holidays, weekends, nights, be expected to have all of the answers while on the platform and multitask the hell out of things so be prepared. Btw at one point supervisors were told they shouldn\u2019t be multitasking. An example of how petty things can be at CTL sometimes. Supervisors seem to be less and less satisfied as far as their value at CTL is concerned. Even though they\u2019re on the front lines with crisis counselors the crisis counselors are clearly the holy grail. Going to a company conference, having a 10-12hr day of smiling/socializing/making small talk then having to do my actual job duties shows how much supervisors are valued. \n\nWhat do supervisors get? Often it\u2019s just the short end of the stick...Oh and being reminded \u201cYou can work from anywhere\u201d  but it\u2019s shift work. Who wants to do that from anywhere? If in-office staff gets summer Fridays and that week off between Christmas and New Year. Once again what to supervisors get? Other than discouraged to take time off or sick days unless absolutely necessary because of the recent spike in turnover. \n\nTons of policy/procedure changes that make it hard to keep up with how things are done. Change can become a fearful thing with all of the emails saying were doing this one way this week and then next week were actually going to do it another way for the next 5 days. Then you\u2019re in a meeting and there\u2019s yet another change to that same procedure but only until 2am this time next Tuesday. Very confusing. \n\nCTL wants more diversity and inclusion but it\u2019s moving along very slowly. For a while it seemed like the only thing moving forward was advancing more women to management positions, which is great! However when the majority of those are women are non people of color I feel like the inclusion stopped there. Btw, no HR so there\u2019s no one to go to in confidence when you feel uncomfortable with what\u2019s being said or done. There\u2019s a culture at CTL that seems extremely fake especially with all of the office gossip and noticeable dissension. This culture feels forced upon employees and is actually very uncomfortable when there are boundaries you\u2019re used to having between your coworkers and your after work life.  CTL is not a mental health agency it\u2019s a tech company (you\u2019ll be reminded of that). So keep that fresh in your mind if you come from a social work, human service, psych, etc background.

It's reiterated time and time again that we are not therapists.  But a lot of the texters need just that--someone to talk to, to listen, and give them guidance. CTL wants the texter to do all the work so they feel empowered, but more often than not the texters calling in can't figure out a good solution THAT'S WHY THEY'RE TEXTING IN!

When will people learn that you don't have to talk for the sake of hearing yourself talk, especially when the topic has been repeated over and over again. \r\n\r\nThere is no HR so if you have an HR issue there is nobody to go to. The CEO thinks hiring an HR is a bad idea.  \r\n\r\nNancy, the CEO, will often log on to the platform to take shifts and then put the supervisors on the spot by asking them how she can improve. Is that a trick question?  She doesn't really want to know she can improve. She loves putting people in uncomfortable situations (and has admitted that.) She does it often with the office employees, at staff retreats, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe company is going through massive change right now which is good - hopefully the CEO can be a little more hands off and let the leadership teams do their job.  Change is good - it's how a company grows but what is annoying AF is how everyone is constantly complaining when things change. Why?  If the employees would just remember as the CEO stated: this is a tech company first and saving lives just happens to be part of it then all would be good. But most employees spend way too much time trying to change this or change that as opposed to staying focused on what's important.  Supervisors and coaches were hired to do one job and that's supervise and coach. You're either in it or you're not. What surprises me is how there is no structure or management when it comes to complaining.  \r\n\r\nBut here's where it gets good.  Every year there is a company retreat and other silly meetups throughout.  Unless you are super young, want to stay up all night partying, and then engage in ridiculous embarrassing team building experiences (think: scavenger hunts that require you to prank call someone or tweet something from your personal account) then this experience will be absolutely horrific. They make you SHARE A ROOM with other employees.  Yes that's right - you have no privacy for 4 days because you have to SHARE A FREAKING ROOM.  Just as I thought we were past that stage - (CEO just got done raising millions more and then goes on to brag about it) they announce another retreat that's even worse than the last few.  Not to mention, there are many employees who are being required to leave their little ones for a week.  That's right - even if you made your own accommodations you do not have a choice on where you stay.  One employee asked if she could bring her newborn and husband so she could breast feed in the room while she participated in the day activities and the answer was no.  I have worked at jobs where travel was required and never in my life have I had to share a room with a random stranger. I say random because this is a work at home job and you don't know your co-workers in person. They don't let you choose your roommate so you are stuck with whomever.  Good luck if your roommate snores or is up all night on their phone. Yes - that has happened to me. \r\n\r\nThey talk about self-care but it's nothing that is actually implemented and there are no real employee perks accept a few free apps here and there.  The job is hard and really takes a toll so it would be nice to have some real perks like other large companies (not everyone lives by a soul cycle.)\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of office drama when someone gets promoted and people talking behind other people's backs, yet when they are looking at each other face to face or when they are online, it is ridiculously fake and upbeat."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "If you are committed to mental health, think twice!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Relaxed work environment, can be very attractive initiatlly", "cons": "By far, this was the most traumatizing and ridiculous work experience of my life.

They claim to promote diversity and inclusion, but they do not! The most diverse this place gets is Caucasian, Gay, or Jewish. I feel for anyone that works here and is not one of those demographics. The CEO openly admits to actively hiring people of color when it needs to benefit the org, which is when they're getting money or need to look good for press. They recently started employee resource groups, which sounds positive but is likely a scam to keep the staff distracted so they don't focus on the executives' terrible practices. If you think this is the place to grow your career - think again! Promotions are only given to a select few and their friends. The CEO flip flops all the time. Staff are scared of Nancy's reactions.

I can but I know myself and for some people it's just not for them to take more than two conversations and they shouldn't be pressured to on a constant basis. There is the push for quality but really that is hidden under the bigger push for quantity.\r\nWe're expected to wrap up conversations with \"low-risk\" texter's in 45 minutes or less even if they need more time to talk, it's not encouraged. I kind of do what I want with this though since I've been around for a while and I care more about quality of conversations rather than quantity. I'd rather give them as much time as I can/they need so they can go on to more long-term resources over minimizing their time and ability to be more open because I have a time-constraint that is not self-imposed.

In looking at a current job posting on the corporate website for a Crisis Counselor Supervisor, the requirements are clear: a master's degree in a related field and if one is not present, a master's degree in a different field with a bachelor's in a human-services field plus relevant experience. This is not necessarily true and does not reflect the quality of supervision given on the platform for volunteers. We have (that I am aware of) at least two supervisors who do not have master's degrees in a related field or bachelor's. There is no indication they have adequate experience that is equal either. The should not be allowed to continue supervision unless they are enhancing their education and receiving those degrees to be equivalent to new hires or have acquired more advanced knowledge. \r\nFor one of the supervisors in particular her lack of awareness, ethics and other mannerisms important to this line of work is very evident in how she treats the counselors while they are volunteering.\r\nLastly, there have to be improvements made or this company will fall based upon poor management and direction or someone is going to sue some day for the amount of flaws present here.

If it weren\u2019t for the ability to work remotely, I would have to continue working locally with an hour commute for some cruddy, boring, lower functioning org (not a ton of work opportunities locally). The remote work definitely has its own set of challenges, but it gives me the opportunity to feel excited and passionate about the work that  I am doing. It can be tough in this hectic life to fulfill your goals as mom, wife, daughter, sister, etc. AND as strong career, goal oriented woman too. The opportunity to work remotely on the CTL platform allows me the chance to be close to my family, all while working in what I would define as the DREAM job. A job that far exceeds and surpasses what other opportunities exist in my rural Midwest community. \n\n\u2705Work Smarter, Not Harder\u2705\nFrom everything I have come to learn about Crisis Text Line, I am consistently impressed with what the organization is doing and how they are doing it. The level of communication that\u2019s achieved via texting nowadays is incredible. Crisis Intervention delivered via texting is beyond genius in so many ways. The procedural designs and systems set in place further embrace the power in providing interventions using this medium. CTL has enormous strength in what they are doing, brilliance in how they do it and limitless possibilities looking into the future. \n\n\u2705Powerhouse Team\u2705\nI have worked a couple different full-time (in person) professional positions during the past five years. In just a short time, I can honestly say that CTL is the most supportive and collaborative working team I have ever been a part of. Questions are heard and responded to promptly. Co-workers volunteer and volunteer often to help one another out. For most upcoming and prosperous organizations, it can be challenging to focus on staff as there are a bajillion other things that require the leadership\u2019s time. CTL still somehow always manages to put their employees first, regardless of new transitions. They genuinely care not only about staffs well being, but the crisis counselors and the texters well being too. Supervision team does not have an easy role whatsoever, but they sure are fully backed and supported by the teams entirety.\n\n\u2705Incentives\u2705\nInsurance package is covered 100% by the employer.

Because she gives no true ownership to her employees, and runs her organization according to a culture of fear and emotional abuse, every \"con\" listed is going to relate to her. If you are lucky enough to be mostly shielded from Nancy by your direct manager (a common practice by the good middle managers that remain at this company), you are still at risk for traumatic emotional abuse, and are still contributing to the ethically questionable practices that occur here on the daily.\r\n\r\nCTL is morally and ethically corrupt: \r\n- Volunteer crisis counselors are incentivized with gift cards and other rewards to take more conversations than they are equipped for. This is an extremely concerning practice for the people in crisis. It is also concerning for the crisis counselors who will deal (and do deal) with the trauma of being pushed to take more conversations, and therefore, are unable to counsel these people safely. \r\n- Nancy encourages misleading data. For example, she instructs staff and counselors to log into the crisis counseling platform simply to increase the number of \"active crisis counselors.\" \r\n- Nancy takes conversations with people in crisis--an ethically questionable practice considering her skill as a counselor. She often tells these individuals in crisis to \"just go to sleep\" or \"listen to Taylor Swift.\" Though Nancy claims her counseling skills are good, and above the average, they are not. Her data team tells her that is higher than most people on staff, and it is not. It is below the organization's average. \r\n- Her for-profit company (Loris) has more access to CTL's data than Nancy is letting on. She claims that no identifiable information is shared across companies--but her for-profit data team has access to CTL's data team.\r\n\r\nNancy leads a culture of toxicity and fear: \r\n- Nancy runs her organization like the president of the U.S. runs  his administration. Like Trump, Nancy throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way. Like Trump, when she is challenged, she responds with yelling, or name-calling, or a campaign of gossiping and badmouthing that person.\r\n- Nancy often publicly shaming employees in staff meetings-banging on furniture, or screaming and interrupting. People are afraid to speak up. \r\n- Nancy is insensitive and bigoted, and makes racist comments frequently. Nancy (at work, in front of her staff), has said things like, \"our supervision team has too many fat people,\" and refers to staff by their ethnicity, race, gender or sexual orientation. \r\n- Most staff members that work regularly with Nancy have required therapy to cope with the emotionally abusive cycle they are a part of. \r\n\r\nI urge you to be careful about working here: for your physiological and emotional health, for your mental sanity, for your values and ethics. Pay attention to the reviews that seem thorough, and real (\"Ethical does not exist here,\" from April 2018; \"Dictatorship\" from May 2017; \"What Happened If Donald Trump [sic] A Nonprofit\" from August 2016, to name only a few) versus the short and incomplete-seeming reviews that are mostly written by crisis counselors (who are part time volunteers, and who are almost never at their office).

The tension in the office everyday makes me feel like I'm going to vomit. What the company preaches is far from what it practices, though Nancy (the CEO) has lately had a more difficult time keeping the toxic side of herself from her volunteers.  The organizational culture is emotionally abusive, stemming from the CEO but also from the soon-to-be former COO. More concerning than anything though, is that this behavior is at a nonprofit organization that provides mental health services nationwide. Also concerning is the complete lack of regard for evidence-based and ethical practices. \r\n\r\nNotable examples: \r\n\r\nSuicidal volunteer crisis counselors who have texted into the service themselves requiring emergency services are allowed to continue providing crisis counseling services without concern for their own well-being and the well-being of our texters.

COO Baylee addressed concerns of this change by saying, \u201cThis is a business, not a democracy.\u201d \r\n\r\nSupervisors of volunteer counselors are no longer required to have master's degrees or relevant experience because the exec team got tired of the team identifying ethical issues and felt concern about licensed staff being required to report what they have seen in the organization. Mental health professionals expressing concern are told that if they don\u2019t want to be here they should leave. They\u2019re listening: 5 have left since August, and more will leave soon.\r\n\r\nI could continue writing on and on about the daily concerns of the entire staff. Crisis Text Line is not run by anyone with mental health education and experience, and the staff that do have these qualifications are silenced when they advocate against concerning practices. Staff are told that if they have a \"negative attitude\" they will be let go, and they have followed through on this threat before.

The CEO is very focused on numbers no matter the cost. Many volunteers are accepted despite their own mental health challenges, including recent suicide attempts. This is extremely dangerous not only for the volunteer, but also for the texters who reach out needing crisis support. It is unacceptable to allow someone who is in crisis to provide crisis support to another person. But, because that increases how many active volunteers there are and how many conversations CTL has provided, it's \"okay\" per the CEO. The screening process for volunteers is horrible, and once they are brought on they are poorly trained. CTL does not care about the quality of interventions just that they keep spitting out \"crisis counselors\" like a factory. If a CC has bad quality, nothing is done to try to help them. CTL wants to make the CCs feel good about themselves, they don't care how it impacts texters in crisis. Speaking of CCs, the majority of the positive reviews on here are written by volunteers who spend 4 hours a week with CTL and have no idea what management is like when they take the mask off. \r\n\r\nEmployees. CTL hires driven, and talented people to work for them. But, it's a waste as the CEO does not allow them to contribute or actually make any decisions. The CEO is a dictator and will have you redo something because she is the only one who knows what's best. Leadership rotates every 6 months so that the only person who has power is the CEO. The CEO has made references that degrees of employees do not matter - MSW, Counseling, PhD - you name it. None of these degrees matter or influence how a person works in the mental health space. \"Any one can do those jobs\". CTL has started hiring unqualified staff so that they can't speak up about unethical practices as a licensed professional would. Not only do they not have the skills to provide the necessary support, but they become the CEO's pawn since they will not make a similar salary elsewhere and are stuck in the org. CTL does not care about best practices or utilizing current mental health knowledge and research. They rely on their own \"data\", but forget the basic principle from Research 101 that correlation does not equal causation. Then again, anything one learned in school does not matter as the CEO knows best. The CEO pretends to care about diversity when in actuality she is very racist. While searching for a CMO candidate she said in an all staff meeting \"I will only hire a black person for this job because we need diversity in leadership.\" Anyone who speaks up about unethical practices is promptly fired for being \"too negative\".\r\n\r\nTexters. People who reach out to CTL in crisis receive poor support. If their crisis is not \"bad enough\" they are turned away or the CC quickly closes the conversation. Never mind the fact that many people will reach out with something trivial to test the waters before disclosing that they are actually suicidal. CTL does not care about this because they just want to open and close as many conversations as possible.  As I stated above volunteers are under trained and not equipped to assess and provide appropriate support. This can be extremely detrimental to someone who is reaching out in a time of crisis."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "very fulfilling work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Volunteer Crisis Counselor", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You're positively impacting the lives of real people and helping them feel less alone :) The techniques you learn in training may be useful to you in your own life too.", "cons": "This isn't a huge con for me personally but a lot of CC's have said that they spend a lot of time waiting in the queue to get texters.

I have noticed that broad, nonspecific messaging about who we serve (i.e. people who need to talk vs. people in crisis) is bringing on more volume than even 3,000+ crisis counselors can handle, and far more than the small-ish team of supervisors can handle. I have worked with hundreds of texters and have never received feedback, good or bad, on my conversations (despite what is promised in training). I work in mental health and feel pretty confident I'm not doing harm, but I worry about the thousands of other conversations that are not being reviewed and followed up on. I have personally seen some atrocious and disempowering conversations/examples/suggestions shared by other crisis counselors and staff, unfortunately including the CEO Nancy Lublin. At face value it is awesome to see a CEO jump into the trenches to talk with texters when we have high volume, but I would personally hope not to text in and speak with her if I was in crisis based on the snippets she has shared about what she has said or would say to a texter.  I'm concerned about the, for lack of a better term, cult of personality that seems to circulate around certain staff members - it makes their ideas/suggestions unimpeachable even when they don't align with training or best practices.\r\n\r\nWhen volume is very high, crisis counselors are pressured to wrap up conversations quickly and move on to the next texter. We are also pressured to take multiple conversations at a time. Not just 2 or 3, but 4, 5, 6+.

You will never see anything negative about what occurs - they must have forgotten the basic rules of good science where both sides are displayed for transparency in methodology. They claim to be open and transparent but I\u2019m not sure about that. Texters don\u2019t know data is being collected about them which is unfortunate as many are minors and cannot consent.
