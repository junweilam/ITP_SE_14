This demonstrates to me that perhaps the business priorities are lacking.  It is extremely outdated.

I was also hired to work in a day program, something that I loved, but which unfortunately had a reputation within the company of being the place people got sent to get fired, so needless to say morale was very low... Soon after I started working management instituted regular meetings where they flew in a highly paid (think $400/hr) lawyer from Chicago to say basically anything up to the legal limit that would slander the union and scare the employees present into thinking they would lose their jobs if they voted to unionize. After the first one of these I requested to be excused from attending any others so that I could focus on working with clients instead, and was initially was told yes, then later told no, I was required to attend. These meetings were labelled as \"mandatory trainings\" which meant I was forced to attend and listen to them lie and manipulate workers, many of whom had little higher education or familiarity with labor laws. Needless to say, the unionization vote failed.\r\n\r\nActual work conditions were pretty poor at my site. There was no schedule for breaks and we were not given a lunch. Clients were present for almost the entire work day which meant you had to eat with them (legal in my state, if questionable) and could only take a break if your coworkers agreed to cover for you. So, you were basically at the mercy of others to be kind and allow you a break, if it was even possible. The staffing ratio frequently made it impossible. It was common for me to spend 2-3 hours straight on my feet leading activities, making food and feeding clients, changing clients in the bathroom, and chasing other clients around who needed far more behavioral support than we had the staffing to give them, only to get a talking to after some other staff walked through the day program area and saw me sitting down for 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the workplace (beyond the fight over unionization) was extremely fear-based. During my first yearly review as a DSP I was told I had failed to meet goals that had apparently been set for me but I wasn't told about until I was being reviewed for them! Conversely, everything I had accomplished was ignored or downplayed. Since raises were based on a points system, I ended up with something like an 8 cent per hour raise because I failed to meet all of those mystery \"goals\".\r\n\r\nWorking on the residential side was slightly less stressful as management was not there constantly breathing down your neck, but more depressing. The house I worked in the most served clients in wheelchairs who were often parked in front of the television for hours on end, with staff making little effort to offer outings or enriching activities.\r\n\r\nTreatment was slightly better when I transitioned to working as a Job Coach, but again, pay was low compared to the other employers in the area, and morale was low. The only real perk was getting to work with clients 1 on 1, instead of having a crazy staffing ratio like 5 or 6 to 1, and being away from the constant micromanaging from management.
