As a hospice nurse of over 15 years, (working for now three agencies) I can honestly say that TRU exceeds the quality of care of other hospice agencies.  One of the most important differences with TRU as compared to other hospice agencies is their after-hours support team.  Whereas most other hopices have only 1-2 nurses simply on-call, TRU has a nurse answering the phones with several nurses working in the field, as well  as providing chaplain and/or social workers\u2019 on call if a family or patient requires emotional support.  This allows me and all the day nurses and staff, to be able to leave work at work.  I never have to feel concern or stress that my patients will not have the support needed at night.  This is huge!  Also, most hospice agencies do not hired full time physicians, making it more difficult to get MD support right away.  TRU has 3 full time MD\u2019s as well as a NP!  This allows access to an MD to  immediately obtain assistance and education to me as well as immediate assistance for medication changes and prescription fills.
