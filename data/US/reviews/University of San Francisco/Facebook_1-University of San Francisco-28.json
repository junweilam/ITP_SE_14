Rumor is that international students 'pay' for their grades. So much wasteful spending on projects that are not compatible to environment or need, eg., USF's new logo, which looks like Walmart's logo, and which replaced the former, elegant logo of many years. Thousands were spent upgrading everything to reflect the new logo which, I repeat, is cheesy at best.  This is a university that claims to change the world from there, with a focus on social justice.
