What's fascinating is that WASC Senior College and University Commission granted initial accreditation to Zaytuna College on March 4th, 2015 (less than 6 years after Zaytuna college was founded) thus becoming the first Muslim liberal arts college to be accredited in the United States. I have been working with Shaykh Hamza since Zaytuna Institute's time and benefited immensely from his knowledge, wisdom, character and vision. He is a true visionary and a man of high moral character. I have never seen him lose control of his tongue. The employees at Zaytuna love the founders and the teams have major respect for each other and for the president. I am sure that some of the people who were fired due to their ineptitude or lack of commitment are writing negative reviews, not stating the truth but satisfying their egos. Zaytuna College is not perfect and it's not supposed to be as we are on planet earth and perfection is only in paradise. If you get a job here at Zaytuna, you will happy and part of the history. We have a gorgeous campus, good mannered students, hard working team on the ground and educated faculty. The best way to experience this is to come and spend time with students if you want to attend the college, and with employees if you want to work.", "cons": "The drive uphill to the upper campus is challenging.
