Well, how is your time management?\" Or:  \"You say that your coworker yelled at you and others?  You must be too sensitive.\" Bullies tend to get rewarded with promotions.  One particular staff member was promoted and then proceeded to either push out or fire a long succession of staff whom they irrationally saw as a threat.
