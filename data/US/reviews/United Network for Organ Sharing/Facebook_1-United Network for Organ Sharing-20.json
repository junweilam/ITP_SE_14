They had graphs and charts to show and prove it. But after 3 years, the number of work items I completed started to decline because of various life issues I was dealing with. Instead of understanding that life happens and sometimes affects people, and offering help or resources, they instead demand that you pump out as much deliverables as humanly possible, or they cut you loose.\n\nThey are constantly firing people, seemingly for no reason. The manager who hired me was terminated a week after she hired me, and she had been there 14 years, as well as about 10 other employees who had a mountain of knowledge about the software developed at UNOS. Needless to say, while working at UNOS you live in constant fear of being the next target of firing.\n\nSometimes getting the latest source code from their versioning system would cause days of downtime while you resolved a mountain of issues.\n\nUNOS absolutely LOVES meetings. Sometimes they would have a meeting about a meeting. I calculated that on any given week, no less than 35% of my time was spent in useless meetings.\n\nDuring my final 2 years at UNOS, there was a massive surge in on-call incidents compared to my first 3 years there. I believe that the spike was the direct result of poor management.\n\nUNOS is run by extremely conservative boomers, who absolutely refuse to even consider a work-week that is less than 40 hours.\n\nUNOS offers remote work, but doesn't let anybody use it, except for a very small group of less than 10 employees, who lived out of state.\n\nThey offer a company gym, however I was specifically told to do my exercising at home, even though I never worked out on company time.\n\nThey have very unfair and inconsistent hiring practices. I saw someone with NO Microsoft development experience get a direct offer of employment, while others may get anywhere from 30-day to 1-year contract-to-hire offers, the length of contracts being very arbitrary.\n\nThey have an unusually high turnover rate, largely because of their constant firing people, but also because people would leave on their own because they can't deal with the daily nonsense that occurs in the workplace.\n\nThe CTO at UNOS also worked in a very high position at AOL, which crashed to the ground and burned.

My team is very close knit, and while my previous team at UNOS was also decent, my current one is much better.\r\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoy the work I do here. My team is great, I have a lot of respect for my manager, who is incredibly knowledgeable, and our director is also fantastic. Our CTO fairly regularly holds 'catch ups' to also discuss how things are going in IT as a whole. It's a great opportunity to discuss with the CTO what is and isn't working, and suggestions to fix anything that isn't working. I do not interact with anyone above the CTO regularly enough to have any strong opinions.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of opportunities to learn new things here. I currently work on several different products here using different technologies, so I get experience with a lot of different tech stacks. Our team also has 'fourth Fridays' where you can work on a project you would like to work on, learn a new skill, keep current with your existing skills, and so on. I really like this opportunity as well. I've worked on several interesting projects during this, and I love the opportunity to learn about new technologies as well.\r\n\r\nWorking hours are also reasonable, with no expectation that you will work 60-80 hours a week. I almost always work 40 hours, with the very occasional need to work more. Not to say that you won't have plenty of work to do while you are at work, but it is generally manageable. \r\n\r\nI also really like our benefits here for the most part. Our PTO/vacation time is fairly generous (2 weeks starting, 1 week of 'floating holidays' which are simply vacation time that you use or lose, the ability to purchase another week of vacation, and I believe it's 2 weeks of sick leave, but I am not certain on that). The 401k program is also good, although the vesting period is fairly long (6 years) if you plan to leave soon (which I do not, but it is still a consideration).\r\n\r\nOf course, the mission is also great. I really like the fact that the code I write is helping someone get a life saving transplant. For me, though, working environment and benefits are also important (which is why I focus on them here).", "cons": "Sometimes it can be difficult to get things done with other departments, which can affect productivity. I've needed to get my manager or director involved in several issues to push things along.\r\n\r\nYou would also be able to make more money at CapitalOne or CarMax, for instance, but overall, the working environment and mission make this trade off worth it for me.\r\n\r\nSome of the policies don't make a lot of sense to me as well. For instance, there is a policy that says you are supposed to get your computer erased upon your return if you take it out of the country or to take a loaner computer. With the amount of setup I'd need to do and software that I'd need to reinstall, this is a real drag to productivity. I could see erasing it before you leave (so that the CBP or whatever agency is in your destination country is not able to get access to UNOS data), but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to do it when you return."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Concealing layoffs?", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The mission, the mission.

Then watch that asset decide to leave as a result. Then the current CEO and the Board of Directors decide to choose a CTO that does not fit within the organization at all. As a result, the IT department is now in shambles. Almost all of the best IT employees have moved on and the ones hanging on are merely hoping for that ever constant changing of the guard that happens all too frequently at this company.
