A highly passive aggressive work environment where there was a great deal of infighting within departments and across departments. President and administration would often tout an atmosphere of \u201ctransparency\u201d however then made major restructuring strategic plans that laid off a large amount of tenured faculty with only a few weeks notice before Christmas. Pay for faculty was abysmally low, with benefits shrinking\u2014sabbaticals, for example, were simply suspended without notice. Teaching load was high with additional \u201cnon-mandatory\u201d work expected on a regular basis. There was a constant sense of secrecy from upper administration which led to a shady work environment. Job security was in doubt for many years leading to a sense of paranoia, confusion, and rumors among faculty and staff. High performing and professionally successful professors were undervalued and professional development was not rewarded. This regularly led to the most successful professors and scholars quitting. In some cases this included harassment/academic sabotage of faculty to create a hostile work environment that helped to push them out. Most recently this also led to a mass lay-off of dedicated longterm professors and staff who had given 10-20+ years of commitment and service to the university. Heartless decision making from senior administration. Faculty was not listened to or generally valued by administration or leadership, leading to greater faculty dissatisfaction. A recent increase in replacing longtime faculty with adjuncts in order to cut costs. Diversity and Inclusion was abysmal, with major problems occurring on the administration level (leading to faculty voicing votes of no confidence) and complete dismissal of faculty concerns.
