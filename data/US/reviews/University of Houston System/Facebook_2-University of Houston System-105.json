Worst than this, there is major corruption in the leadership of this university on both the college and university levels. Many leaders here will do whatever it takes to protect each other, with an emphasis on protecting people who are liberal. I am ready to find a university to work where employees respect each other, don't talk trash about each other, and actually build each other up instead of tearing each other down. Think that doesn't exist? It actually does. This is for fourth university where I have taught and the ONLY one where adults act this childish. Students are allowed to complain to the deans about faculty for not being fair to them. It's called a syllabus. Some of the teachers in the fine arts wings of the school are unqualified to teach at the university level. It's embarrassing.

She canceled meetings, when we DID have meetings she limited what we were allowed to talk about (meaning it had to be planned out in advance so she had time to prepare a response - thus killing any chance to brainstorm or be creative). She yelled at employees, told them to be quiet, even chased one through our office demanding that the employee come back to her. Childish behavior from a child. And leadership supported her. They let her chase off or fire 5 of the 8 people on staff within 11 months. She can't articulate what she wants from her employees, sets unreasonable expectations.... the list goes on and on. Basically, it all comes back to her being mean, rude, unexperienced, and UH is not providing her any training. \r\n\r\nThe last straw, however, was when she demanded that I call one of my employees who called in sick, demanding that she come in to work.
