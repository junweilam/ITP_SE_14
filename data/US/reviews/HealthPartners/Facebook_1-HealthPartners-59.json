The department in which I worked had 6 people resign in less than 4 months as a direct result of the way the department director and manager treated people. Training was nearly non-existent and in some cases, supervisors/managers didn't even know how to do the work their team members were expected to do. \r\n\r\nOrganizational \"re-structuring\" occurred two times in less than 6 months between May and October of 2018. When new members were on boarded to offer fresh insights and ideas for the team, leadership shut those ideas down, ignored the suggestions and continued to do exactly what they'd been doing all along. Ultimately, both of those new team members resigned after less than 6 months because of the lack of respect they were afforded by the department leaders.\r\n\r\nTeam members regularly requested clearly defined opportunities for growth (i.e. the creation of \"sr. roles\" within the department) from the department director and manager over the last two years and promises were made but never kept. When I left, after nearly four years with the organization, that department still had done nothing to move those requests forward - even though leadership continued to promise they were \"working on it.\"\r\n\r\nMerit increases were nearly non-existent and even team members who were consistently going above and beyond never saw more than a 2.5% merit increase on an annual basis. Some team members who had received great quarterly reviews and feedback from clients even were offered 1% merit increases - with no justification of why they weren't \"meeting expectations.\" While 2.5% was the max our department was apparently able to give for merit increases, I know other departments were able to offer up to 5% for their employees. \r\n\r\nThere was a lot of inconsistencies within the department where I worked as it related to merit pay and when questioned, leadership said it was a \"company wide standard\", but after talking to other people across the organization, it was easy to determine leadership was not being truthful about that. \r\n\r\nThe culture on the team in which I worked was extremely childish and unprofessional when it came to people who resigned or decided to pursue new opportunities outside the organization. In some cases, team members who announced their resignations were celebrated widely - with leadership planning their going away happy hour celebrations and announcing to the entire team how proud they were of those individuals and their contributions during their tenure with the organization. In others, once a person submitted his/her resignation, leadership ignored that person for up to two weeks (literally walking right past them without acknowledging them), pulled them out of all client meetings, refused to notify the rest of the department until that person's last day of employment and essentially black-listed them from everything and anything for the last two or three weeks of employment. \r\n\r\nFinally, if you are client facing and manage clients in any way, know that certain leaders are happy to do whatever is necessary to retain that client - even if it comes at an immense cost to the the overall health and well-being of the HealthPartners employee/s managing that client. I can not say this is true for all departments and certainly hope this is not the case for all areas of the organization - in fact I'm sure it's not.

The leadership in MSHO/SNBC is outstanding and when I speak of cons below, they are excluded from my opinion.", "cons": "I'm disappointed to see so many negative reviews of the Disease and Case Management department in the Bloomington corporate office but I must add another voice to that choir. I watched the staff turn over at a high rate while I worked there and unfortunately, watched the leadership dismiss it as personality mismatches or that staff didn't understand the expectations of the job. There is high turn over because there is a pervasive \"mean girl\" culture that starts at the very top of leadership in DCM. The staff have reported this on the last few years' engagement survey results and also it's been reported to HR on many occasions. Sadly, it seems that the issue goes high enough that no leader is willing to enforce substantial changes, the responsibility for which falls to the Senior Director. HR gives the impression that they are uninterested or unable to assist unless a direct complaint about a specific person is reported. Avenues for addressing culture were not offered by HR. \r\n\r\nFor those looking to work in DCM, you may want to know that the department knowingly underpays employees for their roles. A market analysis of department salaries was completed within the last 3 years and determined that the nurses were being underpaid $4/hour on average. This was true for me and when I brought market data to my leader and asked for an adjustment based on my qualifications and performance in my role, I was told that the department does not engage in market or merit raises. Each year that I worked there, the top performers were only offered a 2.5% raise annually, which does not keep up with inflation and results in a net loss of income over time. \r\n\r\nI am concerned that the department's unwillingness to grow, change and improve will ultimately lead to the undermining of the work. The Care Coordinators and Case Managers do important and impactful work with vulnerable patients. However, the telephone model is not sustainable in the current world. People no longer answer their phones for fear of scams and the population is turning toward more high tech options for interacting with their care teams. It is surprising that DCM relies exclusively on telephone calls to engage patients and appears unsustainable. \r\n\r\nWork from home opportunities have decreased substantially in the last year. If you are looking to work in this department, know that your ability to WFH will likely be far less than you are told in your interview, if at all. Expect to be in the office from exactly 8:30am to exactly 5pm. Computer activity is monitored and tracked to the minute and you may be asked why you had a period of several minutes without activity within the charting system. There are solid business reasons for this but there are also negative culture impacts as the staff is afraid to take a few minutes for anything other than active charting."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great mission, colleagues, and work.
