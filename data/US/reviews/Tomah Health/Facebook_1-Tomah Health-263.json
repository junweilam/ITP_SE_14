My coworkers are kind and fun and I feel like the leadership really cares and listens to employee concerns. I expanded a lot of the programming in my department and because of the increased work load, I was having trouble balancing my work and personal life. I spoke with my supervisor about the issue, and we were able to rework my schedule and the hospital added another position to help mange the new work load. It really meant a lot to me that the administration heard my concerns and worked with me to solve the issue. \r\n\r\nNot only does the leadership listen, but the benefits are really competitive. All employees and their immediate families receive 50% all hospital services, we receive great annual raises, and we also receive an annual bonus on top of the annual raise if we hit our target numbers (since I've worked here, I've always received at least a 1.5% bonus of my wages, but depending on our numbers, it can be up to a 3% bonus ).  If you'd like to go back to school, you can receive scholarship money from the hospital and they are great about working with your school schedule and work schedule. They are very supportive of continuing education and have paid for all of my continuing education credits and have encouraged me to seek conferences and certifications in my field. They also send out annual employee satisfaction surveys and actually change things based on the survey results. \r\n\r\nI can't tell you how positive this experience has been for me. It's the kind of work environment where managers in different departments know you by name, and the CEO stops by just to check in. There are not many companies where the CEO is actually known by the staff and makes an effort to be available and open to all staff, not just the managers. Because Tomah Memorial has it's governing structure within the hospital, it is also WAY faster for necessary process changes to be made because they don't have to go through 15 different departments at a corporate level. I recommend that you try out Tomah Memorial, it's the best job I've ever had.", "cons": "Because of the type of work I do, sometimes my schedule is challenging to manage.
