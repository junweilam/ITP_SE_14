Seriously, what a great job senior leadership did! In my cons, I'll talk a lot about the APA's seeming inability to actually implement change in an organized, decisive way, but the COVID response is an exception to that and something they got absolutely right. I felt safe, heard, and supported as we all made the switch to virtual, and I think I can safely say the same of all my colleagues.

We can tell it's changing, and it seems positive, maybe? But instead of saying \"Here's where we're at, here's our goal, here's how we plan to make it happen, and here's the timeline,\" management just kinda says \"Hey, change this one thing you do. We don't know how, figure it out.\" We've been in a particularly unsettled state for the last two years (and strangely, I don't think its pandemic related, but more \"vision for the association\" related), and it's evident in the vast number of senior leaders that APA is bleeding away. 2 - the right hand has no idea what the left is doing because there are pretty much no common practices that apply organization wide. Every directorate has different policies, and every team within every directorate has different policies. It means that workloads are nowhere near comparable from team to team and it only enhances the siloing issue. 3 - Speaking of that siloing issue, everyone seems to recognize it, leadership calls for tearing it down, but noone seems actually willing to do the work in a sensible way. Instead of setting concrete ways to decrease the siloing, leadership seems to be of the mind that they can just create positions that directly report to multiple different bosses in multiple different directorates and teams. There is a reason that successful organizations have clear reporting structures that, no matter how flat, do not typically include asking employees to report to more than one manager. It's unfair to the employees put in that situation, and unfair to their coworkers who are stuck vying for time when their colleague can \"switch\" to working on their side of the house.

It's great to employ psychologists at the APA, but every manager and director doesn't need to be, and shouldn't be, always only a PhD/PsyD. The organization desperately needs more, well, organization and modernization. So many Directors and Senior Directors here are hopelessly disorganized, overwhelmed, and less effective than they could be if they had better management, workflow, and organizational skills. Unfortunately, when you get a bunch of psychologists together, you often end up talking about a dozen different potential work models, but never sticking with one and creating solid operating protocols.
