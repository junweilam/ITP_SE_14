Overall not happy with the way the hospital managed the pandemic. They took away hours in the first shut down, with little options to get paid. There was no support with EDD benefits. A lot of employees lost all of their PTO trying to survive the shut downs. Poor overall hospital moral. Poor overall moral in the OR. Management finds temporary or short term fixes to major problems. Management doesn't fix problems quickly and effectively. Some very bad attitudes, in older staff, who cause drama and think they run the place. OR equipment and instruments are out dated or old technology. It takes years for new surgeons to get the supplies and instruments they need to advance the OR and provide better patient care.
