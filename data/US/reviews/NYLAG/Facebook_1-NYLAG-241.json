This would keep certain units from going bankrupt (which is what is pretty much happening within my unit). In my case, this problem is also due to poor management and very little accountability by the director of my specific unit. There is also a bit of the high school lunchroom feel at times- I guess that's the downside of having a fresh-out-of-college crowd. The downside of the loose management style is that rules are often enforced at the whim of personal discretion; there is definitely a George Orwell-1984-esque feeling of  \"some animals are more equal than others\". You are encouraged to work a 9-5 although it isn't really realistic given the breadth of work you have to accomplish and you better budget very very carefully (read penny pinching!) if you're going to live in New York on your own off of it.
