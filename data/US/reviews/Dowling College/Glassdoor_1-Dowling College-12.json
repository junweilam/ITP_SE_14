They are constantly reorganizing employees, moving employees, and changing the structure. However, it never works. The salary situation is a complete disgrace. I have never received a raise - not even a cost of living increase. The wages were frozen about 5 years ago, and everyone's salary was cut 2 years ago. Some people making less than when they started. The tuition remission policy was altered, which was their best employee benefit. The worst part of my job is attempting to navigate my day without being verbally abused by my manger. My entire department spends their day trying to appease a manager that is completely out of control. I have spent many nights awake dreading the next day and replaying the many insults I suffered at work. I have called out sick on occasion, because of verbal abuse. The interesting part is my reviews are great. The management is well aware of situation, but they will not take action.

Worst compensation (salary specific) of any college. Most salaries are around 20% lower than peer competitors in higher Ed. For example same position pays $48k-$54k most other places. WORST vacation package of any college - two weeks vacation is unheard of in higher Ed industry and they don't even give you the standard week between Christmas and New Years off to boot!  With abysmal wages they should at least have better vacation package. No money for anything we were always told, while there were 6 luxury Infinities for senior management in parking lot as if they were a Fortune 500 company or an institution on par with say Hofstra, and to allow that when they haven't given raises in 4-5 years! Disgrace. No respect from senior management. We were treated and looked at as worse than dirt when most colleges I worked for similar department we were treated excellent and understood we were a revenue center/were sales force bringing in the enrollment revenue and given tools and accolades to do so. Not at all true at Dowling. No understanding or idea of enrollment management principals, practices or philosophy. The college deserves all the negative press it has received, because while I was there it felt like it existed not to provide the poor quality, overpriced education they do, but instead existed to provide a certain few in senior admin their lifestyle and luxury company vehicles."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Academic Coach", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "10 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Counseling Health and Wellness Counselor in Holbrook, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities for continuing education, enrichment.
