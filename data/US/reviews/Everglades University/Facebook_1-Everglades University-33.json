I just love working at the Boca and Online Division campuses.", "cons": "At Everglades, students are the first priority and they have to have access to all staff on their first day of class. So, once a month, I have to work from 9:30am to 9:00pm, on the first start date of the term of classes. (classes start once a month)  I think the library should be open until atleast 10pm  because students are in classes at night from 6pm-10pm and we close at 9 on Mondays, Tuesday, and Wednesdays and students are still coming in at 9pm. On Wednesday and Fridays, we are open 10am - 7pm. Therefore, I wish I had one more librarian to help out with the hours. That extra hand would allow us to be open so that we could be open longer with a real librarian on duty at all hours. As the University grows that maybe a possibility. I envision a new EU library where it would be a brand new facility with a very large library with lots of study areas for the students and a testing center. Right now, we just have two tables in our small library. It is not easy trying to come up with cons are they are just what is expected of a professional librarian at Everglades University.

I\u2019m currently going for my Bachelors in Alternative Medicine, the science track. I was tired of just thinking conventional medicine was the only form of healing so I did my research and fell in love with natural medicine. Many people don\u2019t know or understand that pills and surgery are not the only way to treat the body. With herbs, rehab (mental/physical), mind/body/spirit healing, and other natural healing modalities, there is a better chance of longevity and quality of life. It\u2019s not one way or the other, both forms of healing (conventional and alternative) should be used for optimal health.  I\u2019m looking forward to graduation because that\u2019s when life really starts. With this degree, I want to better myself and heal the lives of others by changing their circumstances in a more positive way. My goal is to become a Homeopathic Doctor, Doctor of Oriental Medicine (DOM), or open up my own line of natural products. Everglades University provides a great learning environment. I love how the classes aren\u2019t too big, it allows for more individualized attention to their students. Since the classes are smaller here, the teacher has more time to focus on each student which has really helped my grades and GPA go up. The teachers and staff are always available to go the extra mile to help students in every way they can. I used to be terrified of public speaking and presenting in front of a group (even a group of 5 people) and I became stronger due to the support from all my fellow colleagues. Just by overcoming that obstacle, I developed self-confidence and made new friends. This university has taught me leadership skills that I can carry on with me throughout the rest of my life.
