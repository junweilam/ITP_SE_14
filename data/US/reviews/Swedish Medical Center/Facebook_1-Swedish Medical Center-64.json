There is five weeks of orientation, and if you ask question it will count against you. The nurses are very catty and back stabbing, this place is an example of how nurses eat there young. Dangerous staffing ratio 1:8 and not enough techs to help out 1:20. Patient are charged everything down to the toothpaste. They only care about money not about safe patient care. Very high turnover, nurses are given scripts on how to talk to patients because all they care about hcahps which is low to begin with. If you are robot and no sense of self this is a great place for you. There is no support for nurses, and they will write you up for any little mistake. If you want to be a refreshment and narcotics nurse, This is the place for you. Computers in the medication room doesn\u2019t work, have to write down all medications. They only care about the money and do not support their nurses. They also use Meditech, which sucks. They say it was new and improved Meditech but is something out of the 80s. They\u2019re too cheap to buy Epic, which probably will improve their patients satisfaction scores and medical errors. Doctors are extremely rude to staff and treat them dirt.  They have an extremely high turnover rate, they pay the worst out of all hospital systems in Denver.  The benefits suck, $1200 each month. Stay far far away from this hospital. Highest needlestick incidents in the country. They also use the cheapest equipment and supplies.
