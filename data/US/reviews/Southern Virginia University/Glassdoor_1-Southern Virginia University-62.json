As my co-workers I continued to be guided by their example and heartfelt outreach both when I began my teaching as well as throughout my time there. The Faculty Development Committee was generous and extremely supportive in helping me pursue both research and instructional development goals. During my first year, a faculty member offered to meet with me in weekly meetings where the agenda was set mostly by my questions. We discussed instructional theory, degree requirements, past course content, current events, professional development opportunities, institutional goals among other topics. Other faculty offered first-year-teaching suggestions sincerely and humbly. Truly, my experience coming into the organization was noteworthy. It was (and is) easy to see the love and concern the faculty have for the students and for the institution. I thoroughly enjoyed the many and storied examples of faculty sacrificing time and resources for the students. \r\nMy classroom teaching experiences were probably not ordinary. Students were not intimidated to share their personal beliefs about the world or about themselves--their hopes and dreams, as well as their struggles and obstacles. This willingness to share was constructive and led to additional understanding.\r\nI remain extremely grateful for the opportunity to work and learn together at this special institution at this special time.

I'll outline a few:\r\nBecause of the nature of a university that's still in its growing stages, there are opportunities to get exposure to many areas within the organization. While in my position, I was able to work in 4-5 seemingly unrelated roles, and interacted frequently with other departments. \r\nAdditionally, a strong commitment to the mission, success and growth of the university is pervasive across all faculty, staff and students. Because it's a small university, coworkers can easily become friends, and the result is a tight-knit community of hardworking individuals striving for the same goal. \r\nI also always felt a strong sense of transparency from management about the state of the university, policy changes (and reasons for them), as well as announcements that wouldn't normally reach the employees until weeks or months after implementation.", "cons": "With the \"start-up\" nature of the university comes a certain culture of overloading. While family-friendly and welcoming, it's not uncommon to have individuals so overworked that they're either unable to spend time with their family/friends or who feel guilty doing anything other than work. Managers may make efforts to persuade their employees to take time off, but most don't exemplify that behavior or (consciously or unconsciously) encourage a disproportionate work-life ratio. There are certain departments that, of necessity, need to be available and working 24/7/365. However, on top of that it's not uncommon for one employee to be laden with so many responsibilities (this happens at every level of the administration, faculty, and staff) that they hardly have time for anything else in their life. Often an increase in responsibility does not come with increased compensation or allowances in other areas of the employee's role. \r\nThis has been the case for the last 10-15 years, and as the university continues to mature I hope that this cultural phenomenon becomes less prevalent."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Southern Virginia is a great institution for higher learning.
