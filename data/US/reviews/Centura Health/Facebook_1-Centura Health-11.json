Management has laid off most lab techs so nurses have to draw most labs. Management laid off night supply personnel so nurses have to rummage around the basement of the hospital to find bags of saline etc. Management even decided nurses would deliver and pick up all the meal trays to patients for a while. Not that we were busy and already never getting a 30 minute meal break off the floor ourselves. Management demoted most associate nurse managers in recent years to save money. Terrible for morale. They have a staffing matrix they strictly adhere to; if there are not enough admissions to the hospital, they will send staff home in the middle of the night. Worse, if census is low when you're scheduled for a shift, they will \"push back\" your start time without offering nurses and call pay. So, if I am scheduled for a night shift, they might \"push me back\" two or three times, finally telling me at 1 am that I don't have to work. The nurse assumes 100% of the financial risk here, and the hospital gets free nurses on a string. Nurses cannot plan for a regular paycheck as this happens frequently. Management claims to be ethical, but this practice proves they are far from it. They don't try to do this to doctors; \"why don't you sit around at home on a day/night you're supposed to work and we'll call if you need you\". By the way, you get no compensation while you've planned your entire day around working a shift, only to have your hours (and effectively your pay) cut. This may be legal, but it is very unethical. People have bills to pay and need predictability. I honestly can't wait to leave. The only thing keeping me here are my wonderful coworkers."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Centura", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Speech Language Pathologist in Colorado Springs, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with other therapists/MDs/RNS\r\nAcute care setting", "cons": "Management needs work, less competitive pay"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Float Pool CNA", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 May 2021", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Colorado Springs, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supervisor was understanding and cooperative\r\nPay was good at $15.75 because of experience\r\nFloat pool differential was an extra 1.25 \r\nNight was $2", "cons": "Working float pool was a little overwhelming for me.

Leadership monitors bathroom breaks and even asks employees to consult with them if they need to spend extra time in the bathroom (absolutely unheard of and ridiculous). Department leaders are not investigated even after departments experience high turnover and they are also extremely unprofessional. This was a decent company to work for prior to their South Denver merge. Their lack of adequate staffing and forcing staff to cover multiple COVID areas on top of their current duties has caused a huge delay in patient care. As a patient I no longer come here, and I advise family members and friends to avoid Centura at all costs. It was unfortunate to see what was once a good company to work for turn into an unethical and greedy corporation that does not care about the health and well-being of employees and patients they claim to serve.

Leadership is more concerned with how they look and the next step in their careers than their people or patients. Certain leaders are protected by HR and those that speak out end up gone. This is so extreme that the leaders over supply chain and telehealth were forced to \"leave Centura Health to pursue\u00a0other opportunities\" in the middle of a pandemic while volunteers were flooding to the corporate office at night ironing trash bags to make PPE and patients needed increased access to telehealth. Employees get PTO days which include sick time and holiday pay so\u00a0if you start at the wrong time of year, you may have a negative PTO balance,\u00a0just due to mandatory holidays (up to 11 a year while I've been here) for the first 9 months you are there.

The main hospital is maintained well and has had extensive remodeling in public-facing areas including the cafeteria, ER waiting room, and and main atrium. However, many parts of the facility are neglected entirely, including the behavioral health units and the outpatient Centre for Behavioral Health.\r\n\r\nThe outpatient Centre for Behavioral Health located across Harvard on Downing is in dire need of refurbishment, but the Company has refused to invest in it for decades. There is literally rust dripping from the outside of the building onto white paint. The inside of the building hasn't been touched since the eighties, except for some minor configuration changes in one hallway. One day we literally found a letter from OSHA warning us that asbestos was found in the building and that we must take care not to disturb it. Our management sent us a memo telling us to make sure we did not kick any tears in the (30+ year old carpet) because it would activate asbestos. The OSHA memo stated that Porter had failed to respond to the complaints that asbestos was found in the building and thus was posting a public notification.\r\n\r\nThe air conditioning in the Outpatient Behavioral Health building is broken most of the time, and the building smells like a combination of mold and moth balls. Most of the rooms do not have windows. The patient consult rooms are in the basement (accessible to wheelchairs by ramp) while management sits up top in the non-ADA accessible area, locked away from its employees.\r\n\r\nMany clients remark that if they weren't feeling depressed, the dingy carpet with holes (remember, don't kick it, we know about asbestos!), the dim lighting, the Golden Girls Wallpaper, moth ball smell, and rusting away exterior would make them depressed.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the facility has been brought to the attention of Centura several times, with no action taken. Instead, they are planning on remodeling the already modern cafeteria, as the behavioral health patient care area endures decades of neglect.\r\n\r\nCompare the center to any other unit, such as oncology ward or joint replacement clinics, or the brand-new CHPG at Porter, or the sports rehabilitation clinics. You'll see modern architectural details with new stylish surroundings, plush furniture, indoor fountains and waterfalls. These are the areas the hospital makes money.\r\n\r\nGo to the Adjacent Porter Centre for Behavioral Health and you will get a clear picture of what is wrong with mental health care in America. It is neglected, pushed to the side, in a basement. It doesn't generate big numbers like cancer, so it continues to decline. It is embarassing to have to explain to patients why the building is in this condition, and they are left feeling second-rate and stigmatized for needing mental health care.\r\n\r\nI would recommend those seeking behavioral health care visit their County Mental Health facilities. They are much more modern and will allow you to keep your dignity intact. \r\n\r\nCentura's willful neglect of its behavioral health facilities stigmatizes those who require treatment, but they seem to have no intention of turning that around.

He also doesn't have a Masters Degree, yet requires it of leadership positions beneath him. He has driven out or fired the incredible leaders that have gotten Centura to the very advanced technological state that it is (especially apparent now as I work at another renowned health care organization that is functioning nowhere near the level that Centura technology functioned). In an effort to mask his inadequacies, he bullied his employees by yelling at and belittling them both in meetings and in private. I actually witnessed him telling an employee that his answer to a question was \"stupid.\" There is never a need to belittle and berate employees in a professional setting. I hope to never encounter this complete lack of professionalism again.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, I was in a higher level position, but being paid at a rate that was laughable. Many analysts made more than me. After 2 years and leading HUGE initiatives for the company, I asked for a raise and was ignored. When I threatened to quit, they finally offered me a huge raise, which they said is what I deserved to be getting, and told me it was already in effect before I made my final decision to leave.\r\n\r\nBecause I could see how dismal the leadership was performing, and how undervalued IT now is at Centura even though they are among the best in the nation (as the accolades show), I kept my integrity and quit anyway, despite the gigantic raise. I was not going to reward a company with my hard work and performance when they treated employees so poorly.\r\n\r\nTurns out, they lied about my raise being effective in an effort to manipulate me into staying on the sinking ship (as I was one of the few leaders left keeping things afloat).  My last paycheck and PTO payout were exactly the same measly wage that I had been enduring. Just another nail in the coffin. \r\n\r\nLastly...they have lost the drive to put patients first. That is what got me up in the morning. Now it is all about growing the footprint and making more money. The word \"patient\" wasn't even in the manifesto that the new CEO wrote regarding the new direction of the company. Patients should always be at the heart of everything we do. If we are doing what is amazing for the patient, we will become successful. If we are focusing on the wrong things, we will fail.
