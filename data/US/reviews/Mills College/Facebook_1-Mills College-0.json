Lack of training and a loss of knowledge from long-term employees who have resigned, on top of constant leadership changes, have made the institution completely dysfunctional, making it difficult for Mills to get back on its feet. Salaries are not in line with the high cost of living. Benefits used to be excellent and helped make up for the low salary, but those are constantly being cut and are now below average and no longer an incentive. Staff lack a union and are frequently taken advantage of and asked to do more with no salary increase. Mills would be an outstanding place to work if not for its years of poor leadership destroying the college that unfortunately has continued with the new president. If Mills can ever get it together, you'd be foolish to not want to join the family, but at this point in time, it's a depressing and completely frustrating place to work. :-("

Higher management has a habit of promoting themselves, hiring their friends or partners on a regular basis which leads to staff feeling excluded and underappreciated. Staff often feels bitter that we are in the same positions, same salaries (raises are rarely given-just \"cost of living raises\") and higher management keeps getting promoted.
