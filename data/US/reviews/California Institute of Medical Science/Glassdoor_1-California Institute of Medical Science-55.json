No opportunity for growth or advancement.  No benefits.  Privately owned and ran so there is no real HR to talk to about grievances. There is an amazing 3rd party HR company on payroll  but where they can offer advice that's about it. So this is a good position for \r\n someone just starting out in any of the admin positions or instructional.  I havent known of anyone to have worked more than a little over a year. So if your okay with a job to get your feet wet and build your resume you'll be fine at the Institute.  Pay for admin positions are very low in comparison to the other schools in the area."}], []]
