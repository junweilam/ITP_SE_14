I am fortunate to work for one of the best supervisors in our university and have found flexible policies ensure our department is able to perform at a superior level. \r\n\r\nHR: Their knowledge of university programs and policies has been immensely helpful over my many years of employ. Honor and integrity are core values evident when one walks through their door. Dedication (to staff, students & university); fairness; equity; and a proactive demeanor permeate everything they touch. ATSU's HR department provides some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. Never have I seen a harder working group of people. \r\n\r\nTRAINING: Annual training has been streamlined leaving one feeling the authors truly understand how valuable their product is. Kudos to the team for designing a training package which is user friendly, targeted, memorable and time sensitive. \r\n\r\nBENEFITS: Benefits are excellent!

Whilst I work for an exceptional supervisor, as in any large company it's quite possible not everyone is as fortunate. Our benefits have the potential of being a double edged sword. Anyone unfortunate enough to work for a supervisor in need of \"additional training\" has a responsibility to discuss the matter with a department that can help. HR and Diversity come readily to mind, along with the multiple Safe Zone volunteers around the university. Keeping silent does not bode well for the employee, supervisor or university. It is  everyone's duty to recognize and call out those cancerous elements of the human psyche that make for a less than harmonious working environment. \r\n\r\nBENEFITS:  The downside of excellent benefits is that sometimes mediocrity chooses not to move on. It's hard to find other companies with a benefit package as good as ours. Because our HR department goes to great lengths to help disgruntled employees find a path to \"enlightenment\", I've found there have been, on occasion, employees who create a difficult working environment for others. If things weren't as good at our university I would expect those people to move on - but they don't. I don't feel this is a huge problem because it's apparent by the quality of employees/students at ATSU that leadership goes to great lengths to find the \"right\" people for the job.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION: ATSU is afflicted with bureaucracy, as is most large institutions.
