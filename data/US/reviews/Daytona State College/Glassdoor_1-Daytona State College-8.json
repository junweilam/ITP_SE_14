I\u2019ll admit it was a stop-gap solution, but I regret the decision I made. A person in management is irritable, erratic, and is constantly marching around the office like a 5-year-old child. The person was not present within the department that is, they weren't really a part of Academic Advising but rather more of a marketing person, trying to increase funding that goes to Academic Advising year-to-year through \u201cinitiatives\u201d. All the new employees joked about things this person would do and say, they would yell from their office to other colleagues and their mood was constantly changing from one hour to the next and people would have to tell the person to \u201ccalm down\u201d. I have no idea why they put this person in charge of Academic Advising; I think it was one of those things where they just promoted someone who had been there for a long time. An unsettling trend in academia is it\u2019s not about skill but about \u201cyes\u201d men. There was a person in management who was ok and we considered the real person in chargee and ran most of the integral aspects of Academic Advising, the only problem was kissing the behind of others above them.  The dual enrollment coordinator hated their job.\r\n\r\nAcademic Advising was run in a way where you wouldn\u2019t just have to know Academic Advising, but admissions, financial aid, accounts, records, and dual enrollment. They wanted you to advise on every aspect of the college while they offered you an underwhelming 35.6k a year which is $17.12 an hour. They would constantly say a strength of Daytona State College was that you could switch departments but that\u2019s because they have everyone doing someone else\u2019s work. Some of the issues that came up were unclear expectations for the employees and lack of support. It was impossible to know what was expected. When you thought you were doing what you were supposed to, you weren\u2019t, and vice-versa. Issues would arise within the department the manager would never give a firm answer to a resolution, and would just blow it off and ignore it. Another thing I hated was the manager's \u201cside-projects\u201d they would increase the workload on employees for the sake of being trendy to secure more money for the department. The employees were miserable, everyone talked about the low pay and the environment was average at best.\r\n\r\nA little add-on about another higher member of the company in upper management who wasn't liked by anyone creeped everyone out and had a serious case of big ego-small results. This person was known as the suit-person every day and wouldn\u2019t acknowledge you unless he needed something. This person would make silly comments in meetings, to show how important and powerful they was, and I think this was again a case of promoting someone who really shouldn\u2019t have been promoted. \r\n\r\nOverall skip this place, the management sucks, the pay is terrible, there is no room for advancement and the employees who stay there for a long time are left thankless. Don\u2019t burn yourself it\u2019s not worth it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It was a very positive environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Student Peer Tutor in Daytona Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great communication between manager and staff", "cons": "Sometimes not busy at all"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not Good", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "9 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Financial Aid Counselor in Daytona Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free Education for a two-year or four-year degree.", "cons": "Discriminator, nepotism, low pay, President is not so bright!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Daytona Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is fine over here.", "cons": "No a cons over here."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Positive workplace.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Front Desk Receptionist in Palm Coast, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work schedule and holidays off.", "cons": "Opening are hard to come by."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Largest Employer in City", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Daytona Beach, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities to continue education at college.
