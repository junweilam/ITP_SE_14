They are obsessed in becoming the most dominant healthcare organization in Colorado and that at all costs. Physicians are obligated to see a lot of new patients, when they have no availability to see their established patients. It takes months for a patient to get in to see a specialist. When you try to refer patients outside UCHealth, so that they can get better care, the leadership pulls you in meetings and you get scolded.\r\nAnd did I mention that the physicians benefits are below average ?\r\nThe sad part is that all the other big healthcare corporations in CO are the same or worst. Small private practices cannot survive financially and they are swallowed by these big corporations. Signing with them gives you the illusion of job stability, but they treat you like they own you. \"Take it or leave it!\"\r\nSometimes it really feels like even the receptionists or the MAs are treated with more respect than their physicians.\r\nAre you a physician who envisions having some level of autonomy in the way you practice? Well, then this is not the job for you. Here you do what you are told. It is all about \"the production\".\r\nMore recently, they started hiring lots of NPs and PAs, because they simply do not get enough MDs interested in their job positions. So my advice is to stay away from UCHealth and find yourself a job somewhere else."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great staff terrible Management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Assistant in Aurora, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Each department has incredible staff willing to go above and beyond to help.", "cons": "Can be group oriented.

Despite the inability to keep staff nurses around, the hospital continues to expand and the system keeps acquiring new properties. UC Health is sinking millions of dollars into expansion and executive salaries, yet reduces RN pay and refuses to adjust staffing to match acuity. Leaders have absolutely no concern for or clue about how overworked front line staff are. Ultimately, it's the patients who suffer, and the mix of high acuity, inexperienced nurses, and routine short staffing will show its deleterious effects on patient care."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Large Academic Medical Center", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Physician in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well trained faculty and staff", "cons": "Few resources are put towards employee satisfaction and benefits."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2020", "job_title": "EMT-B in Colorado Springs, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive yearly wage increase based on performance and great retirement benefits", "cons": "Not the best starting salary"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Low pay and very poor management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Patient Access Representative in Fort Collins, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None that I can think of.

These are my frustrations: Expensive, not- so-competitive benefits (my health insurance rates tripled when I went to part time- $266 per pay period) management does not listen, Med-surg charge nurses take up to 4 patients at night, day charges can take 1 patient during the day. I've been fighting this a long time, this is dangerous and defeats the purpose of a charge nurse. You also have to be on a committee so once a month on your day off you will be expected to attend a committee meeting and report back to your unit about it. \nYou will be pressured to get certification in whatever your specialty is, but there is no pay increase associated with it. \nThe only way to really increase your pay is to \"level up\" which is a lot of work, and only applies to university hospital. If you leave to go to another hospital, you lose your level 3 or 4 title. \nNot worth it in my opinion. To be totally transparent: I've been an RN for 3 years and I make $26.30 base pay. I started there as a new grad. \nUniversity loves to brag about how they are the best hospital, but the way they run their hospital does not reflect this. New grad RNs can expect to rotate night and day shifts for the first couple of years. They got rid of their weekend incentive agreement a couple years ago, which offered a bonus for RNs that signed contracts to work weekends. They just nixed the night contract too. This is a huge pay cut for RNs who work exclusively nights. For full time RNs, this is a $4000 pay cut per year. Management says they \"might\" increase the base pay, but I doubt it. \nRecently, some senior nurses who had been there 6 plus years who hadn't rotated in years were told it they were not a level 3 or higher, they were required to work one night shift/month. We've had a lot of turnover recently as you can imagine. \nOverall, I feel like I'm continuously expected to do more with less (I know this is universal in healthcare) however, I have friends who work at other hospitals in the Denver metro area, and when I tell them about my situation at work, they are shocked, and tell me their hospital does not operate like that. \nUniversity has high expectations of their RNs, but don't offer incentives and pay that match this. They treat their RNs like they are disposable and in some instances I've seen them push senior nurses out the door. Not a great work environment.

Memorial has been poorly managed for the last 5 or 6 years, but there was a lot of hope when UCHealth came in and bought us. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that hope was misplaced. As an organization, we have been losing money for the last 7 years. UCHealth came in and put in emergency cost-cutting procedures. But then they lost their CEO, and now they are fumbling for what to do. Everything is disorganized and LOSING money. Just look up Memorial articles the local papers (Gazette and the Independent) and you will see all of the financial issues.\r\n\r\nThe reason for these issues is because of poor management and also because of very low morale. I have been a full-time employee here for over 10 years, and I would NOT bring my family here for care. Trust me on this, care here has gotten very poor. Nurse morale is way down.\r\n\r\nMost of the causes for these issues can be narrowed down to mismanagement, executives who don't know what they are doing, and way way way too much middle management. Lots of middle managers need to be shown the door. \r\n\r\nAlso, the entire Memorial organization is very oudated when it comes to computers. Most of the staff does NOT know how to work a computer, and our IT (formerly called IS) department doesn't know either. Many of the computer programs still run very outdated Windows versions and many even still use DOS for their programs. Basically they have not updated their technical infrastructure since 1987. I'm not kidding or exaggerating. I do think that this may change with UCHealth coming in, but seriously?! \r\n\r\nHR is a joke and have no idea how modern companies are supposed to be run. \r\n\r\nOur CEO and CFO recently got fired, on the SAME day with no notice! That pretty much sums up how bad things are. The new CEO, George Hayes, won't be here for long either.

Management and administration have a culture of abuse and cover-up questionable instance that happen at the hospital. Just In the last 12 months there have been three staff members who had committed suicide on campus. None of these incidences made the media because the media has been paid off by the hospital.  A neurosurgeon committed suicide in his car in the parking lot of the hospital and nobody spoke about it! Another employee hung himself from the balcony of the hospital and staff members that saw the incident were asked to go home and or resign from their job.  The Hospital is so voracious in their ability to squash any negative reviews  that this review will be taken down as soon as they find it.
