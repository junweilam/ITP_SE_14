Everyone in the office was either trying to leave, miserable or burnt out. It was very hard to be inspired and get exited about working at GA because every thought or new idea you had was immediately snuffed out. CEO was almost never there and spoke unkindly to and about many people including talking about partners behind their backs. She also abused her power over others, had to oversee every little detail to the point where everyone was always waiting for her to get back to them and refused to admit her faults or evolve the organization. It seemed like she was more interested in her GAP practice and was just using GA as a source of money. Senior management was very disorganized and had monthly \"gossip\" sessions about the other workers. Overall the whole office is at a standstill despite what they may tell you in your interview. Communication was poor and more often than not you will never know someone has a problem with you or your work until your supervisor tells you and it turns into a mountain of anger and frustration when it was a tiny mistake to begin with. \r\n\r\nBe warned that a lot of the positive reviews on here were written by SMT trying to cover up the negative reviews and keep their 4 star rating. The office is different for everyone and I am sure higher level staff had a better work experience since they were treated better but be wary of all the \"perfect\" reviews, they are not truthful."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "In sum: Great place to gain experience, caring staff, but senior management a bit impulsive", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Mar 2010", "job_title": " in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-great benefits/work environment (casual dress, pets allowed, gym membership)\r\n-very lenient work from home policy\r\n-competitive pay\r\n-caring staff\r\n-nurtured professional growth\r\n-phenomenal location\r\n-\"appreciation\" days", "cons": "-senior management changes their mind a lot on strategic approaches\r\n-required \"focus\" readings/meetings\r\n-9 hour days\r\n-priorities of senior management outweigh general practice/efficiency when they come into conflict"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Jan 2010", "job_title": "Intern", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "unique experience, lots of intellectual freedom, employess at every level truly contribute to the organization and its future, definitely worth it!", "cons": "low salary, lots of projects - must be a multi-tasker to enjoy working here, no private offices unless you are a VP or higher"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Un-professional", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Program Manager in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Don't have any to submit at this time.", "cons": "Sent in all my information for a position.
