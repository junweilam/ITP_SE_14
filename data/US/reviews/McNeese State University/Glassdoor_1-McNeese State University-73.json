We make 10 bucks an hour and that's not going to cut it.  I have also worked at the Old Ranch where the cafeteria is located and not only can you find mold everywhere but it reeks of mold everywhere as well.  As a person eating there I am not sure how you can enjoy your meal when you know the place is invested with mold, I am very surprised OSHA, or any state food inspectors have not inspected this place out yet.  I have also seen raccoons in this building along with plants growing up on top of the roof.  Next time you walk past the old ranch you should pay attention to all the plants/weeds growing up on that roof, its a disgrace.  I know I wouldn't send my two kids here knowing all the problems they have, my kids went elsewhere.  I have also experienced very cold temperatures in the winter in this building and very hot temperatures in the summer in this building.  The building doesn't have a proper HVAC system, and when you call maintenance they are actually incapable of fixing the problem.   What do you expect when they are not licensed HVAC repair men.  The students pay 8K for in-state tuition, 13K for out-of state tuition, and 19K for being an international student, don't you think they deserve more for their money than what McNeese is currently providing them.  McNeese has recently invested heavily in the mens BB program in which attendance is abysmal to say the least.  McNeese should of taken that 45 million on the new HHP/basketball arena and built a new student union/cafeteria, where students could actually get some use out of the facilities.
