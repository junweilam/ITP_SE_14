A lot of organizations have mission statements and values but my experience with Metrohealth is that those things are practiced every day by staff and it shows. Being in Information Services (our IT department) I get to work directly with all departments, from EVS, Public Safety, Human Resources and Clinical staff, and throughout, everyone holds the concepts of 'Service to others' and 'Teamwork' to the highest regards.\r\n\r\nWhat brought me here to do this review was my experiences over the past few months; I wanted to emphasize how this culture has helped us during the COVID-19 pandemic; very early on it was clear that changes were necessary to prepare ourselves for what was coming and steps were taken quickly by various departments.

MH is stuck in the past. Their technology is so outdated, and it takes months for IT to fix the simplest of issues.\r\n\r\n2.) MH does not care about patients. Managers always come up with excuses about why they cannot talk to patients who want calls escalated. Offering to put patients on a wait list? It doesn't matter- nobody is calling to add patients onto the schedule because we are so understaffed. There is one manager in particular in a department who nobody feels supported by, yet that person still works at MH somehow.\r\n\r\n3.) MH constantly lets go of amazing employees. One of our former employees was awesome, she actually wanted to make changes and improve morale in the call center- what happened? She was fired, without cause and without notice.\r\n\r\n4.) MH loves to have MBAs run healthcare. This is a huge problem for healthcare in general. Our dept head demoted fantastic employees, fired employees who actually care about patients, and has driven over 10 people to quit in the past year. When I resigned, they didn't even offer an exit interview (but they gripe about not understanding why nobody stays). \r\n\r\n5.) HR does not care about employees at all. I tried not to let the disorganized on-boarding process negatively influence my opinions about MH, but the longer I worked there, the more I realized it's a system-wide issue. People are lazy and rude- many employees are just waiting for their retirement money and don't care about providing good care to patients.\r\n\r\n6.) Constant issues with getting things done for patients. Guess what we can't do? Call your doctor or nurse's office. They don't even let us have their office #s. Those who run the hospital understaff the front offices so badly that they can't take calls and it often takes MONTHS for patients to get issues resolved, especially if it involves paperwork. I will never recommend this mess of an organization for anyone looking to get excellent healthcare- this outfit doesn't care about your health, your needs, your family, or anything that you might need beyond the basic check-up. \r\n\r\nAll Metro cares about is your money. You are a number, and this is why so many doctors leave Metro within a year or two of being hired on--just wait, if your doctor hasn't left yet, they will."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "The most fulfilling job I've ever had", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Marketing Communications Specialist in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "MetroHealth's incredible mission of service.
