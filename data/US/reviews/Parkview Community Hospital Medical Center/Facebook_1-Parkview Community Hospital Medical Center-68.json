I consider them family. \nI did enjoy the job itself. It wasn't difficult work, but you can easily get behind; and hard to catch up if the census is high. I did learn a lot about my job through my co workers. If I had any questions they were very helpful.", "cons": "This hospital went down hill fast after the new company took over. They don't honor union contracts for the non-clinical staff. \n\nBenefits: This company refuses to give out raises, even though it is in the union contract. They offer the staff the cheapest medical insurance. During this pandemic they did not offer hazard pay. \n\nManagement: Supervisors don't bother to learn your job. But they have no problem telling you how to do your job, even though they have no idea how the system works. So good luck if you need help, or if someone calls off. They expect you to stay, and do double shifts; or work several days consecutively over a normal work week. They will take advantage, and over work you. If there is no one to cover your break, and it's a busy work day you won't get a break. Which is illegal.\n\nManagement will bring the morale down for their employees. They will tell you over and over that you are expected to work harder, and faster; and if you're unhappy, or refuse to do the work then there is the door. Everyone is replaceable no matter how many years you put into the company. It doesn't matter if you have never had a write up, or near perfect attendance. There is no loyalty, and they won't value you no matter how hard you work. \n\nHarassment: Management will make you sign papers, and have an annual meeting about work place harassment. But in reality if you complain about someone harassing you, or bullying you; they won't do anything about it. \nThere was bullying in the work place, gossip, and backstabbing. Management will say they will take care of it, but they never do. They just turn a blind eye. It forced a lot of good workers to eventually quit. There is a lot of favoritism in the department. \n\nSince the pandemic there has been several lay offs throughout the hospital, to save the hospital \"money.\" Whoever is left to work is expected to pick up the extra slack. You'll be working several job duties per shift; with no increase in pay.\n\nCoworkers:Some of the RNs were really rude, and looked down on you. But then there were others that are very friendly.  \n\nConclusion: I would not recommend working at this hospital."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A",
