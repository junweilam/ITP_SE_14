However, I will attempt to highlight some that I find to be most important, as I view Glassdoor as an opportunity to provide real insight to potential employees. Also, I want to clarify that my bias will be towards clinical care, as I am a registered nurse. I have no first hand knowledge of other areas.  So, as they say, caveat emptor.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, there is our guiding mission.  \"No child should die in the dawn of life.\" The work that we do on a daily basis does indeed help save lives.  I have seen advances in treatment and outcomes first hand.  It is slow and incremental, but it's there.\r\n\r\nOur benefits are better than the norm. I've compared our benefits to other institutions over the last five years, and dollar for dollar, ours are better.  I'm sure that there are exceptions to that, based on personal needs and familial situations, but on average I'd pit our benefits package against almost any employer in Memphis. \r\n\r\nWork/life balance.  12 hour shifts can be brutal, but our ability to self-schedule helps ensure that we can have the time we need to recover.  There are instances where changes have to be made, and we don't always agree with them.  BUT, that's a risk you run with any employer.  We also have the added advantage of paid holidays, personal time, PTO and sick time to supplement our days away from the job.  Many of us take that for granted, but for most hospitals give employees less time away.  And they typically have ZERO paid holidays.\r\n\r\nNon-clinical employment opportunities.  There comes a time in our lives (as nurses) where the bedside is no longer an option.  It could be age, physical condition, or mental fatigue.  Regardless, there are numerous options away from the clinical setting for those that would like a change.  Yes, there is competition. No, there aren't always positions when we want them.  But in life, patience is a virtue.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would say a sense of camaraderie. This is both a pro and a con. Many shifts (again, I am speaking solely to nursing) and units feel very much like family.  We can be very tight knit, supporting one another in times of distress, whether it's professional or personal.  We celebrate triumph, commiserate with one another during defeat, and we mourn our losses as one. I am proud to work on my unit, and I call many of my colleagues friends.  I've not felt the same in previous roles, so I embrace it.", "cons": "It would be dishonest of me to omit the flaws that I see (personally), so I'll outline them as best i can. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, there is a sense of camaraderie and of family.  With that, though, comes the formation of cliques and aloof behavior.  It waxes and wanes, but it does happen.  Often, we are able to \"self-correct\", but sometimes it leads to alienation of new employees.  It's something of which we must all be mindful.  And like most families, we have our share of dysfunctional family members who are negative, loud, or downright cantankerous. We are but human.\r\n\r\nSalary. I'm sure I've never met anyone who was completely satisfied with their compensation package. That said, I sometimes feel as if we aren't as competitive as we could be.  We as an organization set ourselves apart from other hospitals in most regards, but then choose to use local market comparisons for pay.  It seems counterintuitive if the objective is to recruit premier talent from across the country.  Adjusting for cost of living, we are still paid less than nurses at similar institutions with similar prestige (UCSF, Dana Farber, CHOP, and Stanford to name a few). \r\n\r\nPaid Time Off. As I previously stated, I feel like we have sufficient time off.  The con is that we continue to place time off in multiple buckets (sick, family sick and vacation).  My preference would be to see my current time off placed into a single PTO bucket, for use at my discretion.  While I'm sure there are those who use sick time on a consistent basis, I know a number of individuals who are no longer accruing sick time because they have reached the maximum allowed.  My concern is that other entities that have made the transition from Sick/Vacation route to PTO have decreased the overall benefit, and that would be detrimental. \r\n\r\nLimited advancement potential. While there are a number of roles away from the clinical area for nurses, there is limited upward potential within inpatient nursing.  Each unit has 6 coordinators, and there are only four manager roles.  It can be discouraging if you desire any sort of upward progression.  Couple that with poor to non-existent career guidance, and you have created an environment that encourages one to look outside the hospital for advancement.  \r\n\r\nShift differentials. A common complaint is the loss of shift differential for time off. If a dayshift employee takes time away from work (vacation/sick/personal time), then they are paid their normal salary.  A night shift employee who takes time away is \"penalized\" for taking time away, as the 20% night shift differential is not paid on unworked hours.   I'm also aware that the shift differential is intended to compensate employees for the hardships placed on shift workers who must adapt to unusual working hours.  My personal feeling is that it's equally difficult to \"flip-flop\" from a night to day circadian rhythm and that the hardship of shift work doesn't end just because I've chosen to take a day off.  I would also point out that it is not unprecedented.  The federal government currently pays shift workers differential for unworked hours, as do many state governments.  Additionally, there are entire industries that do as well.  \r\n\r\nAll that being said, none of the cons I've listed are deal breakers for me.  I only include the cons to illustrate both sides to the same coin."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Love working at St. Jude!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Memphis, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the best places to work!

The people here are generally nice and most of them are happy to be here. St. Jude is growing and is financially healthy, which bodes well for future employment and growth opportunities.", "cons": "Unfortunately, like most employers, St. Jude has it\u2019s flaws. In my particular position in Enterprise Informatics, I am the primary (well, really the only) resource in my area. If an issue arises, I pretty much have to respond to resolve the problem. Essentially, that makes me a resource that is on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. Of course, it really isn\u2019t reasonable for someone to be on-call 24/7/365 but that is basically what it feels like and management has pretty much admitted that is the reality of my particular position. It was pretty disappointing to learn that being on-call all the time was the reality and the expectation of management, as that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the job description when I applied and it wasn\u2019t mentioned to me as a requirement of the job when I was interviewing for the position. This is a pretty big job requirement to somehow get left out of the job description and not get mentioned when interviewing candidates. How does it manage to get left out? A candidate should not find this out after accepting the job and beginning to work at St. Jude.\r\n\r\nThe biggest negative about being the only resource in my area (and being on-call 24/7/365 as a result) is that it makes it difficult to mentally separate myself from work, even after leaving St. Jude for the day. It leaves me wondering what I would do if I am out to eat with friends or family or at a movie theater and suddenly receive a call for help \u2013 will I be able to respond in a reasonable amount of time? What is actually a reasonable amount of time in my situation? Should I even go out to eat or to see a movie under these circumstances? Do I need to clear my plans with my boss before going? I certainly don\u2019t want there to be an expectation that I have to clear my personal life & weekend plans with my boss, as that encroaches too much on an individual\u2019s personal life to be reasonable. I haven\u2019t been told that this is the case, of course, because no one in management has ever made it clear what the expectations are for responding to a call situation.\r\n\r\n I also have to think about it whenever I am considering traveling on weekends outside of my normal work hours. What happens if I receive a call while I am away? Will I be able to find a business, hotel, etc that has Wi-Fi? What if I am on the interstate or highway miles from any place with usable Wi-Fi? Again, do I need to clear my plans with my boss before going? What happens if I cannot respond for whatever reason (bad cell service, lack of WiFi access, etc.)? Will I be reprimanded? Will I be written up? Will I be fired? The expectations of management and of St. Jude as an organization have never really been clear in this regard. There are lots of little details like this that I am forced to think about because of the constant on-call aspect of my job, when I really should be free to focus on enjoying my life outside of work. Since there isn\u2019t a clear separation between the two (work and personal life), it is sometimes difficult to enjoy my life outside of St. Jude.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be true to say that I don\u2019t receive a call every night or even every week but it is still a difficult position because no one can truly be available to respond to an issue all of the time. Life happens and sometimes people aren\u2019t available. What happens when I cannot respond? I imagine that if I told my manager that I couldn\u2019t respond, then he would try to deal with it himself (I have no true backup, so technically my manager would almost certainly be my backup). The problem with that idea is that he doesn\u2019t truly know some of my work well enough to fix a lot of issues by himself. He would probably need my help resolving a decent percentage of system issues, which would mean me trying to walk him through resolving the problem over the phone. Of course, in that situation I might as well have taken the call and resolved the issue myself in the first place. So, relying on a backup person (ie, my manager) to provide me with some down time probably wouldn\u2019t work out very well.\r\n\r\nIt is an unfortunate situation and I wish that there was a better solution that allowed me to truly be off duty on certain nights or weekends. I know an obvious suggestion that people might mention would be communicating with my supervisor on this particular issue but I am a little worried that this might cause some friction between myself and my manager if he senses that I am unhappy with this particular expectation of the job. I feel that it would be easier and clearer for everyone if there was a specific policy that covered this situation (ie the \u201calways on-call staff\u201d), as it shouldn\u2019t be up to me to have to clear up confusion over a pretty important job requirement like this one.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up: St. Jude as a workplace as a whole would get 4 stars but I can only give 3 stars in my case because I feel that the 24/7/365 on-call expectation isn\u2019t a realistic option, encroaches too much on personal life and should have been communicated clearly to me as a requirement of the position beforehand. \r\n\r\n If I had truly known about the 24/7/365 on-call expectation beforehand, I would have requested significantly more money (either in the form of a large bump to my yearly salary or as on-call pay, something I currently do not receive) before ever accepting the job. I certainly wouldn\u2019t do it for my present salary and wouldn\u2019t do it for anything less than a six figure salary.\r\n\r\n I know HR does salary surveys for our positions but I highly doubt they are taking into account that some of our IT positions essentially require us to be on-call 24/7/365 whenever they are comparing our positions and salaries to the positions and salaries of other employers. As a result, the salary surveys in some of our cases are almost certainly an apples-to-oranges comparison.\r\n\r\nIf I leave St. Jude in the future it will almost certainly be because of the 24/7/365 on-call expectation and St. Jude\u2019s lack of clarification on how we can respond to call requests and have work/life balance as well. Long-term, I have a feeling that is probably what I will do, so that I can set appropriate boundaries between work and personal life and so that I don\u2019t have to be married to a cell phone and laptop every night and weekend."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "RN", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Sept 2017", "job_title": "ICU RN in Memphis, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "As a nurse here, you are appreciated for the work you do by the administration.
