One word kept coming up: Cult. I took the job anyway because the pay and benefits were good, and the site looked clean, people seemed nice. After orientation the veneer wears off and you see WestBridge truly is a cult like atmosphere. You are literally given a list of approved phrases, and you will be speech and thought policed the entire time you're there. No one can be trusted, and everyone has to talk like robots, saying the same key phrases and holding the same ideas. If you question this in any way, you put a huge target on your head and will be called in to HR for re-education camp. They constantly claim they want feedback and to hear your voice, but this is a trap. In actually their model is a like a religion to them, and any questioning or independent thoughts will be punished. \r\n\r\nThe model is intentionally slow and inefficient. Insurance does not cover most of Westbridge's care, so patients are allowed to stay in pre-contemplation for YEARS without making any progress, so that Westbridge can keep milking their families for thousands of dollars every month. I have worked in long-term dual diagnosis care before, and there is no reason for it to be as slow as Westbridge is making it. They are taking advantage of desperate wealthy families and providing sub-par care. I was only there for 2 months and observed multiple relapses and re-hospitilization, and life endangering medical errors such as patients not being given their anti-biotics. \r\n\r\nWork life balance is poor, as you'll frequently find yourself staying late in meetings or up all night answering phone calls and having to drive back to work to deal with a crises. Turnover is extremely high despite good pay. This should be a huge red flag. \r\n\r\nOverall, I found management to be incredibly controlling and untrustworthy. I would not recommend WestBridge as a career path or as a treatment facility."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Outstanding organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Vocational Specialist in Manchester, NH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Incredibly supportive and compassionate staff and colleagues for participants and co-workers.
