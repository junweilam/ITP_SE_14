Management never communicates well and because of this the rumor mill is insane! too many politics involved with management. Friends hire friends and there is no recourse when there is a terrible manager in place, no one listens and backs the staff up. The unit I worked on had 4 nurse mangers in 5 years. The PICU hardly ever has patients so I feel they are under experienced and under equipped to handle a true PICU load. you will  be forces to have a flu shot of be fired which always felt like a violation of my personal right to decide what I put into my body. The cafeteria stinks, little choices and not good food. Although the hospital serves the urban community and 1 in 4 medical professionals suffer from the disease of addiction, Metro has nothing in place to help. If a doctor or nurse admits he or she is an addict and they need help they are fired and reported to the board. No pay differentiation for education (ASN paid the same as BSN)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "They are more concerned with how many patients they can see than the quality of care that is given!", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 May 2017", "job_title": "Certified Medical Assistant in Wyoming, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very knowledge staff.
