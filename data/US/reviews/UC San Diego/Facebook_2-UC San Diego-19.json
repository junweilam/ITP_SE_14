In addition, these promotions are usually group affairs, so you'll have a cohort of folks to help you out while you advance. Generally coworkers are very good here, in particular some of the career coworkers are some of the nicest folks I've met, period. \r\n\r\nBeyond this, two other benefits stand out in comparison to other jobs I've had - for one they will *always* schedule around your classes, school events, and clubs as long as you notify them of your schedule. On top of that, your schedule can be negotiated, and is reasonably flexible. And to put an extra layer of icing on the cake, if you live on-campus, you'll be assigned the unit closest to you (as long as they need staff). \r\n\r\nThe second major boon is the Perq program - for student workers and leads, you get $10 in Perq per shift (with more if you work >6hrs, or more than one shift a day) and for student managers it jumps up to $19. This may not sound like a lot, but it can be as much as two to three proper meals during your shifts, all for what is essentially free. I've met students who keep working here simply because the Perq program exists and gets them half of their meals for the week - hell I've been that student for months at a time.", "cons": "One of the first major cons is the volatility of your student coworkers. For a lot of folks, this is their first job, and as such if you're a student manager, you'll be expected to train them through all the basics they need to work in HDH. Don't get me wrong, I've met some good friends through HDH, and you will too! But you'll also meet folks who just make you want to pull your hair out, and there's really not much you can do about it besides being kind and pushing on. \r\n\r\nBeyond all of this, I really do need to mention the pay issue. With Covid-19, I understand that HDH had a genuinely rough year, however the fact that pay here remains scarcely above minimum wage (when I started it *was* minimum wage) is a little frustrating. I get that this is a pocket-change job for some of the students here, but for a lot of us (myself included) it's how we pay our bills; or at least part of that equation. Frankly I can only think of two coworkers who were satisfied with their hourly pay, and it's often the case that we'd discuss how boned the campus would be if all the students here quit on account of low pay, and how frustrating it is that HDH doesn't acknowledge that and pay us a decent wage for our work. Dining is definitely not where they're making most of their money, but it's a cornerstone of campus, and the folks holding that up - regardless of if they're students, career chefs, or managers - should be compensated appropriately."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Benefits, Working Hours vary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Lab Assistant I in La Jolla, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at UCSD offered great benefits (health, dental, vision), and even priority access to COVID testing and vaccines.

There is no training into how to hire people and the rules constantly change resulting in frustration and wasted effort.  HR negotiates with the union and only appears to protect employees.  Although there are many outstanding staff members, the system can select for the  incompetent, especially as the job market is hot in San Diego and university pay is lower than in industry.  If your group is small, making the wrong hire can be a devastating error as  the union makes it very hard to let people go.  Young untenured faculty who have small groups and less experience are likely to be hurt the most by making a hire who is a bad fit.  Because one is afraid to hire, you tend to hire less and make do with a smaller staff, which results in more stress for existing employees and less job growth in San Diego.   Also, there is a five year postdoc rule so if you have someone that has been with you for five years you have to decide between offering them a lifetime job that will take months to approve and require an external search, or letting them go.   This system pits employers against employees and sometimes does not benefit either.  I would bet that many employees would actually trade higher pay for less security and this would allow the university to better compete with industry."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent place to work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Teaching Assistant in La Jolla, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly people, provide opportunities to grow, allow chances to take up leadership", "cons": "None to think of as such"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Student on campus job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Account Payable Assistant in La Jolla, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work environment, welcoming and supportive colleagues.", "cons": "There may be time feel a bit disconnect due to the pandemic"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Working Experience at UCSD", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great weather here in San Diego and the living cost is not as high as other big cities like LA or San Jose.
