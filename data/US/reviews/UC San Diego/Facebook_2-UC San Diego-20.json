On top of parking fees, many staff positions are union positions, which means $48 in union fees are deducted each month regardless of whether or not you join the union.  Considering that the last union-negotiated raise that I received in 2011 amounted to $.73 a month (that's not a typo, I received less than one dollar a month as my last raise), it hardly seems worth the investment. These fees go up every year, as do the health care costs, but raises are often frozen for years at a time, so it's possible to make LESS money each year that you stay at UCSD.  As in corporate America, Department heads and management teams who make the fiscal decisions see employees only as numbers, and will immediately suggest furloughs and lay offs for the worker bees whenever there are budget cuts (which seems like every year), then collect bonuses that equal more than your average worker's annual salary for making those \"tough decisions.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, pay is not good at UCSD.

I am the lab manager, and provide the only research tech support for the entire lab as well as managing the animal colony which in the past has been the sole responsibility of another full time animal technician. I would say I am qualified to be classified as either a SRA 1 or SRA 2 (Staff Research Associate) for which I would be paid 5-6k more. However, I do believe the compensation for someone for the qualifications of a Lab Asst 2 is appropriate, as it only requires 1-2 years of experience and is probably targeted for someone who has recently graduated.\r\n \r\nThe main issue I have had on campus has been parking, the only time you can find parking easily is if you have a red A pass, which is only issued to professors and certain post-docs. Having a green B staff parking pass costs $80/month, which decreases your salary as well. Depending on the time you arrive on campus, even with a green B staff pass, it can be next to impossible to find parking, especially when school starts in the fall.\r\n\r\nI have run into some issues in the past with some people in various committees such as the Animal Care Program and Safety Officers. I imagine that these people have been in their positions for a long time and seem to be either very rude and impatient, even to people dealing with them for the first time, or extremely resistant to changes that would help make their jobs more efficient and effective.\r\n\r\nFinally, there doesn't seem to be very much room for career growth/improvement in the research lab environment. When you are a technician or lab manager the position seems to be one that is held for a year or two while the employee is figuring out their next step, and it is difficult to imagine a long term career plan in academia without going on to get a graduate degree, which can be a 5-7 year commitment while you will be unable to work and are given a paltry stipend."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "UCSD only cares about faculty", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "1 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Senior Development Engineer in La Jolla, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Taking leaves for vacation or medical reason is usually not a problem.

This may be a place for a worker just out of school to gain experience -- but I would not advise anyone else to take a position here. If you think you want the job to get your foot in the door, and believe that your hard work and dedication will surely get you a quick raise or promotion, you will be mistaken.
