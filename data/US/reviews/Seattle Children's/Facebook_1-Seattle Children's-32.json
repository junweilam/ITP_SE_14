Through scheduling and accommodating tech's time off people seemed to think the supervisor showed favoritism and I agree. She didn't seem to care much about me as an individual, I have an autoimmune condition which was still pretty new to me (I didn't know working in the lab would make my condition worse, though it did) and the only accommodation that was made for me was one that was available to everyone already (resting on a stool while working). When trying to reach out to their disability accommodations force I didn't receive a response for a couple months. Their disability protocol was pretty frustrating for me as someone without a visible disability. My body was in so much pain some days I would be in tears at the end of the day and the most that was said to me was I could take a couple minutes to sit down before getting back to my tasks instead of trying to navigate an easier way for me to complete them or having me do tasks that were easier on my body which could have easily been delegated. The manager used me as an example to persuade higher ups to work out a 4-day work weeks (10 hours) instead of 5 day (8 hour shifts) without really talking through if that would be beneficial for me, as I think it was a system she had been trying to get going for awhile. Aside from myself, when talking with my coworkers at the time most people seemed pretty burned out and unable to fully recover from work on their rest days, even when the extra \"3-day weekend\" was implemented. It was pretty difficult to get to work because there was no on campus parking except for weekends where you would have to pay $5 to park. I walked 30 minutes to the light rail and took the Children's shuttle at the UW light rail station to get to work everyday, so my 10 hour days turned into 12 hours. Overall, it just really wasn't worth it working there. Aside from my own health barriers the job just became my whole life and the weekends were spent recovering from working so that I could work again the next week (coworkers agreed this felt similar to them). One person quit a little before me and another person said they would if they didn't have to support their family with the job. I took a $5/hour pay decrease to leave the work environment I was in and have a better commute. I'm someone who has worked 3 other jobs and stayed at them for between 2-4 years so I am not typically one to jump around. That said, I am surprised I even lasted 6 months there."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good Benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Family Advocate/Case Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well known, supportive community, help others, great benefits", "cons": "Difficult management structure, lack of training guidelines for supervisors and managers"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Mixed bag", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great coworkers, great patients, decent benefits.", "cons": "CNAs are treated like expendable bodies by management and staffing, get low pay, and get stretched assignments so you're running all day to make sure cares get done.

Unfortunately, if you are looking for a professional group of people to go to when you have an issue, you will get squat. Favoritism is the logo in the department, and you will have to know someone personally in the department to make things move forward. I personally had \"Normal\" performance issues with my staff, and I tried to reach out to HR and I got nothing back. They take ages in responding back, and most of them are on paid or maternity leaves. So, if you have a case or an employee that you worked with one of them on, GOOD LUCK cause you will be following up with a new HR person every time. Very time consuming and unprofessional.\r\n3.\tThey hire Front End Staff just to fill a place and to have a body. No qualifications or experience review. This will cause you a lot of issues if you are trying to get high production because you will be constantly correcting errors, cleaning messes and imploring HR to intervene.\r\n4.\tSome Front End Staff will have personal relationships with managers and even directors. So, if you try to touch any of their beloved staff, they will step on your face. They don't understand the word hierarchy. So, a word of advice, if you want to last, try to kiss the butts of those favored by management even if they are at a lower pay-grade or position than you.\r\n5.\tAs a leader who worked in several leadership positions in top organizations, I was shocked with the poor management in the department. There was a lack of transparency and almost zero experience from my manager. My manager's opinions and decisions were always clouded with the favorite staff opinions which caused a complete lack of decisiveness. That created a lot of tension between staff because they see some of their co-workers being favored and not held accountable for any errors, while they get crussified whenever they make the slightest mistake. I did my best to stand for the right thing and do what's ethically right, but I was met with my manager reprimanding me to \"Tone it down\". Before I resigned, all my staff implored me to change my mind, but I did what I had to do to get away from the nightmare.\r\n6.\tThe Current CEO got a huge backlash because of the bacteria discovered on the walls of the operating rooms. We used to receive ORDERS from our managers to never talk about this to the press (which can be understandable because they don't wanna get sued), but still shows the complete lack of transparency as they used to give us the orders without any explanation or updates. They hold events to preach about equity and open mindedness, but it's all bogus. None of these concepts are actually implemented in the daily operations.\r\n7.\tMy dept. is currently being sued by a former manager. That manager was exposed to the same level of unprofessionalism and unethical practices, so they decided to sue. I think it's sad but at the same time, Karma was there I guess for me and that manager.\r\n8.\tRight now the dept. is struggling with staffing and revenue because of all the poor decisions and the insanely high turnover. \r\n9.\tDiscrimination due to religion and color is unfortunately there. Some people in my departement were being bullied or made fun of due to their religion or ethnicity.\r\n10.\tThe whole organization relies heavily on donations from big names (Like The Costco Family and many others), so you have to understand that this is the main way they make their money. That is why keeping appearances is a huge part of their budget, even if it means that other areas that desperately need reform will be buried and forgotten.\r\n11.\tI have to be fair because other depts like Finance have excellent managers and directors, so I'm not generalizing."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best of the best", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "30 May 2021", "job_title": "Senior Program Coordinator in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Room to grow, promote within, amazing benefits, benefit equity, work life balance, care about employees", "cons": "Disjointed working across departments, systemic health racism"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Senior Admin Assistant", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 May 2021", "job_title": "Senior Administrative Assistant in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work that is being done to change the culture has been great but will take time.
