In addition, the University is very generous with sick time, at fifteen days per year. After two years of employment, if an employee needs to take extended medical leave, they have 26 weeks available to do so. I have heard of women using this time after childbirth. In talking about great benefits the University offers, I must mention the tuition support they offer.

All in all, the as a University employee, you really feel you're being taken care of.", "cons": "The politics and the snail's pace that things get done can be trying.

Therefore, it is hard to make plans and have hard deadlines in place to complete projects.

It can be hard to keep momentum going due to the culture that's in place, and I often feel like my professional wheels are spinning.
