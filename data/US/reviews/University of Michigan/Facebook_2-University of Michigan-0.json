Bullying is rampant and is quickly learned as the only way of getting ahead, so staff will destroy each other to survive by amusing their \"masters\" with their mimicry. The bullying is felt in merciless rants and destructive verbal assaults that are used to ruthlessly destroy innocent staff in the most extreme imbalance of power, just because they can. We can smell the \"bitterness\" on an assistant dean's breath a mile away. Yet, he still gets to keep a job, making everyone below him miserable for decades. Staff have no human rights as deans and faculty can make false allegations without facts, without accountability, but with impunity. HR is not there to help the common person. Don't even think about going through the useless channels to report abuse. It will be used to get rid of the witnesses, not the problem."

A lot of the people who somehow ended up in management will stay there forever because they are the only ones who keep getting promoted (eg, from manager to senior manager to director to executive director, even though their job duties remain mostly the same) and their pay continues to go up even though they are resistant to change and insist on doing things the way they\u2019ve always been done to the detriment of the students. Employees not in management roles rarely, if ever, get promoted or get pay increases beyond cost of living (honestly, you\u2019re lucky if you even get that). You can get a perfect performance review for years, be told that your contributions are valuable, etc. but the university will claim poverty and not reward your contributions with more than a pat on the back, despite increasing tuition costs and record enrollment. They will, however, increase your workload or level of responsibility.\r\n\r\nService unit employees are generally treated poorly by the colleges and enrollment management. Their ideas are not valued and they are not treated as strategic partners but rather as people who were hired to do whatever the deans and senior leadership of other departments tell them to do. There is also so much organizational drama and office politics slow everything down and make day-to-day work life miserable.\r\n\r\nI did genuinely like some of the people I worked with but the feeling of \u201cwe\u2019re a big happy family\u201d is hard to swallow when you reflect on the way you were treated once you go to an organization where you actually are valued. I realized that I had experienced employer Stockholm syndrome, as I often defended the poor treatment and pay by buying into and repeating the lies told by management.\r\n\r\nI also heard from several students and prospectives that their experiences dealing with certain departments on campus were frustrating and discouraging. Disorganized departments with poor customer service are turning prospectives away and thus turning away tuition dollars. But when you try to tell anyone in a leadership position about this, they don\u2019t listen or are too ineffective to fix the issue."
