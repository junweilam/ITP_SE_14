They are not bad people; they just have an illness that affects their behaviors.  Sometimes they are angry; but it goes away very soon.  Due to the care and concern of the staff, they are well taken care of.\r\nAt times, there are some staff who have bad attitudes and they don't stay long here.  I guess that explains the negative comments on this page about Northlake.  They just must not have given it a chance.
