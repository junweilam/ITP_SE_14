It\u2019s just monotonous work. I didn\u2019t learn anything or grow in my career there.  Departments are very siloed. Of all the managers, VPs, and Directors I met there, only a handful were qualified to be in the roles they were, and they should have been higher level than they were at but most likely would never be promoted. The company just needs to enter this century. Employees need to be allowed to have voices and opportunities to grow the company and push it forward, as well as develop themselves professionally. The BayCare health insurance is limited to their own BayCare network and it was AWFUL. Worst doctors ever. Prepare to lose every good doctor you\u2019ve used because they won\u2019t be in the BayCare network. Coverage is terrible also. You\u2019ll pay a ton in uncovered medical expenses. It was the worst insurance I\u2019ve ever had. Another con is the lack of young people there. Most employees are in their 50\u2019s and above. No maternity leave - you have to use your PTO. But they\u2019ll tell you they have paid maternity leave because they consider your PTO paid leave (2 weeks per year).

Using your brain is frowned upon; speaking your mind can get you terminated. After a short time, team members either quit (and I saw MANY go) or they adapt to the toxic environment by squashing their feelings and \"drinking the koolaid.\" The marketing executive team are not just poor leaders, they are extremely insecure and will throw you under the bus with a smile. Before BayCare, I was an exemplary and happy employee, and I have once again regained that with my exit. But, while I was there, I was entirely miserable. I just could not extinguish the thought that my brain and opinions were, in fact, valuable.

The management however, is terrible and makes the work atmosphere dismal with low morale. Very high employee turnovers with factory like conditions and wages that are not guaranteed. They send you home early without pay daily. They rush and create unsafe working environments continuously. This not for profit cares about its record profit. Profit that will make you question the competency of the surgical and hospital administrations.   \r\n\r\nThe majority of scrubs worn in surgery are not laundered by the hospital. Industrial laundries reach temperatures that kill many germs found in blood, feces, and bodily fluids. That's how most hospital linen is cleaned. Instead, more profit is made by letting employees take their hospital attire scrubs home to clean in the family wash that does not reach required temperatures. Kindly ask any hospital employee on the front line of patient care, how their hospital cloths are washed and why? How often are they washed? Is it a machine? By hand? At all? Is the infection you and your loved one maybe fighting a result of this?  \r\n\r\n\"Immediate use\" sterilization (formerly \"flashing\") is used daily in their OR as a way of processing surgical equipment. This is recommended to be used in emergencies only by most organizations. Several steps of the decontamination and dry cycles of processing surgical equipment are removed by immediate use to ensure quick turnovers of cases without having to purchase more equipment. Imagine the equipment being used on a loved one that was inside another patient less than 60 minutes prior not going through the normal routine of decontamination, assembly, sterilization and cooling. This is not good. You can see if this has happened to you or a loved one by looking at the surgical report prepared by the operating room RN. Immediate use & infection have direct correlation to one another.  Ask if a certified infection control practitioner is on hand to witness this stuff. \r\nWould not recommend this place for employment in surgical services or surgery. If you do, at least prepare for leaving it in a few months as a precaution. \r\nPlease beware.  If there was ever a place needed to demonstrate why Nurses unions are required, this is the place!
