The management is unlikely to change until they reach retirement age since they are so loyal to the company, but that means turnover is high since lower level employees are only staying long enough to get the experience added to their resume and then they are leaving for higher-paying work. Pay is also low, but that is expected with a non-profit organization. It's a great starting point from which to build your career."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Horrible Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jan 2014", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional (Full-Time) in Chapel Hill, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with the residents was a blast! They are some of the most honest, caring, amazing people I've ever met, even if working with them can be difficult at times. Every day a smile was put on my face by one resident or another. Most of my coworkers (at the ground level) were also great. It was just the management (or lack thereof) that got in the way.", "cons": "The management was AWFUL. Even though the direct support professionals (basically the lowest position on the totem pole) do basically the hardest and most important work (the actual day-to-day ground work with the residents - the actual teaching of skills and coping mechanisms and handling of crisis situations) they hardly get any recognition for just how important their work is and not nearly enough compensation (including pay & benefits) for how hard & vital the job is. In my experience with RSI, the management rarely consulted the ground staff and seemed to make decisions in a bubble. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the training was horribly inadequate and when I requested more/better training I was told that I should be able to figure things out on my own (like how to interact with unfamiliar residents in specific recurring situations) based on generalities given during the initial 2-day orientation session. This implies that there's a one-size-fits approach to supporting adults with developmental disabilities, which, if you've ever worked with adults with disabilities, you would know is simply false, if not disrespectful. The residents are unique individuals just like anyone else and should be treated as such. This SHOULD mean that if, as staff, you're going to have to interact with a particular resident in a recurring situation, you should be given adequate training for how to support them in that specific situation. This was not provided initially and when I asked for it to be provided, this negatively impacted my performance evaluation (which was over 6 months overdue to begin with, and referenced instances from my initial 3-month probationary period which no one had previously mentioned or addressed). And that's not even getting into the safety risks of lack of training with certain residents who have a tendency to become physically violent towards themselves and/or others if certain detailed procedures aren't followed properly.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who's moving back to the area and works in the field recently asked if I would recommend RSI as a place to work and my answer was an emphatic NO because of how awful the management was. At first I really liked working for RSI because, as mentioned above, I loved working with the residents, it was a reliable full time job with consistent hours (even if it meant getting up before dawn), and I could leave work at work and come home and still have a life. But the management got in the way of doing my job so often that I dreaded going in and eventually it started following me home. I would get home so exhausted and frustrated that I could barely do more than veg out in front of the tv for a few hours, eat dinner, and go to bed. So unfortunately I had to break my year-long contract (even though initially I could've seen myself staying indefinitely) and quit. It was an upsetting experience because I cared quite a lot about the residents and I miss them dearly half a year later. And what makes me even more sad is that I know I am not the only one who felt this way. Not only did I hear similar complaints made by my coworkers but RSI's horrid turnover rates should speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I did work for one of the day programs (LO) which seemed to be the most poorly managed area of the company. So perhaps working in a different area wouldn't be quite as bad (independent living, for instance). Still, my experience was so bad that I would NEVER recommend RSI as a place to work. I wish I could say otherwise for the sake of the residents but I can't. Perhaps if your only looking to be an intern or volunteer the poor management wouldn't be so damaging. But the bottom line is: They don't treat the employees on the ground well which means ultimately they don't treat the residents well either since it's the ground staff that do the day-to-day work with the residents."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent Work Environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Direct Support Coordinator in Chapel Hill, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent work environment,  supportive supervisors/directors.
