They do not give their teachers adequate planning time or lunch breaks. When the pandemic first happened, they forced 40 teachers from 3 centers to report to one building to watch 10 children between the different centers. They cared more about making us work than keeping us safe and protected during the pandemic. When we asked why we couldn't split up and physically distance at different centers, we were told they didn't want to contaminate the buildings. We were expendable and disposable, and now they are paying the price with their inability to hire people. And the teachers that are still there suffer the most because they can't hire anyone. \r\n\r\nIt's clear as a society how we value child care teachers but I expected a higher standard from the University.

In some departments (like my own) there is also the strongly suggested desire to see research/scholarship from non-tenure faculty.

The organic devision is regrowing right now, with fresh faculties. However the average graduation time was above 5 years, which was a little bit disturbing.

If you get an outside fellowship in other departments (life sciences), you get them in addition to your salary. In engineering, they pull your salary if you get a fellowship. If you take more than 5 years to defend, which many do, you have to pay several thousand dollars to graduate. You also get charged $500-600 a semester in class \"fees\" even when just doing research, even though all tuition is supposed to be covered, as promised in contracts. I was given a surprise bill for $600 the first day of classes when I started. Most engineering departments here are extraordinarily cheap and always looking to cut corners at the expense of students.
