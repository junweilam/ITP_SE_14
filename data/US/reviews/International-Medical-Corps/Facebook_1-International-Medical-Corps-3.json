There is a huge variation in salaries across the board. Be prepared to be undercut and undervalued throughout your tenure there.If you stay too long you will use your sense of self-worth--don't do it!\r\n-HR policies are dubious at best-- they exist only to protect the Organization's interests and those who form part of the inner circle and not the employee. \r\n\r\n-HR inner policies point towards hiring of third country nationals for field assignments over US Citizens regardless of if they are qualified to perform the job or not because it reduces the legal liability on the Organization.  Very sad to see how an Organization funded mostly by USG/ US tax payer dollars does not give Americans an equal shot at jobs."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Humanitarian work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Jan 2021", "job_title": "MHPSS Programmer Officer in Ankara", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Good Coordination, programming, advanced technical expertise", "cons": "there is not much cons"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Nutrition Supervisor I in Bertoua, Adamaoua", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Efficient organisation in health and nutrition aspects", "cons": "no known disadvantage for the organisation"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Rating International Medical corps", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Country Security Manager in Monrovia", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A very unique organization presently", "cons": "It is a good organization"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Jordan", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Field Program Officer in \u015eab\u1e29\u0101", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s positive feedback", "cons": "Bad management and Bad decisions"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Working with IMC", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Program Specialist, GBV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Global organization with sound technical knowledge in few areas.

The low morale makes it difficult to stay motivated or engaged, as many people (myself included) have a hard time seeing a future for themselves at the organization. I've heard of several staff who had negative experiences with HR. It seems there is a lack of transparency about HR policies and also general lack of transparency between those leading the organization and everyone else. Some departments are also fairly siloed; it would be beneficial to have more consistent interactions between departments to ensure that teams are working collectively and there are not duplicative efforts. Many of the organization's senior staff have been around for a long time - the lack of diversity in experience contributes to limited perspectives on how to get things done. The biggest challenge I encountered was that the organization has grown substantially in a short time but the processes and ways of doing business haven't changed to keep up with the growth. There's a very clear power struggle at the top of the organization - and at times it seems that this power struggle takes priority over making a true programmatic impact.

The CEO is clueless - no interaction with staff and no field visits. A few folks in place at the top run the show without understanding processes that would be normal in other INGOs, making poor decisions that disrespect, de-motivate, and demoralize the middle-level staff who really know their stuff.  I would agree with other commenters that most HQ staff are fed-up.  There is nepotism and a general feeling amongst staff that the org does not care about them.  I know numerous talented, hard-working, dedicated staff that have had run-ins with human resources that show they could care less about you. Dedicated, talented staff are dispensable - they'll just get someone else. Forget about having a career path here unless you don't know a thing/have no relevant experience, because then you will get a promotion (no really, this is happening even now I hear). I think they keep relying on their image in the field to keep afloat (keep HQ staff coming in) but sooner or later (perhaps through these glassdoor reviews) people may realize that this org is not worth it. HR does not want to hear what staff have to say or fix really broken issues.  There is no transparency in decision-making and HR decisions, and rules change depending on who you know. No transparency in hiring process with regard to salary ranges - they do not share salary ranges. Benefits, especially travel recovery leave and vacation, are deplorable. They are a humanitarian org that doesn't care about their employees. The organization is very disjointed as well, one arm doesn't work with the other arm and doesn't know what's happening it.  There are depts working on multiple fronts but not engaging together. There are senior, senior folks that don't work hardly at all/do as they please, don't engage within their teams, don't make needed changes, or make decisions in isolation (without taking feedback of those that know what their stuff). Human resources is overseen by finance - no balance of power.

This is commented upon and seemingly accepted by other staff. Numerous tiresome office rivalries and conflicts - I naively thought that this would be less of an issue at an NGO - I was wrong;\r\n\r\nManagement have little to no interest in providing career progression opportunities for staff. As a result of this (and the above) staff turnover is very high (don't just take my word for it - check out some ex-employees on LinkedIn to see how long the average tenure is - 1-2 years is common). My manager for example interrupted my Annual Review to take a call from her husband about an upcoming holiday  - and then spent 10 minutes discussing it whilst I sat there like a lemon;\r\n\r\nEverything is done in a very 'back of an envelope' way i.e. with little forethought, discussion or preparation.

One employee I stayed in touch with told me that she felt that working at IMC was like working for a family business;\r\n\r\nObscene waste of funds and donations on fripperies such as pointless foreign trips, expensive hotels or useless IT equipment. This is one of the reasons I no longer give money to charity;\r\n\r\nHuge pay differentials, often between staff doing the same job - there's a reason there's no payscale advertised on IMC's website. Pay for the less prestigious jobs is low and not enough to live on in London;\r\n\r\nHQ is in LA, which is just about the most awkward location possible given that the vast bulk of IMC's programmes are in Asia and Africa. For urgent matters this means hanging around way past your leaving time waiting for people to arrive to work in LA;\r\n\r\nLondon office location - who thought Canary Wharf, one of the dullest, most sterile parts of London - would be a good location for an NGO?

I certainly learned a few things at IMC, though dealing with the above day-in-day-out for well below the London living wage started making me extremely jaded and cynical so I eventually just quit. I'd like to think that IMC has changed radically since I left though somehow I doubt it. I notice that a good third to a half of the staff members who were there when I was have since left.

Most sadly, working at imc you can see many people whose performance is awful and/or are clearly incompetent being promoted and on the other side so many people who are excellent and have done a lot for Imc being neglected and/or ignored. So many people leave because they don't feel recognized or have no opportunities to grow after years at imc. Related to this, there is clearly some corruption or maybe if not corruption misbehavior when hiring people. It's clear some people who have more influence internally \"push\" for their favorite \"friend\" candidate to be hired, in some cases I saw interviews being conducted differently to advantage a specific candidate. In other cases you can see just bad attitudes or cultures toward even internal candidates, for example some people trying to influence against someone's recruitment just because of personal reasons and not professional.

As some mentioned above, under-qualified or careless senior management applies a secretive management style based on improvisation as far as operational decision-making is concerned, while personal favoritism concerning HR decisions (in some instances, of the lowest imaginable kind), in total disregard to merit or programmatic needs, allow all sorts of improbable characters to be affected to key regional or country roles, often against the advice of local management. I found it most frustrating when people I line-managed just bypassed to talk to their friends in HQ or the regional office and break all possible management and communication lines. This makes country and program management a nightmare, since no trust is ever possible. I\u2019ve never witnessed this in other American NGOs, where instead often the implicit motto you get is \u201cdo or die\u201d. With IMC, you won\u2019t even have the time to show that you can do, since you\u2019ll be basically spied upon from week one.\r\n\r\nInternal communication is awful, as is HR management. I was relocated for administrative reasons beyond my or IMC\u2019s control out of my base country to a third country (not my own country), but once it became clear it was not possible for me to resume work where I was originally posted, they rescinded my contract with a week\u2019s notice (under Christmas!) and even said I should pay my return fees myself to come and recollect my items! Ironically, just 6 months after a formal complaint and strong wording against the management, HR contacted me for another senior position, like no actualized HR records existed. Unfortunately, this means also that awful workers fired somewhere just turn up into the agencies sometimes in the future.\r\n\r\nPersonal rants aside, what is worst is that for an agency having a highly technical mandate, these \u201csenior managers\u201d parachuted from above by friendly supervisors at HQ come with limited technical background (especially in public health), arrogance and lack of diplomacy, severely affecting relations with both donors and country officials. One regional manager boasted once about having received several death threats in several countries, and she seemed to think it was actually a good thing and something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nIn short, if you\u2019re experienced, look for transparent management structures, a positive organizational culture, a like to work in public health in complex post-emergency or transitional contexts, don\u2019t go there. If you\u2019re just starting up, or you\u2019re an emergency cowboy/girl who cares little of HR support should something smelly hit the fan, or you just like health work so much that you couldn\u2019t care less of who manages you, and just think about doing your job, it can be a decently-paid option for a short/medium term."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst place I've ever worked", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can meet some nice people, but not at the higher levels.

I hesitate to say 'good people' however - staff seem to be promoted or deployed based on friendships and time spent with the organization, not actual skill and experience.

This is not a place to go if you want to grow and learn in your job.\r\n\r\nThis is the first NGO I have worked were I've seriously had to consider fraud and ethics in the workplace; some of the decision-making and behaviors I have witnessed are truly unacceptable.  Sometimes it is hard to tell if the lack of normal systems and experienced staff means bad decision-making is the result of genuine naivety or intentional disregard.\r\n\r\nIMC is focused on money, not people or quality.  Communications from senior management are non-existent, there are a high percentage of staff wondering if they have a job each morning.  Benefits for international staff were recently reduced, with no clear explanation or prior warning.  You actually need to attend a training session to be able to understand your payslip.

No use of strengths-based management styles. Unless you are a senior level officer, you are basically a secretary and will be treated as such. Many people in HQ offices are on-call all the time and have to take calls at ridiculous hours - absolutely zero respect for work-life balance and boundaries. Extremely high turn-over rates - most people seem to leave after a year. Many people in management who have zero skills and should not be managers, but they've simply been there the longest or are friends with the senior staff. Too much white saviorism from rich white people. Most of senior management is white - they use the overseas field staff to pad their diversity stats. Don't expect to afford to add healthcare benefits for your spouse or kids unless you are at least senior level - costs either $1400/month or $700 for the low plan with the $12K family deductible.
