Many of the staff have spent decades of their entire career there proving their commitment to the community. This is a great place for new graduates to gain great experience and learn from the experienced staff. I loved all of the Department Directors who often rolled up their sleeves to help staff when needed. Mostly, I loved that the leadership team was present and visible for the staff often rounding on night and weekend shifts to show a presence and check in. The cafeteria food was excellent, free parking and conveniently located in a vibrant and inclusive town. There is a nursing director who regularly bakes homemade treats and brings her treat cart around for the staff to enjoy. The support groups that the hospital offers to the community members are fantastic including disease management. The clinical ladder program for nurses and the shared governance were also fantastic. The tuition reimbursement for nursing degrees was the best around. The vacation time was generous.", "cons": "Competition in this area is a major reason for turnover with so many excellent healthcare systems in the greater Philadelphia area."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Hospital", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Phoenixville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small Town Hospital, everyone is super friendly.", "cons": "Worried they may close their doors or be bought out."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "In times of no Covid", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Nurse Manager in Phoenixville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small family like, middle management team oriented", "cons": "Understaffed, upper management not visible or easily accessible"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Decent", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Phoenixville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good staff to work With; resources are there for you as a meee grad nurse", "cons": "Poor staffing ratios which then cause high turn over rate: some equipment and supply issues"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Working as a Registar Phoenixville", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 May 2021", "job_title": "Registrar in Phoenixville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wide selection of shifts available", "cons": "Always short staffed, and over worked"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Staff is Really Committed to Patients & Community", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Director in Phoenixville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Staff becomes family.
