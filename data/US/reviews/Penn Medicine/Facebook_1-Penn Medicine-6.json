Hard to work on contracts when you don't have a database to store them.\n- No direction or help provided\n- vp is miserable and tries to lead by intimidation. \n- No training when you start. They give you 150+ contracts to complete before months end, along with ALL of the other work.\n- You will drown in work and they will never give you a helping hand.\n- They frown upon taking days off, even when necessary\n- No standard operating procedure manuals\n- They don't like change, so don't try to help\n- Average turnover by a Contract Manager at Penn is about 3-6months.\n- No career progression.\n\nBy far the worst career move I have made. Stay away, it's not worth it."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "good place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Medical Social Worker in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The hospital has a lot of great people to work with.", "cons": "The hospital doesn't have a lot of diversity in management positions."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Nursing Assistant in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great atmosphere for learning and supportive coworkers", "cons": "Low pay compared to other hospitals in the area"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Terrible management in family practice", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cherry Hill, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Alright pay & great health benefits", "cons": "Management micro manages, more tasks on one person than necessary, they don\u2019t care about their employees mental health,"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Primary Care Physician in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good place to work and good people", "cons": "poor pay, below national average"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great entry level", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Patient Service Associate in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent training and good work environment", "cons": "Very little breaks and time off available"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Wonderful company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Clinical Service Associate in Radnor, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Health benefits, continuing education bonus", "cons": "yearly raise is minimal @ 2%, often your pay is based on the department you are working for so it is not set across the health system"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Coordinator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Jan 2022", "job_title": "New Patient Coordinator in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for if you are okay with doing the same thing for the rest of your career with Penn.

There can be a lot of pressure to uphold company's standards and patients are very demanding due to the reputation of the company, their expectations can be high and they can have a tendency to forget that they are not the only patient we are treating and some tasks require patience.
