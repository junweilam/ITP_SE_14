The clinic first opened its doors in rented space at the local dog pound. Over the past four decades, the clinic has grown to five locations in Vista and Oceanside. The new Women's Center at Vale Terrace opens in January, 2012.  One of the reasons why I like working with Vista Community Clinic is because the clinic gives free medical and dental visits to the homeless. I want to work at a company that isn't profit driven, but cares about making a difference in people's lives. Patients appreciate us and are happy we're in the neighborhood. Anybody may walk through our door, but we focus on providing care to those who are facing tough times, either financially, socially or culturally. And in this economic climate, who isn't facing tough times? I like working for a company that strives to make a positive impact on its community. Vista Community Clinic is here for those who lose their health insurance due to a job loss, divorce or other event. At some point in life, most people experience a loss or interruption of health insurance and it's a scary time. Vista Community Clinic also helps patients enroll in public assistance programs. I like working for a company that is community-oriented. The clinic doesn't discriminate. Patients will find many different programs available, such as HIV testing and AIDS programs, cyber education for teens, alcohol, tobacco and drug prevention programs, programs for keeping kids healthy, maternal and child care, a diabetes program and several others. One of the best reasons I like working at Vista Community Clinic is interacting with patients. How many people get to hold babies on the job!? It's so cool!", "cons": "We see over 57,000 patients a year and our days are busy, every minute. It's never boring! But it can be tiring. The workload is always heavy and there is never a shortage of sick people needing help, re-assurance or comfort. I think the staff is gracious to patients. I've been a patient myself and Iiked how the medical assistant checked in with me to give me the ETA of the doctor, who was running late because he was giving extra time to a patient who needed him. One of the downsides of working here has been the parking situation because of construction. However, that problem is now being remedied with a new parking structure and we're excited about that."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Room for improvement, vast improvement", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Dec 2008", "job_title": "Manager in Vista, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "With a turnover rate of 28% in 2007 and Upper Management (Directors) proud of the fact that turnover decreased to 20% in 2008, it is increasingly interesting to list reasons to work for this company.\r\n\r\nMost turnover personnel enter the company with no experience or training, stay while getting trained and then jump at the opportunity of a better paid position with a different company.
