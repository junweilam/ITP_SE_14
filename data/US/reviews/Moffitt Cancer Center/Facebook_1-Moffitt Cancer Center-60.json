The physician turnover rate is so high that some patients end up seeing 6 different doctors (of the same specialty) within 1-2 years. That is very bad for patient care. The physician management and HR look the other way when unprofessional behavior and even frank verbal abuse occur. In my opinion, this is a very bad place to work for junior faculty (there is no mentorship at all and you are expected to see private practice numbers of patients while doing your research on the nights and weekends, resulting in routine 80+ hour work weeks) and for women. There are very few women in leadership (both physician and otherwise). It is clear that senior management does not care for their employees and focuses primarily on financial outcomes.

Moffitt provides research seminars several times per week which are highly educational especially for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, you have a great opportunity to because educated with top notch cancer research, BUT you have to be willing to put up with the horrible/toxic social environment there.", "cons": "There were so many cons about working there, I will do my best to try and list them all. I resigned as soon as my contract ended and already had another job lined up. First off, they forced me to be shuttled in on a bus from my parking for 1 year before they gave me parking \"near\" the  building I work in. Even then, it was still a block walk and I had to pay $1000/ year for the parking space. Riding a junky bus for a year before and after work when you have a PhD is absolutely insulting and unacceptable. It was horrible waiting for the shuttle bus in the rain, or when it was 95 deg F, and when I was tired from a long day at work. The social work environment is toxic. People are all stuck up and snobby. Barely anybody is friendly and people don't even look at each other in the hallway, let alone simply smile or god forbid act civil and say \"hi\". Many professors have MAJOR superiority complexes. When you go to seminars, only the high up people are (unofficially) allowed to sit at the front of the room. It's ridiculous and asinine to exclude and discourage young fresh minds such as grad students and postdocs from sitting in the front so that they can more readily be involved in the talk. The research equipment is severely lacking and what is there is always broken and takes forever to finally get fixed. You have to walk to different buildings and different floors just get an experiment done, and because they have way too many people using a small amount of equipment, a lot of times the machine is already taken when you get there with your samples ready. The equipment is often dirty, old, and/or broken. A ton of unprofessional and unacceptable things happen behind the scenes, but even when informed they just brush it all under the rug so the professors face no consequences and know they can basically get away with anything. They are also a greedy company. They say they are nonprofit, and pay the researchers crap for salary, but then I frequently saw doctors that work there pulling out of their cushy parking spots in their Maseraties! (ridiculous). Another example of their greediness, they make you pay back taxes on your own health insurance and daycare. When I did my taxes, I had to pay several thousand dollars of my tax money for my Moffitt health insurance and daycare. At most companies (that are not greedy) the company is suppose to cover the insurance tax for their employees, but nope not at Moffitt. Its the only place I've ever worked that did that. Unfortunately, most of the people who work there are way more concerned with their social status, how they are dressed, and what everyone looks like than actually doing good cancer research and helping people. Its sad and pathetic to me. I honestly felt like I was back in high school working there, with cliques and popularity contests. On top of that, you can constantly see the high up people having their expensive \"receptions\" on the bottom atrium floor with their fancy foods and top shelf liquors/drinks. Really!? Maybe if you spent less money on your expensive parties for your suits and ties, you could invest that money into your subpar research facility to fix all the broken equipment and get more equipment so its not always taken when people need to get their experiments done. Poor management for sure. Basically, the research sector of Moffitt is just for show so that they can get NIH/NCI comprehensive cancer center designation, but they really only care about the hospital sector because they charge the patients so much money for treatment that's where they make all their money. They are super bureaucratic and treat you like a number not a human being. Forced annual fluhots (there was talk of biannual when I left), forced blood tests and drug tests for preemployment even when you don't work with patients. Working at Moffitt was a horrible experience and everyday I couldn't wait to not work there anymore. It's not worth the toll it takes on your mental sanity, especially for such crap salary. Don't waste your time, there are way better places to work.
