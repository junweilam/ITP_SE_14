Management rewards high performers with more work and rude treatment instead of a raise in pay or a compliment.  The insolent employees are not reprimanded; they are ignored and left to continue being useless.  This places a greater burden on the high performer (this has gone on for years).  Employees are lied to on a daily basis.  Many managers act unreasonable. I met people from every single department in all 3 hospitals that were completely miserable because of the job.\r\n\r\nEmployees are not treated with respect at all.  There is a lot of \"in fighting\" between departments as well as different sects of departments.  The upper crust management really treats the rest of staff like garbage. I used to have to attend the \"management rah rah rally meetings\" and its pretty cut-throat.  There is constant, high rate of turn over..management knows this and doesn't care.  HR is only there to protect the interests of the organization.  When people leave or are fired, there is no sense of urgency in rehiring.  Instead they place the extra work on the rest of the \"team\" to see if it can be handled or not.  It usually takes anywhere from 4-9 months to rehire.  Some departments were great with patient care..some other departments not so much.  Anyone that works or has worked there can attest to all of this.
