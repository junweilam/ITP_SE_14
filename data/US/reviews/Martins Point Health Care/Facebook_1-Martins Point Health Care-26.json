Yep.", "cons": "Everything. Leadership cancels 1x1 almost all the time. There is hardly any guidance, or mentoring given to staff. They provide no feedback besides lower your call time. I have only spoken with my supervisor for 10 minutes in the last 6 months due to answering high volume calls. They do not mention that the high volume last ALL YEAR LONG. There is absolutely no down time to what so ever. Callers are always angry over the wait time and take it out on staff. The queue gets up to 90 plus people at a time and the wait time is easily over an hour to speak with a rep, and once they get a rep they let their frustration out on them (when the staff is just as frustrated). You literally are glued to your desk answering call after call after call as soon as you start your day to the end. Lack of information and resources given to reps so we can provide accurate answers. Training is only educational for Medicare and the basics of the plans and then you are thrown to the wolves not even knowing how to perform the actual job. Not to mention that members tear into for not knowing the answer you are desperately looking for. You only have 3 ten minute breaks for the whole day and those you must use to go to the bathroom. Leadership slashed our bonuses in half this year when it was needed MOST while keeping theirs the same. The technical problems and phone issues to top it off are absolutely terrible and it\u2019s a company wide known issue. There is about 20 different systems that you are required to use because they will not upgrade to a more advanced system. It takes about ten minutes to sign into all these systems each morning which we are not allowed to put on our time cards. Thats an hour of OT each week we don\u2019t get paid. We are also now expected to work until the queue is empty or close too, even past our clock out time to help manage the queue for the closers, so the lack of empathy for our personal lives /plans is right out the door. Leadership can\u2019t keep it fully staffed because of the turn around due to all these issues above along with the terrible pay. People at Walmart are starting with higher pay, less stress, and they seem to refuse to adjust it even with the inflation at an all time high. People usually quit after a few weeks or a few months. SAVE YOURSELF and YOUR MENTAL HEALTH and do not work here! Also, may I add that the disorganization is unbearable. On top of everything else, they do not even provide you with the equipment needed to do the job at home when they are the ones sending you home. I need two monitors and I only got one, so I had to get a stand prop for my laptop to use as a second tiny monitor. I also had to buy my own headset because the one provided did not work. I have had to buy multiple headsets now. I stay at this job only to help the people calling in who need help. This company also presents its self as a great place to work but if you work on the phones you must work all holidays and never get to participate in fun activities that other departments may be involved in. There is also no room for growth besides answering more calls. Lastly, the supervisors are suppose to help staff manage the call volume when the queue gets insane, but I have not seen that happen for a long time now because they are to busy interviewing to fill positions they will soon by empty again.
