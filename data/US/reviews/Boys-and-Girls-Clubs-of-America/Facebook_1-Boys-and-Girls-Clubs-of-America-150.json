But, the lack of feedback was discouraging at times. My superior had vaguely mentioned to me about writing a report each quarter- although no one had ever done so in this position, therefore there were no guidelines for this. Now, I have no problem with creating my own format- but some feedback would have been nice. I simply adapted my own report system- and turned it in- it was always accepted and I was told it was \"good\", but that was it. In fact, when I left this job I felt very confused on their opinion of me. I had never been reprimanded or asked to change something I had done, but I had also never been told that I was doing a great job. So, when they approached me this previous year- asking for me to come back and ranting on how well I did- I was pleasantly but VERY surprised- because I had no clue how they felt about my work performance."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Its a good teen, young twenty job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 May 2011", "job_title": " in Petaluma, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "they work around your schedule.

While I was working for BGCA, I always had this feeling of resentment and I didn't realize why until after I left. \r\n\r\nWhen I was working as a site coordinator, which is essentially the person who runs and manages a program at an off site location, I had so many responsibilities and so few hours to manage them. I had to manage and supervise my staff, I had to program plan, I had to deal with parent communication, managing child behavior (and I had many difficult behaviors, a lot of the children should not even have been allowed to be there, and this is coming from someone who's career has been working with behavioral children), I had to follow and ensure my staff was following protocols, I had to discipline, all while trying to maintain a safe and growth fostering environment... all for $17 an hour.\r\n \r\nI also was not provided with time during my scheduled work hours to manage all of these responsibilities. I will say there was never an issue with me adding hours to my time sheet for program planning, they were always happy and willing to compensate my time for the extra hours I put in, which can't be said of most organizations, however... I signed up for a part time 25 hour a week non benefited part time position and usually was putting in 30-35 and I was in school at the time, so I genuinely did not have the time and the program suffered a lot because it, and this made me feel terrible but I was not informed of the immensity of the work I would have to do outside of program hours, that is something that they need to make more clear in the hiring process. I will say that the staff there was all pretty supportive, but there expectations for a part time staff that they aren't paying super well are far too high. \r\n\r\n I'm a hard worker, but they just asked too much out of me for how much they were giving back to me. I know that they discount many memberships, and do a lot for the community but at my site kids were paying roughly $150 per week for care and our program had about 40 kids, so they were making $6,000 a week off of the program that I ran completely independently from them and I got about $350 bucks a week, that feels like short changing your staff to me. I understand there are overhead costs, but I was also aware of all of the grants and donations they received, they need to pay their staff better IMO.\r\n\r\n It's an organization that is literally run by direct care staff, so to not invest in them is to not invest in your program. Their programming suffers because they are essentially depending on the fact that people will be so emotionally fulfilled by the position that and that their fulfillment will make the job worth it, and listen I love working with children, I love being a positive person in their life, but I also have bills to pay and my own sanity to keep in check. I will say all of the management was super kind and supportive, however at the end of the day I gave so much of myself to that program, and I wasn't compensated fairly and regardless of if their mission is amazing, it's not right."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "In the land of Oz and Kids", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Director in Fort Worth, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loved the Job and mostly the relationships you build with the children.", "cons": "Needs a professional management overall especially in Administration current president does not have the workers best interest at heart.

They drop off their kids and drive off before you can do anything about it. This is more something that reception and full-time staff deals with, but I do think it has a negative impact on the children involved and staff morale.\r\nIf you already have experience working with kids, the \"curriculum\" and training workshops might be a snooze fest for you. Over my 2-year stint with them I think I endured the same professional development trainings 3-4 times.\r\nWe were asked to do a lot with little to no staff, financial, or resource support.\r\nJust restocking the first aid kit always seemed to be a financial burden, much less getting supplies for art and science projects.\r\nColleagues come in a wide range of competence. Once, I walked in on another staff playing video games while the kids sat and watched. He considered this to be an \"activity\". While I and other staff would spend hours putting together forensics labs on our own time,  with our own money, he played video games. And we were paid at the same hourly rate.\r\nThough the company policy is 1 staff to 25 kids, that ratio was often... optimistic.\r\nSeemed to be an awkward \"us and them\" fmentality between part-time and full-time staff. There seemed to be a lot of company events in which the full-time staff were knowledgeable of, but little or no effort was given to notifying part-time staff.\r\nI was often doing my boss' job, just without the salary and benefits. It was quickly apparent he had no idea what he was doing the majority of the time or he was outright neglecting his duties and I had to pick up the slack.\r\nDon't expect consistent hours. I was working 35 hours a week. I went to work on a normal Monday, and suddenly my hours were cut to 10 a week due to budget issues. So I filled my time with other jobs. Then a few months later they began asking me to pick up additional hours because they were understaffed. At that point, I couldn't as I had already picked up other jobs to supplement my lost hours.\r\nI endured a lot of verbal abuse from disgruntled parents and kids while working at reception. Which is fine to a degree. I get that people are sometimes sensitive where money and child-rearing is concerned.
