A lot of offices are also strangely committed to making staff work on-site even if they actually don't need to be on campus to carry out their work. If you're not going to pay staff enough to live comfortably in the Providence metro area, then make it easier for them to live farther away. You also have to pay for parking on campus even though public transportation to the campus is subpar at best.
