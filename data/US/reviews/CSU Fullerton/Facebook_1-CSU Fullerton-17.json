Perhaps the strangest (and unjust) feature of the history department was /is the so-called K2 classes. These are classes with an enrollment of 115 students. If the class filled above 90 students, lecturers got paid for teaching two classes. If it fell below 90 (say 75) they were only paid for one class.

Honestly, this place runs off of favoritism/who you know and not by merit/work ethic/years of experience/etc. Hired an older white male with no experience on campus for top tier pay because he was married to a former dean, counterparts who do same work paid way less, analysts above this position paid the same or LESS than this individual. This is one of many stories on campus. \r\n No real training for jobs when hired and many staff members (again because of being jaded) do not want to assist new people on campus. Typical responses I've heard are \"No one helped me when I first came on and I'm not either\", \"I don't get paid enough to do that\".\r\nBoss/chair/dean/management usually change pretty quickly (3-10 years), if your boss sucks you have a 50/50 to hope for a better one in a few years. You might get a worse one too.\r\nIf you are not a go-getter it will be hard for you to succeed since training is hard to come by and usually it is hard for people to figure out what their job even is because managers also don't know and definitely don't know how to train them. \r\nVery hard to get a raise without the union, most people need to move positions to get more money on campus and even then it's usually the bare minimum offered.\r\nYearly evaluations are rated at a 1-5 type category with 3 being \"satisfactory\". All management has been told that satisfactory means you are doing everything exactly as you should and have been told not to rate staff higher than that category, if they do they need to provide more information and fill out more paperwork as to why you are giving higher than a 3. This is because if you hit an overall category of 5 you can request a raise yourself and HR cannot deny the request; but it doesn't explain why management can't give a 4 because although you can initiate a raise request with an overall 4 rating, HR can deny those.
