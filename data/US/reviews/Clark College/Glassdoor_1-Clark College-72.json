My manager were very hands off and trusted me with my program. My managers were also forgiving with mistakes and were always available for help when you needed it. \r\nMy managers and office were extremely flexible with taking time off, taking sick time, and general work schedule options. \r\nOne great perk for all full time employees is the free tuition waver. Most managers are flexible on your schedule when wanting to take a class on campus during working hours. \r\nAll of my coworkers were nice and caring. I hardly had an issue with the people that I worked with day to day. I felt like I had an office family. \r\nMay consider this a pro or not, but Clark is extremely slow with work. All day every day except maybe a few weeks out of every year before a new quarter starts. Clark's \"crazy busy\" days are probably equivalent to a slow day in the private sector. Things would get very boring very fast. \r\nMedical benefits are very competitive.", "cons": "Upper management. The upper management in my office and across Clark makes higher education look bad (mostly because they all have higher educations themselves). Some are hired with very little to no skill set in the field that they were hired for. When the top has been complaining about how bad department leadership is by multiple employees, they just ignore it.\r\nThings move extremely slow at Clark. Mainly because of my earlier point that most upper management is very incompetent in the field they have been placed in.\r\nClark has gone through a lot of bad media periods about racial inclusion issues. Being a Hispanic women, all I have noticed at Clark is a loud outspoken distaste for 'white men'. Usually these would be words spoken directly from a department leadership's mouth in front of white male employees. \"Why do you need a raise? White men have been privileged for so long, they don't need a raise\". This was said to my coworker who is a white male and who is also a great hardworking employee. Working at Clark has made me experience what real life racism really is. I cannot tell you how many employees talk about how wrong this is to each other but yet do not have the courage to speak out and appear to be going against the 'inclusive environment'. \r\nPay is extremely low. I cannot imagine how someone with kids lives on the salary. The salary is not competitive with other schools. \r\nThere is a cap at how much you growth, learn and expand as an employee at Clark. Work is usually the same thing everyday unless you are in management. Not a place to grow or stay if you are wanting to advance in your career. At a certain point, it becomes wasted time, if you are someone who is wanting to grow."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Security Officer position", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jul 2010", "job_title": "Security Officer in Vancouver, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is one of the best part time jobs I've ever had.
