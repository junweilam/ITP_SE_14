Trauma-informed care is a facade from management. Executive leadership is notorious for bullying and manipulating staff for their own gain. They offer a seemingly compassionate ear to later weaponize trauma against you in order to keep you quiet and complacent. If you find yourself unsure about taking the job, ask about the turnover rate. Look at the privilege and whiteness of executive leadership, and compare it to the population they generally serve. And ask yourself why leadership earns over one million dollars in profit (check the nonprofit tax returns), but they\u2019re only offering 40-50k to therapists. Leadership expects staff to stay in unsafe, traumatizing environments without any administrative support, and then wonder why most clinicians resign within the year. This cycle will continue as long as current leadership is in charge."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Positive work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Contractor", "job_date": "24 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Mental Health Therapist in Brook Park, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Caring and passionate culture, knowledgeable staff, allow independence, focus on growth of the individual and company.", "cons": "Commission based positions do not include benefits"}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
