(If you're a practicing therapist you know how unrealistic this is when you're trying to provide quality pt care. They use EPIC and its a monster at consuming all your documentation time.\r\n-It's all about productivity and $$$. It's only the illusion of patient care and employee satisfaction.\r\n- Clinical ladder = small pay raise for more work when your schedule is already jammed\r\n- Will cut your hours and mess with your schedule to boost their productivity\r\n- Poor patient follow through with same therapist. They end up on 5 different PT schedules due to lack of availability on your schedule however your schedule is full of patients you have never seen before. Doesn't make sense.\r\n- They say the benefits are great here but I don't see they're value.\r\n- A lot of shuffling around paperwork and hurdles to jump through as management one being pt satisfaction surveys that we depend upon to get a small bonus at the end of the year.\r\n-Styrofoam everything.

One of the main reasons why I loved going to work (besides having the opportunity to help people) is to be with my fantastic coworkers.", "cons": "The supervisors in the transportation department did some pretty unfair things to the employees. For example, they would only hire \"per-diem\" workers to speed up the hiring process and avoid giving benefits yet make the employees work just as much as a part-time (or even full-time) employee. The official process of per-diem is to call whenever a full or part-time employee cannot go into work and that employee fills in the gaps. However, in the transport department, per-diem employees were scheduled like any other employee with no flexibility to their schedule. In my opinion, it was extremely difficult to switch or ask for time off, even though I was not technically supposed to be on the schedule to begin with. I think this process is just a way for the hospital to save money? But that's only a guess on my part.\r\n\r\nAlso, salary-wise: $10.25 is not nearly enough for the exposure patient transporters have with patients. Management argues that it isn't a \"patient contact job,\" yet what have I been doing all day? Lifting patients, assisting PCAs, CNAs, technicians, and nurses do their jobs, and I am responsible for their life while they are solely in my care? And if they are on a telemetry pack, I am responsible that it is being read correctly by the monitor technician? $10.25 is petty. A person folding clothes at a mature women's apparel store makes that much without that sort of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThis job is very physically demanding. It's pretty much hard labor in medical form. Future employees must consider whether pushing a 100 lb bed with a 300 lb person on top across the hospital is right for them. This job is not for the faint of heart (or body). Also, at this specific location, management demands efficiency. So sitting for a minute between patients is nearly impossible. The end result if you do? Write-up. they track your whereabouts like a hawk.\r\n\r\nTransferring from this department to others is way too difficult. I know several coworkers of mine who had nursing degrees and ACTUAL JOBS with Memorial but the supervisors would not release them from the department.\r\n\r\nIf these cons don't seem terrible to you, then by all means, go for it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great hospital overall", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Sept 2016", "job_title": "RN Tele in Fort Lauderdale, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great teamwork, very busy and fast paced, use tiger text to communicate with physicians, good technology available, lots of classes", "cons": "PARKING I have to get there at 545 to park and take a shuttle over and same when I leave.

Your daily routine is composed of  random foot and mobile patrol of the campus , securing the helipad landing zone for incoming helicopters and assisting the flight crew down into the trauma bays with patients. Add that  to the duties  of securing sensitive areas ,  responding to emergency situations ,  monitoring the CCTV and alarms in the state of the art Dispatch Center just to name a few. The staff to work  with are great along with a great security director. Pay and benefits are excellent and may I mention the pension is pretty good.
