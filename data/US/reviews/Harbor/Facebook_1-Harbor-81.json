It's nice to be celebrated and every so often they have a \"Harbor-ized\" giveaway's for us to use.  Typically very practical for office use. \r\n\r\nBonus of the benefits, because I only have myself on my insurance and not my family, Harbor pays for my insurance and I get a cash pay out every month in my check for only having myself on the plan.

They are a non-profit but operate as a for profit.  The senior management likes to come up with programming for locations without asking for input from the populations that location serves and then places the responsibility for success on that locations clinical manager.  Meanwhile they will balk at implementing programming to facilitate treatment fidelity for existing clients.  This organization exists only to make long term patients, not to provide true therapy and healing.  Previous reviews stating that senior management is open and approachable is a lie and anyone who works there will say the same if given the opportunity to speak privately.  The CEO has a very fragile ego and will verbally berate anyone who \u201cquestions\u201d him.  The unit expectations for clinical therapists are currently at 30 per week, and you can definitely anticipate that increasing.  The Union is an absolute joke that does not represent the interest of the union members, rather they negotiate in favor of the company.  When the government was offering business loans and grants to assist businesses due to the coronavirus lockdown, Harbor fired a bunch of staff so they could qualify for the grant instead of the loan, further showing that the company cares more about money than the people that work for them and the clients they serve.  And last, the CEO made $430K in the last reported financials, and all this while he has been at the helm of running up budget deficits due to poor leadership choices, such as trying to expand services to Cincinnati and Florida.
