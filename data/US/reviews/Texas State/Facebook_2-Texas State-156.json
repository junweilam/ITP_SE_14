But inner circle who she hand selected (and those reporting to them) equally to blame.\r\nOver years in her quest to reach R1 status, president and other leaders undervalued Staff, especially when bringing $$$ to support service, faculty and students that didn\u2019t fit the mold/add to the R1 numbers.\r\n\r\nThe university that used to be so focused on student learning learning is long gone.\r\n\r\nMaybe the next president will make it better someday, but doubt it will be immediate.\r\n\r\nThis review written several years after I left but I still collaborate with colleagues, faculty and students in the department and center, and am involved with the university in various ways.
