I also had the opportunity to teach two larger (c. 30 students) lecture type classes. The Graduate School also offers a Teaching Certificate, which requires you to take classes that are actually practical - teaching observation, portfolio and website development, etc. The stipend is generous given the relatively cheap living conditions in the area - you can have a normal life and an apartment of your own, or quite luxurious accommodations if you share.

Departments also have individual power over some of the graduation requirements, which may not be written down or set out explicitly and half the time the profs have no clue either. Also, certain Graduate School policies - such as on sexual assault and harassment - are a mess, it's not clear what the process is at graduate level. The Grad Student Govt is now working on this. Summary: there usually is a process, but the School is not very good about its communication, which means that if you're not careful, you might end up fire-fighting various issues later in your grad career.

While you can still buy into the health insurance plan, you have to pay the FULL premium out of your grant, and thus you are paying taxes on that full amount.

Individual experiences will vary widely by lab and department, but overall Duke is an excellent place to get your foot in the door in world-class research.  Getting into research here is an excellent opportunity for recent college graduates looking for experience before graduate school or medical school, to build experience for industry research positions, and, if you find your niche and are comfortable where you are, Duke could be a great place to spend an entire career.\r\n\r\nThe biggest pro for me is the immersion in world class research.  You will get to work with some of the brightest and thoughtful people you will ever meet in your career.  The medical school and research campus is massive and it is amazing the sheer amount and quality of research that goes on here.  Access to conferences and other events will give you invaluable knowledge and experience in your field.  If you can get a job here straight from your undergraduate, grab it with both hands, as it is an excellent career first stop for any scientist.\r\n\r\nThe typical progression for those with a BS is to start at Research Tech II, which pays a competitive entry-level hourly wage.  With a masters, or after two years at the tech level, you are eligible for the salaried Lab Research Analyst I position, which brings a few perks, which I will mention below.  The hours are flexible and you get two weeks vacation to start (3 once salary), plus 12 holidays (5 floating), and sick leave.  The health insurance options are good, but you have to use Duke doctors if you want one of the cheaper options.  Hourly positions are under a pension plan paid by Duke, but once salary, Duke contributes at least 9% to your 403b automatically.  Other great benefits include tuition reimbursement for your children (Duke will pay a certain percentage each year for your child's college tuition (Duke or not) above a certain amount), among others you can check out at hr.duke.edu.\r\n\r\nIf you get into a growing/well-funded institute or lab and perform well you can jump job levels quickly, which is really the only way to make more money as raises were 2% each year I didn't receive a promotion.  The structure is set up so that one can jump up a few positions quickly but after ~7-10 years/3 level increases (to Lab Research Analyst, Senior) there's really only one more step up, so long term growth stagnates. \r\n\r\nAs with any major university, the perks of being associated are innumerable: farmer's market, gyms, intramurals, employee appreciation football game, museum discounts, access to all that the university has to offer.  You are definitely at the cultural heart of the city.\r\n\r\nJob security is also a plus, as even if funding runs out in your lab, Duke will find a place for you elsewhere.  People have worked here for 40+ years, having to jump labs and departments along the way.  Additionally, Duke seems open to people changing career paths and moving from lab positions into, for example, clinical or administrative positions within the organization.  They definitely seem to want to keep good people and try to do what it will take to keep them.", "cons": "The only two major cons that I can list from my whole experience, and my reasons for leaving, were pay and room for growth.  As an academic institute, the salaries are not comparable to industry money.  While not meager by any stretch, one does begin to feel the pinch of paltry 2% yearly raises with a growing family.  Glassdoor is an excellent reference to get an idea of what to expect, but as I said, promotions are the only way to get ahead financially.  While the entry-level pay is comparable to what you might get from industry, the salary growth with experience is much more modest than what one could expect with a company.\r\n\r\nThe other major con is room for growth, at least for my ambitions.  As a non-PhD scientist you are always going to be a tier below anyone with a PhD/MD, so upper level positions will be hard to come by.  Additionally, those non-PhD/MDs in management positions tend to stay there so there are very few opportunities to get to the top.  Switching to a non-laboratory role within Duke is an option, but was not appealing to me.  Basically, one hits their pay-band ceiling at around 5-10 years, with maybe one more jump before retirement.\r\n\r\nMinor cons include parking (free=nonexistent)  either pay $80 per month to park in a deck (good luck finding one without a waitlist) or pay less to park and ride the bus.  Or bike if you can.  Also, as with most college campuses in urban environments, you wouldn\u2019t want to be out alone after hours.  However, Durham gets a bad rap and around the main campus is not as bad as some might let on."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great University", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Durham, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Extremely stimulating place to be.

Because the organization is so vast, there is little practical emphasis on culture/values in the aggregate, as you would see in the private sector. The result in my experience was a poorly managed, very isolating and unproductive environment run by toxic leaders. They have already spent a significant percentage of allotted time & money for their grant-funded project, and have not produced any research at all. I could not wait to get out of there, but it was clearly not Duke's fault. Some professors/researchers just are terrible managers who should NOT be supervising others, and are not at all incentivized to improve in that area.\r\n\r\nWhile my brain recognizes that this extremely negative microcosm was not representative of Duke as a whole, I do think it says something about the structure/norms of academia. That was enough to give me pause about pursuing an academic career. I left to work at a startup, which has the exact opposite approach. My ratings below are STRICTLY about the center at which I worked; I have no doubt that others have had stellar experiences in other areas of the university. \r\n\r\nIf they are concerned, I would advise future applicants to ask questions about culture and leadership to see how thoughtful their hiring managers are about those topics. Do not assume that the university name guarantees intellectual rigor, honesty, or even competence.

We were expected to come up with unique and fun activities with little to no direction or supplies. If we needed supplies, we were usually on a strict budget which I can understand until you remember how extremely expensive this program is and how the kids deserve to have more opportunities for evening activities. The Mental Health Counslelor at our program was never available and when she did speak to students, it was unprofessional and accusatory (as many students told me). Overall the mentality from the upper level staff treated the students like they were suspicious of them or like they were being punished when in reality as a residential staff member it is our job to create a FUN and safe experience outside of class for them. I was also expected to take my 13 thirteen year olds on an off campus activity to somewhere fun and was expected to pay out of pocket for myself wherever they wanted to go. One session they wanted to go to the movies so I had to pay for my own movie ticket. We were told since we led the discussion with our students on where to go then we had to be responsible for paying for ourselves. (the tipsters paid for themselves too).\r\n\r\nLastly, I had to call the Duke TIP employment line with a question about how I was to receive my W2 since I had moved. I was immediately berated and yelled at for no good reason. I was shocked. I am always nice and polite on the phone and I have never, ever been treated that way. The woman on the phone called me entitled and spoiled for simply asking how I was going to get my W2.
