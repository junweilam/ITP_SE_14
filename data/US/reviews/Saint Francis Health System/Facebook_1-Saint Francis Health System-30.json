You can\u2019t refill your water bottle without a form. This place is so paper heavy, the only reason to actually have a computer is to answer your emails (they have ancient versions of Microsoft office too). \r\n\r\n Directors and below have to clock in and out because \u201cthey found a director taking advantage of being salaried.\u201d Rather than fixing that issue directly with that individual, they made a blanketed change for everyone. I wonder if anyone ever thought about evaluating performance outside of the hours you work, let alone putting more than 5 minutes into someone\u2019s annual evaluation? Of course, they don\u2019t pay you overtime but you have to work 42.5 hours per week. Directors also have to wear the full suit and tie - talk about dated culture! If you don\u2019t wear a tie, you\u2019re tracked down and asked to put one on. \r\n\r\nThere is zero focus on the culture let alone asking anyone how they are doing /liking their job at any given time. No opinions are ever asked and if they were, they wouldn\u2019t matter. Leadership makes decisions in a vacuum behind closed doors without anyone\u2019s input and that\u2019s just the way it is. Deal with it. \r\n\r\nLeadership doesn\u2019t play by the same rules as others have to. They park where they want (in delivery only or patient parking). Sometimes they choose not to wear a tie or jacket (but we have to), and of course they\u2019re leaving at 3:00 on Fridays while us peons sit there twiddling our thumbs until 4:30 rolls around. \r\n\r\nEveryone has so much stock in this new CEO but the culture is so deeply engrained in the people that work here that it\u2019ll likely take a decade to change anything.\r\n\r\nThey\u2019ll hang their hat in their great benefits but what they won\u2019t tell you in the interview is you\u2019ll have to wait at least a year (sometimes 18 months) for the retirement match to kick in and to be fully vested you\u2019ll have to sit in this hell for 6 years! \r\n\r\nI say again, this is the absolute worst culture I\u2019ve ever encountered."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Certified Surgical Technologist in Tulsa, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "State of the art facility", "cons": "Staff shortage, low pay, no clinical ladder"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good co-workers, yearly bonuses, Low pay, heavy/unsafe staffing assignments.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Respiratory Therapist in Tulsa, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great coworkers, yearly bonuses, variety of patient population you will see and learn a lot.

And Bedside shift reports are done on paper for each room to be discussed at the end of each shift and filled out with each new patient... I had no clue where to find the information required for this damn paper. Finally, a nurse explained where to find certain information on a patient and helped me fill out this thing, while my training tech was off having coffee with a pastor visiting the floor...or was it her favorite patients room she was hiding in for over an hour despite several calls for help and 30 minutes later showing up to help me with a patient after having to figure it out myself to find out the \"important\" conversation about India. Definitly more important than my patients health. End of shift or bedside reports are a hit and miss.. Either the tech coming off their shift actually cared about their patient and job or doesn't.. Either they actually know what's going on or don't and really dont care too. Some will go room to room while other could care less. Every patient is a problem to them unless drugged up and knocked out or asleep on their own will. Lack of hygiene care is something I've witnessed as well along with not placing call light or phone within reach..  I had to physically crawl under and behind a bed to untangle the call button and phone from the bed itself and unwrap it from the beds wheels. My patient wasn't even aware he had a phone and had been wondering how to ask for help... Did I mention he was completely restricted to bed rest ONLY which was not on our precious reports in fact it was completely inaccurate nor easily found in chart and lead to my patient falling and it fell to my shoulders and complete lack of knowledge."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "IS Department is a Great Organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Senior Programmer Analyst in Tulsa, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very flexible.
