It went downhill fast over the years and now that we were bought out by HCA, things are worse than I ever imagined.  HCA is a for-profit company and they very much act like it.  Nurses who had worked previously for them warned the rest of us. \r\n They have no problem lying to your face.  They told us there wouldn't be any serious changes immediately but as soon as they officially took over, they changed everything for the worse.  They said no one would lose their job and now every week, they're announcing that more jobs are being eliminated.  Patient care is suffering. There are more falls, more extubations, more pressure sores, etc and they could not care.  They don't listen to us when we speak up, they just brush us off.  So many experienced nurses have left and more are leaving all the time. Floors are now mostly stafffed with new grads and travelers (btw, they own the travel company).  They're sending HR around now to find out how to get nurses to stay. There is a reason they're offering such a large sign on bonus and higher pay.  They now realize you can't run a hospital without experienced staff.  Work here at your own risk.

They treat patients like customers in a drive through where quality is sacrificed for quick service. The nurses on my unit were constantly overworked and when we would ask for help from managers, team leaders etc, we were ignored. Several staff that I worked with had to write complaints to HR in order to ensure that staff was able to even get lunch breaks on a 12 hour shift. Upper management will lie to your face about what is acceptable staffing/patient ratios in order to force nurses to take more patients than they can safely care for. This hospital uses a very high percentage of traveling nurses because they can't keep full time staff nurses around longer than a year. They constantly bring up the fact that \"patient satisfaction scores\" are low but never actually listen to the staff when they ask for adequate nurse/tech staffing to be able to provide good patient care. One of the main reasons that I left this hospital is because I would not ever want to be a patient here and employees are forced to use Mission facilities with the insurance plan. I have worked for several other hospitals and I have never felt this way about any other facility. I have the utmost confidence in the doctors and nurses that I worked side by side with on a daily basis. However, when staff is spread too thin, and nurse to patient ratios are at unsafe levels, even the best healthcare team can fail and bad things can (and will) happen. I think it's just a matter of time before the current clueless management drives this place into the ground. However, since they are basically the ONLY choice in this area, they will continue to get business.
