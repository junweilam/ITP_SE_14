You are normally hired based on your passion and energy to perform your job rather than your experience in development work. You will often be under qualified for your position. \r\n\r\nIf you are not management/leadership, you as a staff member are disposable. Management strategically cycle staff in and out with 1 to 2 year contracts, to keep pay and benefits low, which indirectly sacrifices knowledge and experience continuity. There are no careers in GB unless you are management, which is riddled with nepotism and double standards. \r\n\r\nBe very weary of what management \"sells\" to you, as it is a very different outside of their office in the USA. Management fell into their roles early on and there is a prevalent \"founders syndrome\" culture.

They bog down staff with work and big ideas which are solely focused on improving the \"volunteer experience\".\r\n\r\nManagement have very little idea of what the major challenges are in our communities and rarely stay in country long enough to find out. Staff quickly realize how difficult and slow development work is and the investment needed to make incremental change.  Unfortunately, management have not gained that perspective, so staff initiatives are often marginalized or discredited. Whenever a decision needs to be made between investing into volunteers or our ultimate beneficiaries (rural communities), GB will always choose the volunteers. \r\n\r\nRelationships with communities only contain hints of community empowerment or engagement. Communities are often only participants to whatever staff tell them. The same statement is applicable towards volunteers, contrary to GB's statement of being a volunteer led organization. \r\n\r\nOften staff leave with a disillusioned and frustrated view of GB.

Employees are trusted to know what needs to get done and to keep themselves accountable for accomplishing their goals. As a horizontal org, many decisions are made across employees of the organization, and not by middle management, which creates a profound feeling of responsibility on the part of each individual employee. Especially for individuals early in their careers, this provides a unique opportunity for leadership which can be hard to find at such an early stage. For self-starters, it provides an optimal environment to run with their ideas, and to really make the most out of the experience/allow for entrepreneurialism to thrive. \r\n\r\n<Transparency>\r\nOrg decisions are collaborative, and made known throughout the entire org. Employees affected by certain decisions, are all bought into the decision process. Democracy plays a huge role in the organization, and there is a feeling of everyone\u2019s opinion matters. GB does a really awesome job in comparison to other nonprofits in the international development space of measuring impact, and communicating to employees/stakeholders.\r\n\r\n<Location>\r\nGB offers many opportunities to work/live in a different country, whether \u201cin the field\u201d or in the office, which is an incredible experience for those interested in immersing themselves in new cultures, while being paid to do so. There are few organizations that offer this type of flexibility and option fully managed by them to work in a different country. They do a wonderful job organizing all logistics of working/living internationally.\r\n\r\n<Career Advancement>\r\nDue to many of the positions granting the entrepreneurial freedom to employees, there is a lot of support for employees to pursue professional development and passion projects within their role. This in combination with a common nonprofit factor of understaffing, means that employees are given a lot of responsibilities, and opportunity to work on many different projects, and gain tons of diverse practical experience. With GB experiences under their belt, employees find a lot of doors opening that would not have previously been opened. This is especially true for employees getting started in their career. This is true of both internal career advancement within the org, and opportunities externally (where GB has a fantastic reputation with other organizations in this space and elsewhere).\r\n\r\n<GB Family>\r\nThis has been said in previous comments, but it cannot be stressed enough. When looking for a job opportunity, the people you work with are of utmost importance. GB employees are an incredibly diverse group of some of the most passionate, and well-rounded individuals I have ever come into contact with. Especially for recent college grads, it is a fun way to transition out of college and into the \u201creal world\u201d because, as a young organization, you are surrounded by people very close to your own age. Even when employees move on to other organizations or career opportunities, they stay involved with GB because of the bond to the community, and the passion for the mission/positive impact being created. It is very inspiring and exciting to be a part of.", "cons": "<Burnout>\r\nBecause employees are working for GB for the mission of the organization, after hours work is common. This can undermine the work/life balance that is important to prevent burnout. Additionally, with the empowerment management style can also come ambiguity, which can be hard to navigate for younger employees starting their career, and who perhaps may require a bit more guidance. These two factors in combination with many of the positions only being on a contract basis have contributed to a good amount of burnout and turnover; however, this is something that has been recognized by the organization, and that they are addressing to improve.\r\n\r\n<Financial>\r\nLike many nonprofit positions, much of the organization is driven by unpaid volunteers.
