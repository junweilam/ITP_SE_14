Very effective organization at influencing the development, passage, and implementation of policy and legislation. Really like the partner/coalition model - strength in numbers and diversity helps with effectiveness. \r\n\r\nReasonable pay for most staff and good benefits for an NGO of its size. A flexible work schedule and ample vacation time plus opportunities to get paid to recreate in the outdoors while doing ones job! Smart and dedicated staff for the most part and good collegial environment.", "cons": "Often times the organization is spread thin with too many priorities and not enough capacity to adequately address all of them. \r\n\r\nWhile the partner model is great, it can sometimes be challenging to mange the breadth of organizations, personalities and political leanings of different organizations involved and it takes a lot of staff time to do so. \r\n\r\nTraining opportunities for individual growth is seriously lacking for most staff. Those supervising other staff could use supervisory and leadership training - some seemingly have never supervised before nor have been trained to do so effectively. \r\n\r\nRegarding growth of staff within the organization, there are zero to very limited opportunities to move up in the organizational chart - i.e., no clear career path opportunities, some of which is indeed driven by the size of the organization and it's focused mission."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "There Is Little to No Diversity Here", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay and benefits are decent, but the working environment isn\u2019t worth it.", "cons": "Looking for a workplace that resembles our uniqueness as a country?
