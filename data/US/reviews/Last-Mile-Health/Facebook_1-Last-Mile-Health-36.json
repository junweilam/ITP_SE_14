Senior leadership and management care about staff, and leaders across the organization bring strong technical expertise. I myself am a manager with a clinical degree, a degree in public health and over 15 years of health system strengthening experience in Africa. Many of my colleagues have credentials that are similar or greater. It is my opinion that LMH has earned a deserved reputation as an employer of choice, particularly for African health professionals. The pace of work is demanding but one never feels they are in the work alone and the fact remains that we are working on demanding challenges. I have valued the effort the organization has made over the past year to direct more ownership and vision-setting to country-specific leadership. This has been a change, though one that more INGOs should adopt and embrace. Lastly, the term authenticity gap used within LMH is not a catch phrase intended to mislead. Instead it has been my experience that it is part of an organizational commitment and practice to always reflect on short falls with a learning mind, committing and then recommitting to improving and to communicating successes and challenges. I have actually only ever seen LMH downplay contributions to meaningful efforts, wanting to instead give credit to others and typically reporting attribution quite conservatively.", "cons": "Coordination across global and country teams can be time consuming and meeting heavy, with complications compounded when working across time zones and low-connectivity settings.
