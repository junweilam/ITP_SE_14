Small school. Nice staff. Great director. Great length off for holidays such as Christmas.", "cons": "No fridge to keep your lunch. Raises are hard to come by so try to start with a higher salary. They do not come yearly or quarterly as expected. Due to regulations, no commission or bonuses are given. Not really a set, good training program for new staff.
