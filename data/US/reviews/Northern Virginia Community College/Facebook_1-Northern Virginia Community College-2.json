Campus Administration is afraid of these individuals and do not support employees who have been victims to their temper tantrums. SWAM rules the place but food vendors are always bad and poorly priced. Many Brault admins do not have adequate experience or backgrounds for what they oversee/do. School's tag line should be, \"we hope you like filling out forms.\" There's no place to have legitimate communication. The president has \"office hours\" but not all submitted questions are seen let alone answered. You can enter with one job but can eventually do the job of an entire department. Extremely poor money management. For reference the school once \"misplaced\" 11million $ and pays for a lot of \"enrichment\" for its upper admin. Not much opportunity to move up unless you are related to someone, are part of the boys club, or kiss up to the right individuals. DEI office is a joke.
