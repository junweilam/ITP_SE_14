The culture is local and which unit you end up working for will have a big impact on your overall job satisfaction. As a state employee, your salary and holidays are largely defined by the state legislature, and Texas is not a state friendly to the civil servant.

The first few years I worked at UT were fine; however, after my unit got a new director (in 2018) everything went downhill extremely fast (I worked in GIAC - the Graduate and International Admissions Center). Within months, it became the most toxic and miserable place I'd ever worked. There was a clear pattern of nepotism and favoritism, employees were blatantly discriminated against and bullied (by the director!!), along with being shut out or retaliated against (again, by the director). It was toxic, unprofessional, and frankly embarrassing to work there. People started to very wisely jump ship almost immediately, and that meant piling on extra work to those who still worked there, while delaying hiring replacements for YEARS. I tried to stick it out purely for my coworkers, but eventually found a better job at UT, and only wish I'd done it sooner. You learn pretty quickly that competence only gets you more and more work, but without any comparative raise in title or pay. And UT's HR -- like HR at any other company -- exists only to protect the company, not the employees. If you find yourself in a similarly bad situation, the best bet is just to quit and find a job elsewhere on campus. I would avoid working at GIAC like the plague, but other departments have the potential to be pretty good."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "State Benefits Rock", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Fellow in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits package is pretty great, even if you leave before 5 years of service.", "cons": "Obviously it is located in Texas\u2026"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "good work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Server in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "workload is managable and offers foods for free", "cons": "job gets boring easily and students you work with changes frequently"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Average Pay Great Benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager, Senior Administrative Assistant in Bergneustadt", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits as it is \"government\" benefits.
