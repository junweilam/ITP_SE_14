The pay is very low relative to comparable positions, and while UT tries to add other benefits, they aren't that competitive to make up for the salary, especially with rising inflation, cost of living in Austin, and the cost of insurance. There also aren't really any advancement strategies for entry or mid-level positions. Bureaucracy, state legislation, and budget constraints (real or constructed) result in no pay raises and little to no professional development. The International Office is in better shape than most other academic departments on campus, though, since it can utilize fees from programming. Leadership tends to get mired in the mindset that there are too many battles to fight, and improving salaries for staff is too hard a battle to fight with the university. The result is burn-out among staff and a revolving door, especially among entry-level staff. There seems to be relatively little strategic planning. It tries to justify what it does based on data, instead of planning what it should do based on data. When I applied, I made it clear that I was interested in growing with the organization and asked about prospects for advancement, and was mislead to think it was a possibility to advance. Later I discovered that in order to advance to a mid-management position, I needed to have had supervised full-level staff in my previous work experience. This essentially creates a barrier for any entry-level staff to grow, and means that they have to go somewhere else. The office loses their expertise and knowledge, and create perpetual problems with team workload and continually needing to train new staff. HR practices assume that previous experience in terms of years yields better candidates. It's like this in most places I have seen across higher education, but a better system of applying and interviewing that addresses fit and incorporates areas the candidate can grow and contribute."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Working for UT-Austin was overall a fun and worthwhile experience, though a little daunting and emotionally draining.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Dec 2013", "job_title": "Graduate Teaching Assistant in Austin, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working as a TA provides a healthy tuition rebate and in state tuition if you work 20 hours or more.", "cons": "Working as a TA, you are often on call running odd errands and fulfilling strange requests at a moments notice.
