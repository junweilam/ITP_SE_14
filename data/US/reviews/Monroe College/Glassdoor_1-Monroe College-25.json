In their eyes these annual meetings they have where higher ups come to basically speak to staff and tell them what needs to be promoted, is their idea of \"training\". You either learn the admissions counselor role on your own as you go, or from experienced staff, or you don't point blank. \r\n\r\nThey make you work a late night and alternate Saturdays which they NEVER tell you about when you interview with them. \r\n\r\nSeveral times management, including higher ups, have said several inappropriate and racist comments towards minority staff and basically brushed it off as no big deal since in their eyes you are beneath them and they are doing you a favor by employing you so either stay shut or leave.  Which sadly many people who are left working there have either been there for over 10-20yrs and are stuck or they have a family and they can't afford to not be working. Sad but true. \r\n\r\nWork life balance sucks and they could careless. As long as you slave for them they are ok. Management actually calls people who take a sick day and badgers them asking why they are not at work even though they are entitled to five sick days and are not required to supply a doctors note if  they are sick...ILLEGAL!! \r\n\r\nThey love to rub in your face how \"Everyone likes to get paid so we need to enroll more students\". If that doesn't make you feel pressure or like your job is on the line I don't know what does.\r\n\r\nStaff is iffy. Some work very hard and some do bare minimum while others are just purely lazy and seem to get away with it, even promoted which is a joke. Depending on who you mix well with you will either be ok or you will have it rough. Meaning people who work here are very sneaky and can't be trusted. They smile in your face but talk about you behind your back or even worse go to management and create lies which then jeopardizes your job. Lots of favoritism here, so much it's sickening."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Bronx, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I had a great experience as a student and now as an employee.
