Since this town is so small management has hired family members, people they go to church with, ect., with no skills for the job they are supposed to be doing and the managers cover for them.

I know this sounds petty but I am telling you will have a knife in your back each and every day.  \r\nThe pay is terrible!  They will start you out between 8.00 and 14.00 dollars and your only increase will be 2%. That increase has been in place for years as they cry about how poor the company is while the executive level has very high salaries. They talk constantly about how we all need to tighten our belts and be thankful we have a job while they live in luxury.
