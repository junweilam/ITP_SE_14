This can be very emotionally difficult for some people. However, in my opinion the most difficult part of working here is the drama from other coworkers. It is a VERY unprofessional environment, and everybody has something to say about someone. If you're full time, there's always mandatory overtime. If you work full time weekends, you work 7a to 11p Saturday and Sunday and then you're REQUIRED to work 11p to 8a on a weekday to make up for the 9 hours you didn't work over the weekend(You aren't paid for an hour's worth of lunch). On top of that, the benefits are horrible and not really worth paying into, there are no raises, and the pay is very meager. The supervisors only make a dollar more an hour than the techs. The entire place is funded mostly by the state, so it has very tight purse strings. You can tell that by walking on the unit...the whole place is very drab, and is reminiscent of a prison. The paint is peeling, the plumbing system is ancient and always floods, the floor constantly looks like it needs to be mopped, the meals that clients get are at best the size of a snack, the group leaders require NO formal training or experience to lead groups and oftentimes know very little about actual mental health.....and the list goes on."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Could be such a great program...", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 May 2016", "job_title": " in Levallois-Perret", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoy the clients, PTO time earned is a plus", "cons": "Lack of mutual respect among staff, the manager will walk right by you and not acknowledge you, I don't think gathering the clients in a room and call it group time to put a movie in or turn on the TV is therapeutic .
