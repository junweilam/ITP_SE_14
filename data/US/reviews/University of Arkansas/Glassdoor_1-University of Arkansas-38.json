I know they had just transitioned into a new system, and a couple of HR reps for my school were very polite and helpful. However, when I called the general HR offices, the response was along the lines of \"We do not know. We are just now learning the system.\" I kept receiving emails and requests for paperwork and documentation which I had already sent, per their request, the week before the semester began. And the issues continued from there for quite a while. It took more than a month to receive my first paycheck, which was supposed to have been released within the first week or so of classes beginning. The issues have since resolved, and I appreciate the help I received, but this never should have been a problem. On top of this, there is an $1,800 cap per semester for TAs that are paid $12 an hour. I work in an advanced course, in one of the most rigorous programs in the university, and I easily work more than my allowed 10-13 hours. I am not paid for the additional hours I work though, due to the pay cap. I enjoying working with the two instructor's which have led the courses I TA for, but the compensation does not meet the value of the work. Minimum wage also increased in 2021, but the hourly rate for TAs did not. I wish the university as a whole would recognize the importance of TAs and their work, while compensating them a little better."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Senior Accountant in Poteau, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loved working on campus there", "cons": "None that I can think of"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good for students", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fayetteville, AR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They work with your schedule", "cons": "The pay could be higher"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Student", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fayetteville, AR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Dickson street is a fun environment", "cons": "Professor are typically sub par"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Work environment and parking", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 May 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Fellow in Fayetteville, AR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can access most of the research equipment easily. \nMost of the time, it has collaborative and friendly environment.", "cons": "Some professors do not fit their role and make collaboration very difficult.\nParking on campus is very problematic.

The pay is what you expect from a public institution so if you're fine with that then you'll enjoy it here. Fayetteville is well below the national average for cost of living and is a very safe town with a lot to do. Full-time employees receive a 90% tuition break which allows you to go to school for virtually nothing. You are even allowed to take up to three hours of classes during the day and not required to make that time up. The retirement and health benefits are spectacular here. In my department I can say without a doubt that people are treated with respect which I couldn't say about Brown.

Promotions can literally take a year, unless you are able to be moved to a title that has nothing to do with your job description (and even so, the salary is super low). Working overtime meant nothing because my department didn't pay overtime. Instead, any overtime hours were added to my leave time, which I never had time to take advantage of. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying every department is the same, but low staff salary (especially if you are a non-classified employee, are ridiculously low.  If you're really ready to open your eyes, you should find out how much your supervisors are making (or how much your super hardworking co-workers AREN'T making) by taking advantage of the state salary database. Literally just look  up your state's public college and university salaries and be prepared to cry when you find out you make less than 10% of your supervisors salary. Really. \r\n\r\n- Overworked\r\n- Very underpaid \r\n- No time to take advantage of vacation benefits\r\n- Upper management keeps rolling out changes without warning the staff, which creates learning curves in the middle of super busy seasons\r\n- Getting promoted is an infuriatingly slow process; especially since wages are already very low\r\n- Yearly \"bonus\" is a joke\r\n- Yes, you get 90% off tuition, but you can only take a couple of classes a term (if your supervisor approves the time off). \r\n- Your job title doesn't mean anything. An \"administrative assistant\" in one department can work 60 hrs a week and barely keep up with the workload and someone with the same title in another department can have a very positive, low-stress experience.
