It's very rare that I have an interaction with a student or their equally entitled parent which doesn't revolve around the student getting their way, no matter what policies and procedures are already in place. \r\n- There is a very severe financial crisis that is being pitifully downplayed. Enrollment is down, retention is down, budgets are being cut very often. I would not recommend beginning a career here unless you would like to be out of a job in a few years when the doors close.\r\n\r\nIt's very upsetting that many of my colleagues have fallen for the \"family-feel\" mentality that McKendree wants their employees to adopt.
