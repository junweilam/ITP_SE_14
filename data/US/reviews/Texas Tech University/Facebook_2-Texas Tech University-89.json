I've lived in Texas my whole life (but have travelled extensively), and not only is \"southern hospitality\" a real thing, but both Lubbock and Texas Tech University specifically embody that ideal.  The people are helpful, kind, and fun. \r\n\r\nThe campus is gorgeous.  New buildings are being built around the clock.  I went to undergrad and law school at TTU, and there has not been a day in those nearly ten years that something new hasn't been in the process of being built.  \r\n\r\nLots of opportunity for advancement. \r\n\r\nReally collaborative work environment.\r\n\r\nLubbock is a great town.", "cons": "Lubbock is great, don't get me wrong, but I'm not above sharing it's weaker points.\r\n\r\nIt truly is in the middle of nowhere.  The city itself is actually quite nice, but outside of the city there's literally nothing but farmland. Nothing ... but farmland.  That said, the city of Lubbock is quite large, and offers a variety of restaurants and venues.  Live music is available, but is not a \"huge\" part of the culture.  Traffic is virtually non-existent.  Crime and cost of living are low.  And Texas Tech Football is a pretty big deal.  \r\n\r\nAs far as working for the University, there's really nothing negative to say about it.  There are, of course, some politics involved, particularly in the higher executive ranks.  But by and large, this place is full of people who genuinely care for the university, love what they do, and are willing to help a total stranger."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "was a good job while you went to school", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Front Desk Attendant in Lubbock, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "had flexible hours when you had classes", "cons": "not very good pay but we'll do when you are in school"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good and bad", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Fellow in Lubbock, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good salary, good health care and good retirement benefits", "cons": "toxic work environment and no professional development opportunity"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Student Employee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Residential Tutor in Lubbock, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work for students", "cons": "None.

HUGE PLUS); short shifts; free residence hall parking access for student assistants that live off campus (great if you're looking to score some parking for on-campus events/commuting to school/and if you want to be really sneaky, you could do laundry at the residence hall you work at for free, but I don't personally condone doing that); great alternative if you don't want to become a resident advisor/didn't get the RA position; you basically get paid to sit on your caboose 80% of the time and get $7.25/hr for it; you can EAT on the job!!! (a huge plus for me, because my stomach is the size of an elephant); part-time position; move in to campus early, so you can get comfortable and get first pick of your side/room before your roommie(s) arrive; if you work in the dorm you live in, you virtually have 24/7 access to your lock-out key and access card so you will have no marks or penalties on your lock-out card for the entire year; you would have to suck majorly or get into some serious trouble to get a bad evaluation at the end of every semester, so you basically always get a good evaluation; you can easily work this job and still rock your extracurriculars (I am in the band and go to rehearsal every day, I have a 3 hour evening rehearsal once a week, and I go to home/away games and I have had no problems getting anyone to cover/trade shifts); you don't really need to go through your supervisor first to trade/cover shifts with other assistants, just don't go over 19 hours a week; very easy to train and understand office procedures; you don't have to deal directly with the residents if they have roommate conflicts/serious issues (you just call an RA to deal anything like that); it's easy to talk to your supervisor if you have any issues with your schedule/etc; don't waste money printing your assignments at the library when you can just do it on the job; direct deposit pay; it's possible to fit in a workout video on youtube or blogilates or something in the early morning when the office is a standstill; work study available; no tax deductions from your paycheck; you can leave to go to the restroom for like 5 mins and there's freedom to move around the office if you want to so you're not completely sedentary", "cons": "It's a 24/7 position, meaning there's one person in the office at any given time to deal with students that have locked themselves out of their room/emergencies/etc, so that also means everyone gets at least two \"crap\" shifts throughout the week (i.e. shifts that run through the weekend and asinine early shifts, like from 9pm-12am, 12am-3am, and so on), so you have to carefully schedule these shifts around your classes; you have to deal with a bit of freshman sass and drama (but that's typical of any people-oriented service); there is a student housing staff banquet at the end of every year, but all the CAs must go, so they look to the SAs to cover all of their shifts and I covered so many shifts that weekend and that was probably the most boring weekend ever in the office for me (but major green was acquired!); you NEED to learn how to speak up if a 3am-6am won't work for you on a particular day, especially if you have a bunch of hard classes later on in the day because soon enough exams will come and you know you will be sleep deprived for it if you're working a late shift and you will be stuck with that shift because NO ONE will want to take it  for you and you just have to realistically look at your schedule and think, \"hmmm, will this work/school schedule make me want to pull my hair out???\" (and DON'T feel bad if a shift isn't working for you because after all everyone else is thinking about themselves and the staff will have no problem taking advantage of your eagerness to take an early shift. putting your academics first is KEY); if you're not a night owl, don't take this job and just go for hospitality services; you move in to campus earlier than everyone else for scheduling and training so you're lonely for a few days; checking people in and out at the dorms at the beginning and end of each school year is fast-paced and a wee bit stressful, but basically the RAs deal with all that; you can't leave until the next person comes in for their shift and if they're late you have to stay and it might affect your schedule; it also sucks having a shift from 6-9am because when the hall secretary who is supposed to work after you calls in sick at the very last minute you have to figure out who is going to fill that position and most of the staff are going to class around that time, so that can be pretty inconvenient especially if you need to go to class after work, too; you usually get paid on a monday or a tuesday, so no pay day just before the weekend begins; you don't work more than 19 hours on this job, so don't expect a lot of dough to cover all of your expenses; don't even think about sleeping on the job because on-call hall coordinators wander in and out of the residence hall during the late hours and they need you to be alert so they can sign a check-in sheet (sometimes they will even want to have long conversations with you especially when you're sleep deprived); in my experience, my supervisor was very passive-aggressive and was very disorganized but this doesn't affect you as much as it affects the RAs; sometimes the environment can be negative when the RAs are venting and stressing out, but most RAs have the resilience to turn themselves around and come up with a solution to a problem; you have to come in 10 mins early to do the money count when you clock in and again before you clock out, so if you don't know how to count money you're screwed; you don't always have quiet time to yourself to do homework since RAs and other staff come in and out of the office as needed (some even chill out at the hall secretary's desk to watch netflix with other RAs and basically interrupt your intended study time). \r\n\r\nThis is all I can think about, but I would definitely recommend this job if you don't mind the little quirks and are looking for flexibility."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great people, not so great work in the Student Union Building", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Operations Crew in Lubbock, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My co-workers were, without a doubt, some of the most fun people I've had the pleasure of working with. Despite our manual-labor oriented tasks working with the Operations Crew, we always made working pretty enjoyable, and when we weren't working, we were usually hanging out watching movies and generally just chilling down in our little cave in the basement. It was a very relaxed, college-oriented atmosphere, and if you can hang with the Crew's level of banter, you'll have no problem fitting in and making friends. \r\n\r\nOur superiors were also great to work for.

In addition, we performed general maintenance tasks such as changing light bulbs and batteries, and occasionally painting. Put simply, the tasks themselves were simple, repetitive, and to some degree, thankless, since many in the building barely even acknowledge our existence, and a reasonable pain tolerance is a must due to the number of times you'll probably drop a chair on your foot when you start out. \r\n\r\nI left the position, mostly because I graduated, but also during a time of change. The Operations Crew as it currently sits is being broken up into Maintenance and Setups, the first of which is a small group devoted to small repairs, the other of which is larger and devoted to only setting up rooms. This will likely change the entire formula of the job I held fairly significantly, so my review here may not be entirely accurate compared to the current situation. However, both bosses over each group are good to work for, so I believe that, while possibly more formalized, the position will still be one worth looking at. \r\n\r\nFinally, the pay starts (for my position) at minimum wage, with a .25 cent raise every year you work there, meaning that if you work that position for the full four years of college you're looking at a whopping one dollar more per hour than when you started, which, considering the amount of work we do doesn't seem entirely fair, especially with the knowledge that the position *used* to pay $10 an hour.
