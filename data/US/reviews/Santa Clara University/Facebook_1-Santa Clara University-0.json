For example, adjunct faculty in the law school are excluded from faculty meetings and from department meetings; they must learn about curricular changes, even those that effect the classes they are assigned to teach, third hand. This not only leads to isolation, but prevents the productive exchange of ideas and the comradery one might expect in a less stratified law school.\n\nThis stratification also shows itself in resource distribution \u2013 if an adjunct needs to have an unanticipated and confidential conversation with a student, he or she must hope to find a quiet corner. Adjuncts don\u2019t get assigned office space of any kind.\n\nIn addition to these systemic exclusions, the disdain with which \u201clesser\u201d faculty are sometimes treated can be frustrating and soul destroying. An email from an adjunct to a tenured member of the law faculty will, in my experience, be ignored. If it includes a question, it may be forwarded, without comment, to a different department in the law school. Perhaps most unfortunate from the point of view of student success, ideas from adjuncts may be ignored, even when the adjunct has considerable expertise in the subject area. For example, despite the recent, steady declines in bar passage rates at Santa Clara Law, the office tasked with bar preparation at Santa Clara Law advised me to take my extensive experience with bar tutoring to a law school that needed it \u2013 and even attached a list of California law schools.\n\nAfter years of effort, adjuncts across Santa Clara University were able to unionize, despite fierce opposition from university elites. One comment from a tenured member of the faculty inadvertently pinpointed the fundamental problem the organizers sought to address. As preface to his lengthy remarks, this professor remarked that adjunct unionization efforts did not affect him since he was tenured.\n\nIt was a remarkable \u201clet them eat cake\u201d moment at an institution that prides itself on the pursuit of social justice."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Marketing in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Santa Clara has many amazing people who are smart and committed.

The experience gained through calling is very valuable, and the call center itself is a great team environment. For sure the most engaging on campus job. The call center also pays commission on donations, so there is monetary incentive to perform well. Despite the best efforts of the upper management, the students, supervisors, and director make the call center an enjoyable, lively, and social experience, encouraging a team mindset between employees, and incorporating fun games into the job.", "cons": "There is a lack of general transparency between the upper management and the callers. Everyone that we directly interface with is awesome, but management above the director of the call center is not very in-touch with the callers. I have been written up for unclear and unfair reasons, and had no option to dispute the write up, even though I tried. I know that I am not the only one who has dealt with this. The general feeling is that \"the people upstairs\" are kind of scary, and want to kill the fun and social part of the job. Between this and the sometimes random punitive action, the position of student caller feels awfully expendable, which is not very motivating or conducive to productivity. It seems like instead of changing the way things work at the call center to incorporate employee feedback, the university would rather hire a slew of new people to replace the ones who raise objections. That may contribute to the crazy high turnover rate. Generally, the big bosses in the fundraising department do not seem very interested in improving the call center. Things are very set in their ways, including unchanging scripts, and redundant, tedious training sessions.
