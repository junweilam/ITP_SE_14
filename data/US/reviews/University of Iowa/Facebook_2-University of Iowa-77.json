Promotions do not happen here. - The majority of staff are over 45 years old. If you're young, expect to be in a very small minority and thus, not taken as seriously as older employees. - A lot of work seems to be generated for the sake of it. People at the UI are rewarded for looking busy by contributing work that has very little value - Iowa is now controlled by a far-right, anti-education conservative legislature. Do not expect raises or budgets, and I would go so far as to say everyone should always be worried about the next budget from the Board of Regents and how it will be interpreted by the shot-callers at the university."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Bakery", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Head Baker and Manager in Iowa City, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "benefits, Roth IRA, decent base salary, very anti discrimination", "cons": "long hours with little support or organization"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Supportive Student Work Environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Front Desk Administrator in Iowa City, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Build schedule around classes, casual and friendly working environment, supportive management, develop meaningful working relationships with English professors and graduate students", "cons": "There really were no cons.
