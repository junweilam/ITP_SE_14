The patient safety assistants do not get paid good for the work they do. You are mostly sitting with a patient your whole shift and caring for them. There are a lot of mental health patients you sit with and no training on active listening, motivational interviewing, trauma informed care and mental health first aid. If you speak up to the manager she will shut you down and be dismissive. The manager is always busy and rude to those that don't agree with her and aren't a yes man or woman. If you want to advance in your career the only route seems to be a Certified nursing assistant or registered nurse, which I am not interested in either. The house supervisor acts more like your manager then your supervisor does. The union dues are too expensive. You are going to get burnt out easily if you don't have a good support system and don't take care of yourself."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Friendly Staff, Troubled Management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Coos Bay, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The community at the hospital and within the town itself is very nice.
