And pretend like everything is okay? And that you're not understaffed, it's just that you're just a useless piece of human trash that can't do the job of 8 people apparently? The CEO of this hospital is abusively rude and will completely ignore you even if you're standing in an elevator with her and saying hello. That's a huge red flag, and really all that needs to be said about the culture - YOU WILL BE IGNORED HERE, READ IT LOUD AND CLEAR. Enjoy the gaslighting, I hope it doesn't burn the building down. I have no respect for the leadership at this place. As others have said - RUN far far away. There are other jobs, there are places that will invest in you and value you.

However, now that they got their fill of labor, they pulled the ol' switch-a-roo. Under the new cash balance plan, Sutter Health is no longer competitive with companies that offer 3.5% or better 401k matches.\n\nThere is a lot more details to it, but basically, younger to mid-career employees got screwed hard and Sarah Krevens, along with other long tenured folks, resigned with golden parachute retirement packages they called voluntary employee separation packages (VESP). Except they only made sense for Sarah's demographic. Everyone else: too bad, so sad.\n\nAs a matter of policy and hiring practices, Sutter does not promote from within. All openings are open to the public and you will have to compete with folks who already poses the skills and experience listed in the job description, while you can only offer examples of work you've done in your existing job underqualified job, and maybe a certificate or degree vouching for your ability to learn, but without experience, too bad, so sad, they pick the ready-to-go applicant.

I went from being the \"golden child\" of my site supervisor to getting written up for things that I didn't do. I even had evidence to prove it, but they wouldn't even look at it.  To make a long story short, Sutter was hiring an outside private practice physician to come on their team. Part of his agreement to come on board meant that the site supervisors had to find positions for all his staff because he didn't want to leave them with out a job. They had me train his receptionist, and then they made up something to fire me, and gave her my job. (I was notified that this was happening to me by another employee who was in the click that apparently knew I was getting fired before they actually did.) This was very unprofessional and shady on their part to gossip about employees like that. I also witnessed a nurse who worked in our department for many years and for Sutter for 27 years get fired because she was at a too high level of pay for their liking. They don't care about their employees, we are only numbers and dollar signs to the upper management.  When I spoke to Human Resources to ask for help in this matter, they told me that they couldn't help because of the budget cuts they would be with out a job too.  All in all if you are in the \"click\" as mentioned above, you would get promoted to supervisor with no high school diploma, or get promoted when you don't show up for work half of the days of the week. (I have seen it all!)  As far as going to school to get advanced degrees, Sutter states that they will support that and even help pay for your classes, but if they won't let you leave 30 minutes early to get to a class, one time a week, how can you go? The bottom line was that they would't let me leave early because I was the only reliable employee they had in that office.

Over all Sutter is a great company to work for but not at the Dale road clinic."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "It doesn't get any better!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Sourcing Recruiter in Roseville, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I could go on and on about how great Sutter Health is as an employer, but I will boil it down to a few highlights from my personal experience.  I originally worked for Sutter as a contractor in 2014 and was hired Full-Time within 6 months. I quickly worked my way up to joining the Talent Acquisition team (my goal) and had great success! Things came up during that time of my life where I needed to move to a work-from-home position and an external opportunity presented itself. I sadly had to leave Sutter Health for 3 years, but as soon as a remote position opened up, I was contacted to interview for the role. \n\nAfter a couple rounds of interviews for a couple positions, I was hired to return to the team I SO greatly missed! I learned a lot working for another organization and gained great experience, but literally nothing compares to the mission, values and culture Sutter Health encompasses. It was VERY easy to find my \"why\" working for Sutter Health versus the other company. My team is passionate about Recruiting and strives to deliver the best service to candidates and hiring managers. The environment is incredibly collaborative and encouraging of career development (I'm proof of that). Strong work performance and results yield trust and career growth opportunities--it's recognized by management across the board.  With that said, the potential to grow into other positions whether it's a lateral move or being promoted is endless. Want to work for a different affiliate in a new city?  We have options and I love that.  \n\nI love working for a Shared Services model, we are a leader in the healthcare industry! In this model, I get to have my hands in systemwide changes, recruiting, and get to strategize with leaders and key players in all specialties. More importantly, the work I do impacts Sutter Health at the business and culture level. I love recruiting people into the organization for all types of roles, I look for passionate, hard-working people that want to choose Sutter Health as their employer and give back to the communities we live in. Being part of a not-for-profit company breeds a culture of service and depth.\n\nAgain, I can't say enough positive things about Sutter, I would highly recommend applying and joining this awesome company!", "cons": "Every company has its cons, the grass is never greener on the other side (I would know)--it's all perspective. One of the downsides about working for a newly transitioned Shared Services organization is there is a lot of clean-up, streamlining, communication, and training that needs to take place in order to have it function very well.  People who don't work well in an environment that has many changes won't thrive. You need to be agile and up for the challenge knowing it's for a greater purpose and outcome. \n\nThere are still employees resisting the Shared Services model, even after all these years, and that causes obstacles. However, there are great leaders in place making an impact and helping the shift the mindset!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent job with great pay", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jun 2016", "job_title": "RN Case Manager in Sacramento, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Per diem employees get a 25% differential in pay in exchange for no benefits, but can still use the 403B retirement fund.

Many employees, including the ones with fmla/ada needs, fear taking action for mistreatment because of the retaliation, being pushed out, and threatened. \n\nThey ask for ideas on how to improve processes & other things but either ignore your ideas or steal them & behave as though you have not contributed anything.\n\nIf you don't participate in giving your whole life story, or participate in every single activity (dressing up, games; even if you participate in the ones you do like) you get accused of not being a team player or a part of the \"work family\" & your annual review/raise suffers for it.\n\nUnrealistic expectations and metrics. Even the best employees such as myself and others could not meet some, and when you bring it to their attention they scoff at you, brush it off, reprimand you or try to, take no accountability or suggestions.  You go from being the top employee to the one they push out. \nHigh turn over rate in operations and support. On my team alone in support, 4 of us have quit within the same year, 2 within a few months apart, 2 within the same week; & these positions formerly had a low turn over rate. \n\nThey tell you your job role & how to do it, but when you do it the way they said to, you're still wrong. A lot of contradictions, double standards, hypocrisy, and no self-accountability especially in management and upper management. \n\nThere is a protocol to follow when something is needed, and instead of following it- people wait last minute and demand they get what they need. They will wait the hour before It is needed to ask for something that takes hours, or even days to complete because they procrastinate. When you don't jump when they ask, because it is impossible and or because they didn't follow protocol when others did, they blame you and try to throw you under the bus instead of owning up to their mistake. \n\nI have a huge stack of evidence that I had to submit to the department of labor.
