The big bosses in administration (I won't name anyone) are very cheap. The facility is constantly understaffed which causes the employees to overextend themselves to keep the facility running smoothly.

The charting system is archaic which causes things to get overlooked or missed because they don't want to invest in updating anything. They hardly promote employees and there are little to no incentives. Staff morale is very low and it is clear that the CEO only cares about money and not the well-being of patients or staff. There have even been times where extremely aggressive or inappropriate patients have been accepted while staff was ill equipped only so that beds could be filled. Even when all the beds are full, patients have been put in dayrooms to sleep for the night. \r\n\r\nAll of this really takes a toll on the already stressed employees."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "For the most part Patients run the place", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Mental Health Technician in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lunch available at cafeteria, experience, friendly coworkers", "cons": "Patients can be aggressive or destroy property regularly with little to no consequence"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "MHT", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Feb 2021", "job_title": "MHT in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "never boring, co-workers, seeing the treatment work", "cons": "little to no management backup"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "High turnover rate", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Mental Health Technician in Las Vegas, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good to gain experience as a mental health technician.
