If you're working at a company that provides an adequate living salary, there's really no need to have a fundraiser for their living expenses. \r\n\r\nMost people made it work by being married or by receiving financial support from parents. From tenured professors to lowly GTAs, everyone made abysmal salaries, even though most employees work really long hours, are always connected to email, etc. \r\n\r\nAgain, as with most universities, managers are not empowered to provide salary increases at all, so really our direct managers are not at fault-- they're getting paid poorly, too. But really, the \"no power to change anything\" culture reads somewhat as an excuse, and everyone needs to accept that it's up to them to change working conditions."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Manhattan, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work environment is like a big family.", "cons": "I don\u2019t have any cons."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "yes", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Manhattan, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "yes there are lots of them", "cons": "no there are not many cons"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Go cats", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "9 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful place and beautiful people", "cons": "Not much to explore around"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent Education", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Interior Architect and Designer in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The education curriculum is comprehensive and engaging, and has taught me more about Interior Architecture than I ever dreamed of.", "cons": "The coursework can be a little overwhelming at times"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great work place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Agronomist in Manhattan, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Accommodating of schedule and excellent co workers.", "cons": "Part time work, with university"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "very good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Teaching Assistant in Manhattan, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice people, nice work.
