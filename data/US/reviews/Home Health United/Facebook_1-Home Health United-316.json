They expect you to work more and harder for less with no regard for you to have work/life balance. Sr. management's mission statement is actually \"no money, no mission\".

As another reviewer of this site states, management will write positive reviews with 5 stars to up their star rating and/or ask staff members to do the same. They do not have morals or values Look at the review titled \"Reimbursement Cuts from the Feds Create Challenges\". Are we to believe the pros is management and the cons are staff? No staff member would ever state to get rid of all staff. It is pretty apparent they wrote this since they are getting so many negative reviews. I am currently looking for another job, and cannot wait for the day to give them my notice, though they don't even deserve a notice to be given. I dread getting up every day and going to that place.
