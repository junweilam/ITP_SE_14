Now, visitor gets a \"chance\" to give BMC money in recognition of our good work. \r\n\r\nAlthough BMC actually own its own very profitable insurance company, all co-pays have skyrocketed and premiums continue to rise. No matter how much money they make, it's never enough. We know when we get the letter that opens, \"We value your commitment...\" it's time to get ready for yet more sacrifice.\r\n\r\nBecause ti is run like a business, although it is non-profit, it persists in micromanaging how nurses work. Nursing, is, in inherently unpredictable. Treating it as assembly line work results in fragmented and short staffing and unsafe patient scenarios. This has become the norm at BMC.\r\n\r\nWe lost the ability to park on campus and must now bus in from a distant lot. We must now show up 15 early(on out time)  as we often must wait until the bus is full before it departs. We are not compensated for this time. At shift's end, it is common, once again,  to have to wait for the bus to arrive.  \r\n\r\nRecently, any work over 12 hours is straight time unless it happens to exceed 40-hours.\r\nOne might think having to stay beyond 12 hours in order to complete the workload might constitute a dedication worthy of overtime. Not anymore.\r\n\r\nFinally, as  part-timer, my insurance premium is about 300% more than a full timer, same coverage, same policy. I asked the CEO to rationalize this gross disparity....to paraphrase, he told me others do it so we do it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good institution with potential for greatness.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Medical Secretary in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Full service organization can and does reach a large demographic area, providing much needed basic and specialty services.", "cons": "Hard to move up in the organization, resources including people are not used to their best potential - seems more hiring is done from outside the organization than movement from within, management out of touch with employees."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The Big Bad Wolf", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jun 2016", "job_title": "ACCESS SERVICES in Holyoke, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I honestly have nothing positive to say about this company.
