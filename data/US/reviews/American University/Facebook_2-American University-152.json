As the title suggests this job is what you make of it. If you want amazing benefits then AU offers it. Great healthcare, 2:1 matching on 401k retirement, they will completely pay for an undergraduate degree for you or direct family members and you pay only taxes on masters degrees. Overtime is pretty abundant. There are multiple training opportunities and the ability to propose your own trainings. Uniform is professional. Contrary to previous reviews you do get EVOC trained (emergency vehicle) to drive lights and sirens. This police department is very officer friendly and while working at an extremely liberal university, still has your back. The academy training is 12-13 weeks and has improved immensely from previous years. (Start running and doing pushups NOW if you\u2019re not already and you\u2019re applying) You are considered a university special police officer but this still a pretty professional department where you can do some great police work if you actually put in the effort. AU is a community that really welcomes a community policing model so if you\u2019re not interested in that, keep looking. There are opportunities for upward mobility or to get special assignments and duties such as Field training officer, background investigator, training instructor; but you have to request them and work for it (makes sense to me). For a police department this place has a great work life balance with a good amount of time off earned annually and actually available to use. Holiday pay is amazing!", "cons": "The pay is up to par with the rest of the universities in DC but should be higher. Starting pay without experience is $22.95/hour currently. Staffing is an issue currently but that seems to be with every police department right now. You do not carry a firearm so there is a safety concern with some situations.
