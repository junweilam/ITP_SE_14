Management often refutes that the residents do not see our stress, however,  they clearly do and they feel it. Since pay is 11.00$ an hour with a max cap at $13.50, employees will often call in. There is no reprimand for calling in, and therefore, the staff is mandated to stay an additional 8 hours (16 hour total) to work. The pay does not compete with any other retirement facility in Kent county. I have done private research through glass door, and indeed (really not that private) with the addition of a few other job sites and have noted that every single nursing facility starts at $13.50 and extends upwards for resident aides. I have noted various locations where weekend pay is 16$ an hour. What I find confusing is that residents pay 6,000$ and up, per month. I am very confused about where that money is going.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I was recently told by a residents family that their mother\u2019s rent went up because the staff was getting a pay increase to their wages as told by management. I contacted management and was told that we would not be receiving a raise. I am concerned that this industry is stealing money from affluent families for their own personal gain. \r\nAdditionally, CVGL does not adhere to hygiene codes and did not have a thorough drug distribution training. This claim is corroborated as resident aides were required to administer food and serve in the dining room after toileting and bathing residents. As a former aide, I constantly took care of urine soaked diapers, BM messes, treating wounds, utilizing needles, passing medications ect. Whilst I also practiced sanitization, that alone, was not a large enough preventive measure for my standards. \r\nIt was disgusting for the residents to know what I had been helping with before lunch, and for myself. I never felt comfortable toileting residents and then serving food right after. Despite aide and resident concerns voiced to management, aides were just released from dietary duty a year after I began working. So, as of now, aides have been out of the kitchen for 2 weeks. When it comes to laundry, don\u2019t assume your getting back clean clothes. While it might have been washed, the soap used as detergent is actually just green hand soap. The clothes never smell clean. This is especially worrisome for those who constantly soil their sheets/clothes.\r\n\r\nIn regards to passing medication for residents, while there was a training on how to handle drugs, many errors were made in the last year by aides. There needs to be a clear training on what each medication is, as many aides are unfamiliar with drug terminology. This alone, causes great distress to residents as when they ask what pills are what, many staff do not know. This is a direct reflection on management and the lack of training. Furthermore, there needs to be a closer supervision on narcotics as unfortunately these go missing often. \r\n\r\nI am concerned that management will continue taking advantage of families and staff. It is clear that many employees have recognized their worth and quit. While I cared for my former residents deeply, I could not continue to be treated and compensated so poorly. I loved each and every one of my residents like my own grandparent and felt very conflicted about leaving. I obviously am passionate about my residents or I wouldn\u2019t have taken the time to write this comprehensive review.\r\n\r\nMy objective in this note, is to encourage dialogue about the salary, and treatment of employees at Covenant. I encourage families to demand to know where their money is going and why turnover rates are so high for employees. Almost every corner of CVGL is mediocre at best, however, the staff are the individuals who have the power to make or break this experience with your loved one."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Compasionate", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Human Resources in Santa Barbara, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In today's market and work envoronment, it is rare to find an employer that treat you like a person.
