The overall body of students is a mixed bag of hardworking/intelligent to lazy/underprepared.  The campus feel is more on the commuter side, hurting the \"collegiate level\" feel and culture.  Many students lack any since of pride in the university, and this has only helped to create identity issues for Barry.  The pay is absolutely awful.  Many people, including myself were asked to take on the workload of two to three times the rate in which they are actually compensated, without any aknowledgement or recognition for the extra work they perform.  There is no relief in site, as the university is constantly cutting into department budgets, and with no raises in the near future, the overall morale of university employees will continue to go down.
