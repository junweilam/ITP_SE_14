It's outdated and unfriendly. I didn't meet anyone who liked it. In fact, everyone I talked to hated it. All HCA facilities are using some version of Meditech.\r\n\r\nVery difficult to work the med/surg floor, even for travel nurses with 25+ yrs experience. It's disorganized. Patient load is 6-7:1 on medical and higher on surgical floor. ED is said to be a nightmare also, though I don't know firsthand. Patient-centered care is not possible in med-surg.\r\n\r\nTravel RNs (who work all over the US) say that it's a \"legal nightmare\" (could lose license) and \"awful.\" High turnover of both RNs and management. (Lots of new interns being drawn in regularly, but most don't stay.) Travelers say they are never coming back!\r\n\r\nRN preceptors leave much to be desired, though they do try. They are extremely rushed, like everyone, and they have just a brief orientation on how to precept. They are not teachers by nature and can be very impatient and counterproductive at times. They only receive $1 per hour differential for precepting, and all of them are pressured to precept new interns. Travel RNs not allowed to precept, though they would probably be excellent in this. \r\n\r\nIf your Spanish is not fluent, you'll have a hard time. Some preceptors will be understanding, others might be scornful. Most people will try to help you, though. There are many Filipinos, and Spanish is not their native language; so if you're a minority, you're not alone, at least."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Cna", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Sept 2017", "job_title": "CNA in Brownsville, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "most of my co workers help each other and respect each other", "cons": "i work at the icu and i've had some issues but manager can't never help you she always tells you to find another place if don't like  ..
