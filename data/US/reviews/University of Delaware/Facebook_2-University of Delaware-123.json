Build valuable skills: This job can help you build important skills such as public speaking, communication, leadership, and project management. You would also gain knowledge about health topics that can be applied to your personal life and future career. Flexible schedule: Many peer health education programs offer flexible scheduling, allowing you to balance work with classes, other jobs, or extracurricular activities. Work with a supportive team: Peer health educators often work in a team of other students who share similar interests and goals. This can create a sense of community and support, as well as provide opportunities for networking and socializing. Gain valuable experience for future careers: This job can be a great way to gain experience that is relevant to many future careers in health, wellness, education, counseling, and more. It can also be a valuable addition to your resume and show potential employers that you are passionate about helping others. Overall, being a peer health educator can be a fulfilling and worthwhile job, with potential benefits for both personal and professional growth.", "cons": "While working as a peer health educator at UD can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, there are some potential cons to consider: Limited hours and pay: Peer health educators are often employed on a part-time basis, with limited hours and lower pay than some other jobs on campus. Emotional demands: Peer health educators may have to deal with emotionally challenging situations, such as supporting students dealing with mental health issues, sexual assault, or substance abuse. This can be difficult and stressful, especially for those who are new to the role. Training requirements: Peer health educators typically have to complete extensive training, which can be time-consuming and demanding. This can be a barrier for those who are not able to commit to the required training schedule. Limited career growth: While the experience gained as a peer health educator can be valuable, there may be limited career growth opportunities in this field. Working with diverse populations: Peer health educators may need to work with students from different backgrounds and with diverse needs, which can be challenging and require a high level of cultural competency. It's important to weigh these potential cons against the benefits of the job and your personal goals and priorities before deciding whether to pursue a position as a peer health educator at UD or elsewhere."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Vibrations lab", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Apr 2023", "job_title": "TEACHERS ASSISTANT in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not too many weekly hours and good professor", "cons": "Only offered in spring semester once a year"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Student", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Student Ambassador in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good team culture and environment", "cons": "No cons come to mind"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place to Be", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Fellow in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Medium sized community, lots of collaboration", "cons": "Not much space for anything, including offices"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place to Work For Delawarians", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Research Coordinator II in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-fantastic benefits -inclusive community -lots of communication -flexible schedules -free tuition", "cons": "-work life balance depends on department -pay for parking"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Positive Environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Student Associate in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "supportive collaborative professional development opportunities", "cons": "not much variation in work"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Okay if you just want a degree; run away if you want respect and fair pay.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Instructor in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunity for learning and growing as a graduate student.", "cons": "Terrible pay, no guaranteed summer money despite required summer work, and a top-down culture that infantilizes and belittles graduate workers."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good school", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "3 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good reputation, competitive in terms of research, good relationship with surrounding businesses (i.e. biotechs, pharma)", "cons": "low pay for grad students"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Newark, DE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can decide work hours around class schedule as long as meeting requirements", "cons": "a lot of work !
