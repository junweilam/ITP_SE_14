With each new campus, they aren't keeping up with staff and they aren't taking care of existing issues. The company that bought RVU is running it into the ground, trying to make it more like St. George University. They fired the last president and replaced him with someone far less passionate about education and caring of RVU's employees. The person in charge of many of the administrative departments is terrible but no one will do anything about her--despite the high turnover underneath her. They claim to care about things like integrity and diversity but it's just for show. And as someone mentioned before, retaliation and the HR Dept is a huge problem there."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor compensation, upper management out of touch", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Staff in Parker, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My core team was an incredible group of people: dedicated, productive, and amazing at their jobs.
