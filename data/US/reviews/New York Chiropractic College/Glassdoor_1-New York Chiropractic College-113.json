Very stick-to-the-status-quo type of management, and long-time employees dislike when new ideas come to the table to improve the college and experience for students. Enrollment is down, pay was cut because of COVID and while I was there, there was never a mention of pay going back to normal or even raises. No job opportunities for growth as administrative staff. The school's marketing hasn't gotten with the times and still preforms like its the 2000s, even with the new college name. Enrollment has been down overall so outlook is bleak without new, fresh, much needed improvements to draw in students and keep the ones that are there from hating the place so much. Instead of investing in worth-while initiatives (or even marketing efforts) to draw students in and actually improve the college, they fundraised money for a courtyard-style clock... and that says what it needs to about where this school's priorities are. Administration cares enough about the school to keep it funded and running, but not enough to improve it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "One of Best Colleges to Work for-- LITERALLY!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Nov 2012", "job_title": "Counselor in Seneca Falls, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "there's a reason why NYCC has been on the list for \"The Best Colleges to Work For\" for several years in a row!  \r\nAdministration is very supportive, Finger Lakes WINE COUNTRY!!!,dirt cheap low living costs, campus is large, facilities, great retirement benefits, great health benefits (free acupuncture & chiropractic care for you & your immediate family!)", "cons": "the DC clinic system needs to figure out ways for the student not to sit in the \"dungeon\" unproductively when they should be busting their behinds to get some clinic experience. \r\nSome of the AOM faculty need to be more professional in dealing with other people."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Associate Professor, Clinical Science in Seneca Falls, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have worked many different jobs in many different careers over the span of my working adult life.
