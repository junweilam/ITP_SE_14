We spend months talking and toiling about \u201cstrategy\u201d and making everything more complicated than it needs to be. The partners in the field are doing the tough work. We are investing the money. It should not be that complicated - but the Gates culture is hooked on complicated. \r\n\r\n-Second , lack of diversity and unconscious adherence to white supremacy culture where cutthroat behavior is normalized. Employees who are actually from the places we are supposed to be supporting are marginalized and/or pushed out. Grant dollars go to white-led, \u201celite\u201d institutions and there is little interest in changing this. It\u2019s actually quite shocking for a place that claims \u201cAll Lives Have Equal Value.\u201d \r\n\r\n-Third, the HR department is a disaster. HR gets a bad rap in most organizations and it\u2019s not always fair. However, at the Foundation it\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced. There are way too many of them (like 70 HR people).  The left has no idea what the right is doing, you ask a question and you get four different answers, and the turnover is ridiculous. Ive been a people leader for 4 years and had over a dozen HR people come and go. You can barely get a question about basic benefits answered. Don\u2019t get me started on the recruiting process and philosophy on pay equity. \r\n\r\n-Fourth, your team will go through change every 6 months so just expect it and plan for it. I understand  change is inevitable, but it\u2019s almost a disease at the foundation.

On the other hand, if you don't look like who they're comfortable with, best of luck.\n\nIf you're in public health this place actually pays an appropriate amount for your expertise.", "cons": "During my time I saw the foundation repeatedly state they cared about diversity, equity, and inclusion, and wanted to move us towards being a more diverse workplace, where all felt included and able to bring their best forward for the mission of the org. And yet, during my tenure I saw multiple women, half women of color, leave my division. Not truly out of choice, but because their management chains were atrocious. Retention is key to making any org a truly inclusive space but I'm quite convinced that several white people here see POC as interchangeable - all you need to do is hire the next POC when one leaves rather than fix the toxic system that views us as less capable and yet asks us for more work than our white colleagues.\n\nWhite men fail upwards here. WOC are pushed out. This needs to stop now and not in 2 or 3 or 5 years from now. But from everything I've seen the foundation's plans to address this, it means taking an incredibly slow pace on this to the detriment of those most discriminated against. \n\nEvery year our division saw new guidelines about what was required to go up for promotion - and yet none were actually applied equitably. It was disheartening to see that I met most of the requirements for a role twice more senior than what I had and to hear from multiple colleagues that they saw that in me as well, but to get the opposite message from my chain of management who were disengaged with my work. There's very little accountability here when you're discriminated against.\n\nMany people hired here are bright, smart individuals but know nothing about what they're hired to do. People hired to do public health research and yet have never done it before and are managed by other researchers with no prior experience in the field either. It's the (hopeful) blind leading the blind here and the people purportedly being served and supported by this research deserve better. But you won't get that when you have poor leadership with little relevant experience with the field (here I'm not referring to the CEO, but rather individuals lower than that). \n\nFinally, let me repeat: I was gaslit by several people in my division. Bringing it forward did nothing for me besides put a target on my back. White men have questioned my work when they have no expertise in it and they are taken seriously solely because of the seniority of their role but not their actual experience.

Kiss up and kick down.  You will survive well if you follow this simple principle.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I did a lot of work -- some of it meaningful, but i feel much of it was a lot of hot air pushed by people who wanted to make a mark for themselves in the two years they would be spending at the foundation.

If you complain or ask for guidance, you will be seen as a problem and there will be a 'performance' issue in your future. \r\n- There's a lot of 'good job!' to your face, and then finding out from your manager that there was a problem with your work.  Not that your manager can tell you exactly what that problem was or how to improve, just that your work is unsatisfactory and you need to do better.

It can be hard to find.  Upper management is dominated by whites, mostly by men. Some teams (including some that would surprise you) are almost completely white, with only the support staff being of color.  Hidden diversity can be even more difficult, although the home office is very accepting of GLTBQ.\r\n- Over-reliance on consultants, including those who are grossly overpaid.  They build knowledge and take it outside of the foundation, and are working for their own benefit, not for ours.

It is in some ways. Unfortunately, the more positive aspects of startup culture are not represented here. In a startup people tend to rally behind the mission and all pull together to accomplish goals. Success is interdependent at a startup. \r\n\r\nJust the opposite is true at the foundation. It's very much a zero-sum game and success is not conceived of as being mutual. Turf wars abound between teams and within teams; struggling for attention/blessing from the highest levels of foundation leadership, funding for their projects, team headcount, and media coverage. This creates a lot of enmity between people and teams, the greatest casualties are the great ideas that never come to fruition and missed opportunities. Being a team player is not on anyone's annual goals.\r\n\r\nThe organization is constantly reorganizing. This creates a lot of uncertainty for projects, issues and the people who work on them. Twelve to eighteen months between major reorganizations is about the norm, shorter for more minor reorgs. Leadership can't seem stick with one operating model long enough to thoroughly vet it before moving on to the next thing. \"Top tier\" management consulting companies have deeply embedded themselves at the foundation and attached themselves to influential leaders. These management consultants are very effective at triggering reorganizations which result in a big payday for them. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leadership:\r\n\r\nThe incentive is to \"manage up\" rather than manage across or down. Without a good boss/mentor/champion behind you, it's very difficult if not impossible to advance your career here. Very few people are lucky enough to find someone who wants to pull them up.\r\n\r\nThere is little to no emphasis on working together better. After an internal analysis revealed a level of dissatisfaction around the culture and how people worked together, a senior leader was asked what was being done to improve the situation. This leader indicated to the staff that those are not the metrics that leadership is focused on. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Work:\r\n\r\nThe public perception may be that the foundation is a fulfilling place to work because of all the good it does. The reality is quite different. The foundation is essentially a checkbook and as an everyday employee you are many layers away from the work being performed on the ground by sub-sub-sub-sub-contractors. Additionally, the foundation's grantees and vendors charge what is known as \"Gates rates\". Almost every request for funding or contract is significantly inflated. It's often disheartening to see so much of the budget be eaten up by inflated expenses.\r\n\r\nThe foundation tends to work with the same set of \"partners\" who have become entrenched interests at the foundation. There's very little appetite or ability to solicit fresh new ideas from hungry, smaller partners. In the case of these large entrenched, and often highly entitled, partners, the relationships have become dysfunctional - more about the money than the good work.\r\n\r\nStrategy refreshes for issues are frequent, intense and can take upwards of 5 months to complete. This prevents the real work from being done on the ground. Supporting these strategy refreshes is another huge stream of money for \"top tier\" management consulting firms working at the foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coworkers:\r\n\r\nCautionary tale: I got thrown under the bus on my third day of employment after being invited out for a \"welcome lunch\" by one of my peers. On the fourth day our group's Business Officer chewed me out because my lunch-mate from the previous day had reported me and intentionally misrepresented what I said. You never know who you can really trust.\r\n\r\nPeople from the northwest tend to be pretty frosty and passive aggressive, but the folks here take it to a whole new level. Feeling completely alone in a building of 800+ people was common.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the lower you are on the totem pole, the tougher it is. The lowest level employees, the Program Assistants and Program Coordinators have it the worst. The treatment they received from higher ups was often thoughtless as if they were lesser humans and sometimes bordered on abusive. Many people who are Senior Program Officers and above demand to be waited on hand and foot. Example: many of them don't know how or refuse to print their own documents. \r\n\r\nHR is completely ineffective. They will always take the side of the higher ranking employee. Staying out of the cross hairs of others is your best and probably only defense."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Complex organization with admirable mission, well-meaning employees, and significant cultural issues.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful co-workers.
