No one has there known office and intakes were done in the kitchen; more than once might I add despite us staying we don't have any rooms open to give the clients brave enough to seek services the respect they deserve.\r\n3-The offices are bad. Super small and they always overbook and don't know how to schedule.\r\n4-The reasons the CEO discharges clients are EVIL. A client gives them an attitude DISCHARGED. The client's kid is annoying? DISCHARGED? \r\n5-The lies the CEO told me while I was working there made me ill. My anxiety was through the roof and I went to ED once because of it.

Caseloads can reach up as high as 55 people to be seen in a 40 hour work week. The owner refers to herself as a CEO and is not present physically or emotionally enough to accept responsibility for her short comings. The benefits are mentioned but never formally offered, people have to chase and bother upper management to sign up for insurance and then many are fired before they can use it or continuously go without it for months without explanation. Many people have signed up for the 401k match and never received their match money. Many programs are offered that do not exist, clients appointments are canceled frequently or without notice.
