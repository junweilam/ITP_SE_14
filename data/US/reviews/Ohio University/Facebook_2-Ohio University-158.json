I am not sure if you can be employed by the main campus writing center post-remote, or if remote tutoring is still available at this time** Working as a writing tutor through OU was honestly a highlight of my college experience! I loved the stability of the work week-to-week, and the work environment was great (even due to the remote status of last semester). The remote aspect of this position also opened up this opportunity for me personally, since I attended a regional campus. You get paid for your assigned hours regardless if you actually work with a student during them, so sometimes you are basically paid for just being \"available\" during that time. I thoroughly enjoyed working with tutees from multiple majors on their papers, as this allowed me to learn about many different topics that I would not have been exposed to otherwise. Overall, I would highly recommend this job to any student who enjoys helping others with their writing - or who just want some extra funds to help them get through the semester!", "cons": "There honestly are not many cons about working as a writing tutor for OU, in my opinion. The work is pretty straight-forward, although you do not always know what stage of writing the tutee is at prior to the session. This is less of a fault of the university and more the tutee, since they have the option to describe what they are working on when they schedule the meeting (but often choose not to do so). Also, there isn't always work to be done, but you still have to be \"available\" during your hours if a tutee schedules a meeting last minute - which can be quite hectic. Again, this isn't truly a con because you get paid regardless of whether you complete sessions or not, but sometimes the uncertainty of whether you have to work with a tutee or not can be anxiety-inducing.
