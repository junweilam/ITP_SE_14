This benefit sets the hospital apart from other hospitals in the area. Another attractive feature of working at MHRI is the opportunity to meet many different medical interns and residents who take part in patient care, as the hospital is a teaching hospital of Brown University.", "cons": "MHRI's greatest flaws rest in management. Many of the department managers have been employed with the hospital for decades and were grandfathered into their positions. In some cases this means that college-educated employees are working for managers with little or no college education, who are making several times their salary. The lengthy tenures of management can also prevent opportunities for advancement among lower-ranking employees. As of the time I left MHRI, upper management also began reducing the hours of certain positions to make employees ineligible for the free health insurance or tuition reimbursement program.\r\n\r\nAside from the general managerial issues, the work experience at MHRI varies greatly from one department to the next. Some employees work in departments with high morale and job satisfaction, while others are downright miserable. It all depends on the leadership and management styles of the particular department managers. There are managers in certain departments who govern their employees through threats and fear, treating their workers as disposable labor. Unfortunately, these managers have been grandfathered into their positions, and will most likely remain with the hospital through retirement."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Overworked and Understaffed", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2011", "job_title": "Pharmacist in Pawtucket, RI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Food in the cafeteria is subsidized by the hospital.
