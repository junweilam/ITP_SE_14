Faculty salaries are quite low; people with doctorates are very regularly paid $45k or less a year, and yet they have the audacity to solicit faculty for donations to the university. The teaching load is also very high for the type of institution and the salary; non tenure-track faculty generally teach a 5-5 load, and tenure-track faculty teach a 4-4 load.

The pay is insulting (unless you are business or computer science or upper admin) and the weakest departments with the least talented faculty often get the highest salaries because they have the most trouble attracting good people). Administration does not see the connection between academic excellence and faculty excellence and student success. They let any student in that has a brain cell and then want you to focus on retention by providing better service to the students. The administration is hyper-focused on marginal changes in admission numbers, rather than looking at overall numbers. They fail to rally around the real strengths of the university and rather tout that they are 109th best in online programs.
