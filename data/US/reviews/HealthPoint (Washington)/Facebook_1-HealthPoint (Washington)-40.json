( however, can be different from clinic to clinic)\n\nI have seen so many coworkers tears at work. We are not children. You are not a principal. As a manager or supervisor, you don\u2019t call out employee from their position in front of patients or coworkers then point out at them. Everyone can see their face, tears and discouragement.

It requires far more than a few meetings and a day or so in a clinic. \r\n\r\nWhat makes several peoples lives\u2019 uncomfortable is that those who sit up in a VP or a \u201cChief\u201d level position have little to no care about our daily life in the clinic (or at least it feels this way) and they are making decisions left and right without consulting us or asking our thoughts. It seems the Admin leaders would rather lecture me and others about what\u2019s on their mind and what we should do, rather than ask us...what\u2019s working or how can we help. We need to be ask how can we help before being given more work... we simply cannot add more to our full plate!\r\n\r\nWhile Admin leaders talk a big game of inclusivity, transparency, and trust of people across HealthPoint ... I have yet to see any of these traits from the Executive Leadership Team, and very few of these traits are demonstrated at the VP or Director level.
