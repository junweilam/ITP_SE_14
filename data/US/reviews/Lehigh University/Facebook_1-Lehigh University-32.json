At different times during the span of only 1.5 years the same leadership for administration has been allowed to hire five full-time staff members from outside of the institution. Each time they have abused the policy to get rid of the person before hiring the next, creating a revolving door of unjustly dismissed personnel. To begin the cycle, COH leadership for administration hired two staff members, then six months later fired them both. A few months afterward, the same leadership for administration hired another person and fired them six months later. And in another few months, yet again, two more people were hired and fired six months later by the same leadership for administration. The COH leadership for administration has fired every person they have hired from outside of the institution while only justifying it by the probationary period. They are not required to provide a performance improvement plan and do not have to substantiate any of their blatant mischaracterizations of the employees' work. An institution with ideal oversight would wonder \"how can administration directors hire so many employees and then fire them in that period of time? They are the ones hiring them, so how can they misfire so many times?\" The obvious answer is leadership is the issue and not the hires. Yet, the institution through the highest of COH leadership and University HR have done nothing to stop this cycle. Each staff member hired and set up for failure has communicated to HR about the issues. And yet, the leadership for administration is allowed to relist for positions, only to hire someone to fire them in another six months. The leadership for administration takes people away from secure jobs for promise of an opportunity to build a new college, only to take away the livelihood that their families rely on. They've derailed and negatively impacted thriving careers by thoughtlessly putting gaps in resumes and causing them to have to defend themselves in future interview processes. The only staff member safe from the leadership for administration has been a person who has been referred to openly as a \"best friend outside of the university;\" someone who this leadership for administration has brought with them from department to department across the university. Only staff from inside the university are protected because the leadership for administration is unable to fire them without going through a true process for dismissal. For those who are hired from the outside, the leadership for administration never has any valid reasoning, and a true process would never result in the employee being let go. Instead, they rely on the probationary period to justify narcissisms and playing God with people's careers and lives. If you are looking at any open positions for staff in the Lehigh University College of Health, please, please run the other way. If not, you will almost certainly be forced to six months later.", "cons": "A perverse cycle of hiring and firing staff members from outside of the institution without cause.
