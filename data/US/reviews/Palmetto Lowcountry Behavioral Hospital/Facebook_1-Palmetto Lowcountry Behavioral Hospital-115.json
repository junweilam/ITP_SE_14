There is also little to no training on how to run daily group sessions with patients. These patients are people from terrible circumstances, who have PTSD, who are in need of the most acute care. And they are not receiving the help they need, not in the slightest.\n\nMost of the patients admitted here are involuntary. Unfortunately that leads to them being treated poorly because either way, they are viewed as an insurance check rather than a person in need of help. A dollar sign rather than a person. The goal is to get them in and out, and bill their insurance every time. Don\u2019t be fooled. \n\nThere are some great staff who truly want to help and do their best. But there are plenty others who are there for a paycheck and just to socialize/gossip with their coworkers. It\u2019s a toxic work environment. There is physical neglect going on here as well, especially on the older adult unit. \n\nI could say so much more. The system and this place is incredibly corrupt and should be shut down or rebuilt."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Listening to employee feedback and making improvements would make this hospital a much more enjoyable work place", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Oct 2012", "job_title": " in North Charleston, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There is a good sense of team with those who you work with regularly.
