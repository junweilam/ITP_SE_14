I was an older graduate student, having been full time employed for about 9 years prior in various environments before returning to school.\nAfter my first semester the entire full time staff of the department turned over. Some of those staff got out because they were better than Simmons could ever provide for them. But one staff member was a bully who harassed many, if not all, of the part time employees - who were all students. The interim director knew about it but didn't do anything. Because they knew they were quitting. Eventually that bully staff member harassed a part time employee so seriously that I think they were asked to leave before legal got involved.\nFollowing this entire staff turnover the department was incredibly short staffed with a new director taking over about a month prior to move in. This director is one of the most toxic people I have ever worked for and created an incredibly hostile work environment. It got to the point where the director literally stopped speaking to part time employees. Just walk right past us. The part time employees tried expressing their concerns to the director directly a couple times to just be completed gaslighted. At one point the director threw a piece of paper across a table at us. Then we brought our concerns to the VP of the university who told us that if we didn't want to work there to just quit. Keep in mind They said this to student employees. They said this after 20+ student employees all voiced the same concerns. I understand sticking up for the new person in the department but the music needed to be faced and instead students were told to get over themselves. \nThen the department became fully staffed in December. By June, every single December hire had quit. A whole new staff turnover.\nThis job negativity affected my opinion of the school as a whole institution. I would never ever recommend anyone work there and I've even recommended against attending there because of my experience there. The way I heard full time employees, who all had at least masters degrees in higher education, speak about students was appalling. And they would just laugh about it. It was awful. I stuck it out because I had no where else to live and still be able to attend classes. And that's a sentiment that many of the part time employees expressed - that they couldn't speak up, they had to deal with the abuse, otherwise they'd be homeless. What an awful situation to put students in."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Prepare to be overworked & underappreciated", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 May 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Professor, Teaching-Track in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Engaged students eager to learn.\r\nSupportive and interesting colleagues.\r\nGreat location.", "cons": "Poorly managed with too heavy administration\r\nHigh service load\r\nLow pay\r\nDemoralized faculty & staff"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It's fun", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Designer in Cincinnati, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to start a career", "cons": "Nobody liked me very much"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Don't work at Simmons, not worth the stress and burnout.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful, dedicated, hardworking people and coworkers and colleagues for the most part.

First off, they will interview you and make it seem like the place is really high class and make you feel like your applying to a very serious job..WRONG. No matter what position the technology department hires you for from your set of skills, they wont tell you that you will be required to do EVERY job which includes, phones, tech support, event support, printer support, classroom support and so on regardless if you have experience in doing it or not. If you have a question on how to do things they will most likely refer you to \"techknow\" which is their data base for how to's and changes to procedures which is rarely updated and is full of out of date processes or they will just throw you into the fire and basically make you figure it out. I was hired as an events person and learned harshly that events was not all I would do. The job is extremely thankless and they will work you like a slave! The other faculty and staff are terribly fussy, short tempered, pampered, and expect the world from you at the drop of a dime and feel entitled to whatever they want. The scheduling is horrible and you basically have to fight for hours that are all set up in 2,3, and 4 hour increments and what ever is left over gets randomly thrown into your work schedule. They will also schedule you on certain days regardless of your availability and if your time is limited or you work other jobs, be prepared to work 1 to two days a week there. There is next to no communication from full time employees (management) to the part timers and if something goes wrong, they all point fingers instead of solving the problem. They have secret employee reviews and I'm not joking, they have meetings and some of them are to review the employees BUT, they don't give YOU the employee any of that feed back. They also don't give raises so whatever rate you're hired with you're stuck with that. There is virtually no room for advancement unless someone dies or leaves because they too tire of the B/s. Unless you're a starving college kid, a co-op, or being hired for full time, there is no reason to work at Simmons Technology as a Part Time employee.
