So if the raise didn't bring someone up to 85% of the Prior Year's midrange, only then was that person's salary increased. So those positions missed out on their raises that year. There have been multiple years since when no raises were given while other colleges' staff Were given raises, so SSC lags even farther behind.\n\nIn addition, staffing levels are very low in many areas- specifically Advising and Counseling, and Financial Aid. Some professional staff regularly easily work 50-60 hours/week with no additional compensation or even appreciation which was most recently evident when some of those same staff, with excellent annual evaluations, had their contracts not renewed - simply for verbalizing the truth when asked why issues happen - due to upper administration not giving the proper support to the areas that need it.
