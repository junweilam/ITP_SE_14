They care about their patients, and as both a former patient and employee, it was amazing to see that the service they delivered far exceeded my expectations. I will also note that, despite the lack of pay increases and the fact that advancement is based solely on how many years you've worked for the company (which is nearly identical to archaic union-type rules; however, all Banner employees are non-unionized), \"base\" or introductory bay is quite fair, and in the nursing world, is probably above market pay compared to other cities.", "cons": "The primary con is that that there's a complete disconnect between the hospitals and corporate management. For the most part, I mean that new corporate policies and rules are put in place by desk-dwellers at the corporate office (occasionally in conduction with the handful of higher level, \"desk only\" administrator-types at the hospitals). The policies or rules are almost universally designed to save money, and almost universally have a negative effect on employees (example: change from performance-based pay raises and bonuses, to a policy of no raises, or a maximum raise of 1% for the top person in each department). While base pay is pretty good, such practices certainly lower overall morale. It's a double-edged sword, though. The nurses and staff dealing every day with patients may be aggravated by such changes, but they still treat patients in exactly the same way. I'm not saying that they shouldn't, but the company acts as if it knows very well that the high moral fiber and ethics or the medical staff will not change, even if the company slowly takes away fringe benefits (lowering vacation days or PTO calculations), eliminates pay raises, and at times, disempowers employees from bringing forth ideas for real change and improvements. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the only way to increase your pay or get a promotion is to work for the company for a long time. They virtually instill this into the minds of each new hire, and you'll find many employees with \"certificates\" on their walls, stating that they have worked for the company for 5, or 10, or 15, or 20 years. This is highly reminiscent of unions and almost militaristic. The major downfall to this is that when a higher position opens up, the individual who applies and has the most \"time in\" with the company, is the person who gets the job. This can result in bizarre scenarios where a mid-manager in an area such as food management is promoted to a corporate desk job managing payroll or IT (without the person having any education or experience in that area)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible HR policies, dieing network and loosing talent", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are some good people that work in the departments and benefits are about average.", "cons": "work-life balance is terrible, work on average 50 hours a week on a relatively low salary for the type of job / work I do due to bad HR policies that don't allow pay increase. 4 yr college degree plus additional certifications...

The vast majority of the people I work with are intrinsically motivated to provide the best care for their patients as is possible. We have some really stellar departments that employ people who really care about what they're doing and also have the professional skills to support it. At least on my unit, the nursing staff is world class. Most of us will bend over backwards to satisfy our patients' needs, and it is an honor for us to do so. For many of us, healthcare is about more than just treating a patient, it's about understanding and engaging with the individuals we are privileged to meet. Our work culture is one of high expectations, and we are always willing to support each other to do whatever it takes to create the best outcomes for our patients. I am honored to be a part of this team.", "cons": "Banner may call themselves a non-profit operation, but do not be deceived. Sometimes the only thing it seems like this company cares about is how to make a profit. Since Banner bought out this hospital that was once directly connected to the University of Arizona, I have experienced some unfortunate changes that have greatly affected my ability to provide the highest quality care to my patients. The first thing to go was a 1:9 maximum tech to patient ratio. When the University was in charge, most of the time I had no more than 7 or 8 patients. I am someone who recognizes that the role of PCTs and nurses is about more than just gathering information and implementing a plan. It's also about being there emotionally for people who are going through a difficult time. In order to provide the best care, one needs to learn to understand the patient on a personal level in order to tailor one's approach to the patients needs. Banner upped our patient ratio to 1:12 immediately. More work expected, less time to attend to each patient, and no increase in pay to compensate. Furthermore, this company can't seem to hire and retain staff at an acceptable level. More people have left my unit since Banner has taken over than have joined it. As a result, we are understaffed nearly every day and night. Often times, we can't even provide enough sitters for patients who represent a danger to themselves. Charge nurses are not only taking on the responsibility of running the unit, but are also given up to five patients in addition. The wonderful men and women I work with have nevertheless managed to provide excellent patient care. But it's burning all of us out. Employees who used to have an especially optimistic demeanor have quickly become tired and jaded, and it's so sad for me to see. Personally, I'm getting burned out at far too young an age. When something comes between me and providing my patients with what they need, it makes me so angry, especially when it comes to something preventable, like appropriately staffing the facility. Lower level management is doing the best they can to support their staff, but it's plain to see that they too are being stretched beyond their limits. Make no mistake about it, Banner is about one thing: making money. Which, by the way, is in my interest too. Unfortunately the low pay I receive is hardly comparable to the work I put into it. (In fact, Banner recently realized they were paying their staff far lower than the national average and, in an attempt to correct it, decided to give us all a basically negligible raise (yay! 50 cents more per hour.))"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Lots of freedom, not a lot of opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Sun City, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management does not micromanage, flexible on schedules, benefits are decent compared to other places I have worked, most staff is very personable", "cons": "As a float your efforts will not be recognized by the ones who matter, and there's not a lot of support or opportunities when it comes to additional training"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Watch your back", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Medical Assistant/PTR in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Schedule, PTO and sick time, healthcare access", "cons": "Constant tattle telling on each other, Providers complain about patients alot and why they are there, its well known that you cant trust your coworkers which leads to a hostile work environment, nobody talks to each other.

The current trend coming down from management is that of customer service and satisfaction. But the philosophy from management has been to devalue its employees and the work that they do. Senior management\\Leadership does not have the background in the customer service industry to balance employee appreciation and customer satisfaction. I have read most of the reviews listed on this website and for the most part, they are fairly accurate in all their assessments. In my opinion, one of the biggest indications is the quantity of job openings still available for registered nurses at a time when the economy is bad and jobs are at a premium. In my department, we are experiencing a fair amount of employee turnover. It would appear that, whatever money they are saving by eliminating all the employee benefits and perks that originally made banner a good place to work, they are reinvesting that money into training new employees. They haven't got it in employee retention, especially in the customer service environment, has a significant impact on the level of patient care and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAn example of management's poor leadership is as follows. In the same week that nursing was told about the reduction in benefits, overtime and 2% annual pay raises, there was an article in the local paper about the opening of Banners new $90 million Cancer Center opening in Chandler. even with a minimal amount of critical thinking, one can deduce that banner had the capability of Not cutting employee benefits, that they were using the economy as a ploy to further their own gains and expand the Banner Empire at the costs of its current workforce. There is definitely a trend that is being handed down from executive management that includes manipulation of its workforce and a total disregard for the employees that are directly responsible for our clients and for customer satisfaction. But the executive management is not likely to be replaced until the time that investors in those individuals with secondary interests in Banner Health begin to see a decline in revenue.\r\n\r\nI work in multiple departments and the one factor consistent is that there is no loyalty to banner from its employees. If senior management were to open their eyes and actually get in touch with the employee, perhaps they would understand and begin to make a change. I just do not think this will occur in the near future."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Hypocritical, dysfunctional system that MUST receive closer scrutiny than what it has received!!!!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Physician", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.

Within weeks of buying off Casa Grande, Banner's siren call lures the Board of Regents to allow to take over the University of Arizona Health network, promising over $500 million in capital improvements, $20 million per annum in research, and other treats, while dumping its failed NextGen EHR - how is this fiscally possible when it concurrently is building scores of new community health clinics? \r\n6. The sincerity to be interested in academic medicine is questionable- While its doctors lament the paucity of time and state of academic teaching of future doctors in its flagship hospital in Phoenix,  it is some how \"ready\"to take over an academic health network , citing synergies that will benefit the merger?  This is merely a calculated  act to \"enhance its branding\" while forcing its doctors to forgo its mission to teach and focus on income generation by overworking its hospitalists and over-consulting its specialists, to generate more revenue. \r\n7. It must be said, Bannerhealth must undergo much closer scrutiny by both federal and state  regulators, patient advocacy organizations, academic accreditation organizations and professional physician groups. Why? Behind its veneer of accolades and dashboards (that are reaching its goals), it merely takes interviewing its frontline current and past workers, physicians and ancillary staff, to reveal  patterns of a dysfunctional system- a behemoth organization that barely keeps alive, and is \"too big to fail\" since it will become Arizona's largest employer and lifeline for training medical students and doctors from its only allopathic medical school."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "What I feel was said outloud.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Sept 2012", "job_title": "Or RN in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good, hard working, dedicated employees.

Anyone you think of as a friend will turn on you in a heartbeat to save their own butt/job and 4- don't ask questions even if you have absolutely no idea what the hell you are doing. IF you ask a question you will be viewed as incompetent and made to feel that way not just once...but on a daily basis. If I had known what a mess of a company I was going to work for I would have said hell no and run away screaming. Do yourself a favor...don't waste your time here.

(Google Peter Fine, Premeir). This company, Premier, is paid a handsome sum to meet with senior managers and directors within hospitals and formulate ways to make the work staff more productive. Unfortunately, the more \"productive\" the staff shows itself to be, the more productive the company pushes them to be. Over the years, managers are pushing their employees to work faster (not better), with fewer staff members (cheaper) and with fewer resources (reduced overhead). During this same period of time (since the recession hit in 2008-2009) our evaluations and infrequent and minute \"raises\" (approximately 1-3%) are based on patient satisfaction of the hospital as a whole. Only if the entire hospital receives a satisfaction score of 9 out of 10 or greater do we even register as passable. So given staff is being pushed to give superior service with fewer resources and for less monetary gain, staff are being pushed to the point of exhaustion and disgust. There is little one can do to be considered \"outstanding\" within the current evaluation system; therefore no matter how much we love our patients and put in 110% to our roles, we are expected to operate in a system that makes you feel inadequate. We understand that healthcare costs have gone up, and that nursing and support staff are considered a cost as well, but nurses cannot be expected to give and give with little financial reward.  If only nursing and support staff were valued even a fraction as highly as \"Executive Administrators\" and these \"productivity\" consultants, Banner would be a better place to work. The message relayed to the workers comes across as one of Banner's belt-tightening and lack of dollars to pay its staff, however they have purchased three hospitals in the last 18 months, \"investing\" hundreds of millions of dollars and performing never-ending construction projects on the hospital I currently work for (Banner Desert). The members of the Old Boys' Club and the owners of the Construction Company are making out pretty well in Banner's latest investments, yet patients are still left out of the equation. CEO and executive bonuses have continued throughout the recession even though employee pay has remained stagnant. Banner is considered a not-for-profit entity therefore its CEO bonus and salary should be available to the general public; good luck finding the information anywhere within or outside of the system. This just underlines my thoughts on how profit-driven this company is."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Transferring employee", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jul 2015", "job_title": "PET/CT Technologist in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the largest healthcare providers in the Phoenix area\r\nGreat benefits and hours, IF you can get hired into where you want to go!", "cons": "Hiring staff and recruiters do a horrible job of finding qualified applicants, and will consider people who do not meet the minimum requirements over someone with little experience who does."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Summarization for Banner Health's Failures", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Feb 2010", "job_title": " in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay: The pay is pretty good, although I have heard a lot of complaints about the 2% pay increase cap.

This is not true of all departments though. \r\n\r\nLocation: It's super close to my house and right off the freeway.\r\n\r\nCo-Worker Competence: I have had some horrible people that have worked with me; however, I have had some great people too. It seems pretty difficult to get fired from here. You'd be amazed what people get away with here!", "cons": "Respect: My manager is a great manager; however, our SCM and Director couldn't care less for us and see us as expendable. We were actually told that the next person to make a mistake in our department would be \"thrown into hot oil.\" This was the first meeting with our department after we had made one billing mistake in 3 months.  Since that time (and prior to) we have never heard any words of encouragement from anyone other than our direct manager. \r\n\r\nBenefits: This is an extremely sore spot with me. I came to Banner Health because I was interested in their benefits, mainly the Tuition Reimbursement plan. Banner paid for 1 year of Nursing school then they told me that 1) they wouldn't pay for my LPN and 2)I had too much time before I completed and they denied my reimbursement. (I had only 2 semesters left to my RN and had already completed my LPN - which they paid for already.) I requested an appeal and was denied with no reason. I applied again for my last semester of Nursing School and was told it wasn't part of their \"Strategic Initiatives\" and denied my request again and told that everyone who wasn't in a BSN program was being denied. (This was from our SCM who took a class on what lies to tell everyone that was denied.) Also, when I was hired, tuition reimbursement was for everyone. Now you have to apply by a ridiculous deadline with tons of paperwork and signatures then they require a contract for anyone who receives reimbursement. Sorry, I don't want my education paid for that bad. \r\n\r\nMedical benefits are a joke here as well. I pay more than I paid for United Healthcare and Cigna with other employers. Plus, the Banner Network is extremely rigid! There aren't very many providers to choose from and you must go to a Banner facility or you will . I pay more for specialists, inpatient hospital stays, diagnostic tests, physical therapy, than my friends who have insurance through their employers. Everything requires prior authorization and it took me 1 year for my Dr. to get me cleared to have Singulair for my asthma (which they only authorized for 1 yr)!!! I also have back issues and they denied my claim for a portable electrical stimulation machine after I had it for (& they'd paid for it) 8 months and it was the only thing (minus meds) that gives me any relief. \r\n\r\nJob Security: They think you're expentable in the clinical area while my area not so much since most people are new. \r\n\r\nCareer Potential/Growth: In my current department, there is no future. Supposedly, the clinical areas have more opportunity, but I see that it's all very political and definitely not where I will be. For me, I am just using this place to get enough experience to go somewhere better.\r\n\r\nWork Environment: My department is crap in this area. We are lucky to get pencils/pens! We seriously have to beg for post-it notes or steal them from other departments. We also don't get to use our budget for employee morale boosters like in other areas. \r\n\r\nSummary: As long as you come to Banner realizing that they don't care about you, I would recommend the experience you can receive here. If you can't get hired at any better hospitals, Good Sam is not the worst one out there. Just realize most \"benefits\" you get won't live up to what they're touted as. I am using Good Sam for what I can get then jumping ship as soon as I am able to get into a better hospital. Hopefully soon so I can have my BSN paid for!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Rehab Tech in Sun City West, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you have the right boss and atmosphere your experience at Banner will be great.

Because it's not here in Phoenix.  \r\n\r\nNurses are treated poorly, management doesn't seem to care about their staff as people.  They only see us as cogs in the wheel.  And if something is not perfect, then that person is out on their buttocks faster than you can blink.  Also there is almost no nursing education offerings that provide CEUs offered by live people.  No conferences, no classes, no instruction for an hour on treatments that can benefit the nurse and the patient.  All continuing education is to be done on Nurse.com.  Sure Banner pays for it.  But they all require just reading very easy, uninformative CEU's.  When I did mine, I just answered the questions. or watched the video (or Fast forwarded it to the end)\r\n  I didn't need to read the article.  They are too basic.  There is no consideration to providing real seminars or such for actual learning.  I admit, twice this past year there a class each for nurses, and others, that did not offer CEU's and were offered at distant facilities during times when most nurses would not be able to attend or arrive on time. And they are not presented by leaders in the field, but by some person working on her Master's in Nursing, or a staff nurse.  As well, there is no sponsorship provided by Baner for outside experts to come and present CEU classes.  No days are provided as education days.  One must take vacation days to attend one.  And the time off is so lacking, that you might never want to try to keep up your nursing skills, just so you can get a day off! \r\n\r\nNo one at the hospitals or corporate offices are interested in providing quality learning experiences for anyone.   \r\n\r\nBanner is a lousy place to work unless all you want is a paycheck.  And even then, you had better not want one that provides for any quality standard of living!  The pitiful raises each year, if they offer them, don't even cover the cost of benefits increase or the cost of living increases.  The upper management cares about no one but themselves.  \r\n\r\nBeing a \"right to work\" state is an absolute determent to the nurses in this city and state.  One is taken advantage by Banner, never properly thanked for your hard work.  And then they look for something on ti hystuft  firing you.

They use on-line surveys that employees are to complete after being told what to say by their managers.  And then, their egos are so big, when they don't get the great scores they think they deserve, they chastise the staff.  \r\n\r\nDon't work there, if only to get by to getting a better job.

The nurse managers are oblivious and couldn't care less about what actually goes on except to nit pick about little things like \"don't eat at the nurse's station\", which we are forced to do at times because it's so busy. \r\n\r\nThis place does not invest in its staff, which is its first and best resource, so people are unhappy and leaving, especially on 9ACD."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "I've never been so miserable at a job.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Apr 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is decent.
