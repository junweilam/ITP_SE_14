I was brought in as a college graduate, a fast-learner and a determined worker into a new field I was to be trained in. Sterile Processing is not easy, but it is significant in the safety of patients in surgical and diagnostic procedures. I was trained for two weeks, and the management changed. This wouldn't be a problem normally, but instead of finding a new leader, I was left to a kind but elderly co-worker who was nearing retirement in a physically and mentally demanding job, to be trained while on the job. Mistakes are potentially life-threatening if not caught, and with the workload continuing as 'normal', this was more than a challenge. This co-worker chose not to wear a mask during the height of COVID-19 in a HOSPITAL setting, in close quarters with me in our department despite my worries contracting COVID and potentially spreading to my immunocompromised family that I had made clear previously many times. She contracted COVID-19. She was subsequently gone for months. With about a month of training (which is not enough for such a clinical setting with so many complicated and important processes), I was left alone in the Sterile Processing Department and expected to perform the duties perfectly, as patient's lives were on the line (we are INFECTION PREVENTION). They brought over a manager from McKey, who stayed in the office all day rather than help me prepare for surgeries and perform my duties that were so extensive, I was working ten to twelve hour days on a regular just to try and keep up with daily surgeries that were scheduled. My compensation does not change throughout this, mind you. I am on call 24/7, 7 days a week, at $2 an hour BEFORE tax. I ask my temporary manager if I could have one Saturday off, if someone from McKey, who have refused to come help, could take my on-call. It is made clear this is \"very difficult\" for her to do, that I am an inconvenience. Just like when I come back from the bathroom after holding it all morning for her to inquire where I was, or condescendingly say, \"Oh THERE you are.\" as if I am not holding the department up on my shoulders alone. Don't you dare try and take a fifteen minute break, even if it's legal and in the handbook. You'll regret the passive aggressiveness thrown back at you. Prepare to be uncomfortable, the scrub techs are just generally unsanitary, which is upsettingly ironic, and it is clear with how they talk about patients and take everything with a dose of lackadaisical nonchalance that your family member on the table means absolutely nothing to them. In Sterile Processing, cleaning takes a \"three sink\" process, one for initial wash and scrub, another for soak, and the last for rinse (usually with reverse-osmosis water). This facility has two sinks. One in which I was expected to work, while next to me someone from the G.I lab cleans a colonoscopy scope within inches of each other. Disgusting does not begin to describe this practice. The washers are clunky and old, they opened up right to my desk so I got to enjoy a nice near-burning steam cloud every half hour or so if I didn't realize it was about to open and time myself right to move. The room is left hot, and then with all the machinery going, it's boiling and nauseating. It is not made for functionality for anyone or anything, and it's a miracle any instruments are processed correctly with how little time or funds go into this department--so if your family member contracts an infection, don't be surprised. Joint Commission didn't visit on normal terms due to the pandemic, but if they'd made it while I was there, they would've had a fit and the hospital would no doubt have been shut down from this department alone. Don't bother talking to the management, including the person above the supervisor. I was told in two different meetings I had to schedule that it was just \"hard to find people right now\", as if this were a fast food restaurant and not a medical facility with peoples lives and quality of life at stake. They will suck the life out of you. Your time, your effort, your care for others until you have nothing but an empty shell of yourself left--and then they'll have you stay longer so your manager can go home. I have never left a job same-day. I have never left a job in sobs either. I was berated, yelled at (screamed at, really, it's a miracle half the hospital didn't hear), gaslit and told it was my fault the surgeries would be cancelled for the week--as if it wasn't their fault for not hiring or having help come over to make this place function. My physical and mental health took a toll, to say the least, and to say they do not care is an understatement. They'd rather have a zombie body there to put the blame on when they eventually get into trouble for their negligence, than make an effort to keep patients safe and employees want to stay. This is all besides the fact every person I've ever known who has been a patient at this location has had near-death experiences due to their lack of care in every sector.

The tech managers have no idea what their employees jobs actually entail and constantly change the workflow without speaking to those that do the job.

only 1 or 2 housekeepers actually worked well; zero hazard pay during the pandemic whatsoever; working as a floor nurse there for 2 years is practically considered a veteran; holds a charity period every year to have the staff raise money for their own employees (I know other systems do it but I think it\u2019s a stupid concept to keep the system from taking care of its employees\u2014-nonprofit status is a joke)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The Right Stuff", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Remote Services Technician in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great diversity , broad range education.", "cons": "They strongly support female leadership"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Productivity Expectations Ridiculous", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 May 2021", "job_title": "Speech Language Pathologist in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Surrounded by competent, dedicated colleagues, time and half for holidays", "cons": "Have to work some holidays, pay raises are small and your productivity is a huge part of it."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Sun City West, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Match 401k up to 5%", "cons": "Does not work to help employee further education very much."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "n/a", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Scheduler in Mesa, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary is good for a scheduler", "cons": "Our holidays are paid by our PTO and it is mandatory."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "5 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Mesa, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are many opportunites, you just need to work for them", "cons": "None.
