However, the general feeling, and my personal experience, is that HR is there ONLY to protect the Institute.  There is no one, no department, no advocate, to protect or stand up for the staff.  When disputes arise between a staff member and a his/her supervisor, involvement with HR will always end with a negative result for the staff member.  In addition, promotions have become nearly impossible to achieve.  Deans and vice presidents have lost the power to promote their own staff.  HR controls promotions under the guise of reviewing/writing properly worded Position Management Tools, a process that is painfully slow and detailed.  Annual pay raises for staff members are usually between 2 and 3 percent.  In recent years this not only lags behind a cost of living raise, but with the poor salaries that staff members are paid, it doesn't even keep up with the additional cost of putting gas in your car.
