They have excessively restrictive HR policies for employees.  Bullying and threatening to \"take you off the schedule\" are routinely used to get people to attend meetings, educational training and other events.  Most hospitals will offer the previously mentioned events to health care workers at different days and times to allow for those who work off-shifts to attend.  Whittier offers them one day, at one time, and threatens you if you don't go.\r\n\r\nWhen new nurses are hired, they are not told that they need to sign a 2-year contract that states if they leave before the contract expires, they need to pay the hospital $5000 dollars.  This contract is presented to them AFTER they are hired, and are in new employee orientation!  \r\n\r\nYou also need to sign a pre-dispute arbitration agreement.  This means that if you have issues with the company, like being injured on the job or harassment or being fired unfairly, you can't sue them in a court of law.  Your only option is arbitration.  (FYI: do some homework....over 90% of cases that go to arbitration are settled in favor of the employer).  Again, you don't find out about this until after you are hired and also in new employee orientation. \r\n\r\nOnly one health care plan is offered.  It's a $4,000 deductible plan.  In order to receive full-time employer contribution to the plan, you must work 40 hours per week.  Most hospitals in this area consider 32 hours a week as eligibility for full-time employer contribution.\r\n\r\nThere are serious patient care problems related to inadequate staffing.  Sometimes nurses and nurses\u2019 aide\u2019s shifts are cancelled on them if management feels it isn't busy enough.  Sometimes when staff calls in sick, little or no effort is made to get replacements, even when it is busy enough.  Patients suffer for this, and it's frustrating when you don't have enough time to take care of patients in a manner that satisfies your personal standards.  They are more concerned with keeping costs down than they are concerned with patient safety and quality of care.  I have heard repeatedly that they will not pay overtime, even when it should be justified.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on and give examples of the disrespect shown to staff, but I think what I've mentioned above should be enough to give readers a clue about what they'd be up against if they worked here."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Overall, a good workplace", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Staff RN in Westborough, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "DON is a consummate professional, easy to approach, shows no favoritism.
