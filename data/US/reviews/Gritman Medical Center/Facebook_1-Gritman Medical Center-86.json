Overtime is not only frequent but encourgaed for most, if not all, employees. You will find yourself working more and still making less. Managerial decisions on workflows often result in poor patient care, creating upset patients that you will have to deal with. Chronic understaffing and high turnover create a work environment where you will have to do more than your job description.
