Be related to someone in administration or at least go to their church.  Positions have been created out of thin air for people who fit this description.  It felt like they were constantly announcing a new Associate Vice President for Blah, blah, blah, while other lower level faculty and staff were being pushed into buy-outs and early retirement.  Upper administration has run the university into the ground.  In addition to cutting staff, the university insurance, which wasn't great to begin with, has gone from a 80/20 copay to a 70/30.  The president used to like to insult our intelligence by starting his talks by reading headlines about bad things happening at other universities to \"soften the blow\" when he got around to announcing pay freezes, benefit cuts, etc.  The university is also schizophrenic in its vision-- pandering to evangelical parents on the one hand while many far left professors do everything they can to weaken or tear down the faith of the students on the other.  Unless you're related to someone here, or you're willing to cynically choose your place of worship to further your career path, I definitely do not recommend GWU."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "10 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Associate Professor in Boiling Springs, Cleveland, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong student-centered collegial community, beautiful campus, perfect place to live", "cons": "HR & Administrative Support can be lacking"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Director of Admissions", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "6 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Boiling Springs, Cherokee, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It was somewhat of a family environment.
