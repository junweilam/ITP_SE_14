Most of the best people I was working with left that hospital due to the terrible structure there. The last manager I know to be working there, is still currently. If you're ever in their office with them and you have a smart phone, leave it on record. They tried to get me to draw labs off the clock. I'd have put in a complaint if I didn't fall out of work from an anxiety attack and a middle ear infection, I couldn't get any doctors in the network to help me with. \r\n\r\nInsurance there is crap if they want to network together to get you out of the hospital. There's no protective PTO. Only PTO. You can apply for STD (Short Term Disability and/or LTD (Long term Disability) when you've been there about a year. The current manager there wants you to get 4 draws an hour after you've been there a year. After the year mark, they want you to be able to draw 6 an hour. After that 8 an hour. At least stay here no more than 2 months. Get the experience and then get out. \r\n\r\nIf you're there by the time you can draw babies, they already know your weaknesses and you'll be out of there before you can transfer. I miss being a phlebotomist and I miss the patient interactions, but if I can't get a job with another company, and there's a potential I could become homeless soon, I'm making sure potential candidates know of what toxicity they're walking into. If I could report them to the BBB, I would. \r\n\r\nThere's this odd feeling, when you go to numerous Southwest ENT specialists and a handful of Kettering On Demand doctors and they all fail to give antibiotics eardrops for an ear infection. I can see where hospitals can be a potential problem with sex trafficking or even black market sales. The hospitals have all your information. If you have a disorder or a disability, they could use that to their advantage to cause you to stay sick, drop out of work so you can't get work and become homeless. I was a very good worker. \r\n\r\nThere on time. Treated and trained the other phlebotomists well. Was bullied and punched in the side of my ribcage by a nurse I absolutely didn't know. I didn't do anything or know anyone there to deserve that kind of treatment. There was a lot of extra work put onto the staff while management racks up enough pto, they're only in the office 4 days a week. There's more dumped onto the little guy, so there's no teamwork at all like the billboards claim. \r\n\r\nAlso, you basically can't get an exemption with the covid vaccine. I tried to do a medical exemption and a religious exemption. For anyone who needs a genuine Christian religious exemption: Use the commandment on theft. They're stealing your right to keep your body as a temple from a foreign vaccine. \r\n\r\nUse the words \"covid vaccine\" throughout the whole religious exemption form. If you just put the word vaccine on the religious exemption form, they will turn down the exemption, claiming that it sounds like an exemption from all vaccines, when the exemption form clearly states exemption from the covid vaccine. You really have to be very specific to include the word covid or else they will deny your religious exemption."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Profits always come first", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Kettering, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity for gaining nursing experience is abundant", "cons": "While trying to promote a positive culture, the network more or less promotes a put on a happy face and bear it all atmosphere.

In addition, you cannot request time off in advance unless you have already banked/accrued the PTO hours. -Another words, you cannot request PTO for schedule time off, months in advance for future dates (planned vacation/cruise etc.), because you may not have accrued all the hours yet, although, by the time that future date rolls around, you will. -Poor work/life balance. -Gossip and unfair disadvantages/discrimination from management.

The overall culture on the nursing floors does not support or parallel the Religious (kind caring good) environment and culture portrayed by the orientation/business process. Very clicky. I thought it was my dream job and I was wrong. I was there 6 months and loved it so much. I was doing very well and was solely responsible for initial life savings decisions on several patients during my time there. I had no problems not even a single tardy, nothing. \nA couple women decided they didn\u2019t like me (I thought everyone liked me enough as I am very helpful, friendly and kind), and they fabricated something to the mgmt. This was confirmed later by 2 employees including a supervisor in a private message to me. The next week NM pulled me into her office asking me strange questions which I answered, to later find that she used those questions against me as she presented information she obtained from my charting and locators. I was as honest as I could be and explained everything in my reasoning and defense (for example, a Med scanner wasn\u2019t working in a certain room and she asked why I manually entered a routine medication prior to my locator showing I entered the room. I explained that I HAD entered the room prior and the locator must have not picked up at that time, as they often do, and that the scanner is broken in this room, and that I have had the patient all week and know them very well and that if there were to be an error or dropped the med it is easy to make the correction in the MAR for accuracy and pt safety of the record. She was not satisfied with anything I said. This is one example of literally at least 10 similar things that are average and common issues in nursing. Also, NO patients were harmed at all or were ever in a possibility of being harmed. She simply did not accept my answers). She told me she \u201cHAD to report it to HR\u201d which is incorrect, as it is up to mgmt to handle such affairs and discipline staff within policy. I was suspended from work 9 days without a phone call from mgmt or HR. I was NEVER contacted by HR, I was never able to explain my side of the story or accusations against me. I was wrongfully terminated and am unable to work in any KHN facility which rules out half the jobs in my city (and I am actually a great nurse who actually wants to be at bedside). I spoke with 2 lawyers who both said this was indeed wrongful termination and defamation of character. They said because OHIO is an at will employment state, that is why there is nothing I can really do unless they prevented me from getting another job elsewhere. \nI also had 3 instances of staff members who openly claimed to be \u201cpagans\u201d/\u201cwitches\u201d (no I am not joking), do and say weird things to me without reason or provocation, such as \u201cbeware when a witch points at you\u201d after they were pointing at me, and I went to see what they needed. Just weird!! I also had to assist patients that were being neglected by other nurses (alarms and lights going off too long) and yet I did not try to ruin anyone\u2019s livelihood or reputation.
