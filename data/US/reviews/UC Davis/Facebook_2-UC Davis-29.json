The primary reason to ignore earning little to no income during an internship is the knowledge of gaining actual work experience in a field you\u2019re interested in. You\u2019ll receive first-hand experience in a business-setting, putting you one step ahead of the game come the post-graduation job hunt.\r\n\r\nResume Enhancer. Employers are more likely to hire a graduate with the word \u2018internship\u2019 highlighted on their resume than those without. Taking an internship shows work ethic and a dedication to your career which employers find appealing.\r\n\r\nInteresting. Due to the variety of tasks and projects you\u2019ll be involved in as an intern, the work will never be dull.\r\n\r\nCareer Compass. As an intern, you\u2019ll likely work with a variety of people in a number of different departments, helping you hone in on what you do and do not want to pursue in your career after graduation.\r\n\r\nNetworking. You\u2019ll amass a decent rolodex after completing an internship, including a number of professionals who can help point you in the direction of a job opportunity or further connect you with the people who can.\r\n\r\nJob Offer.

Most internships pay little or not at all, making it difficult for those without a wealthy benefactor to justify the opportunity cost of wages earned with paid work during the time period of the unpaid internship. This point is particularly poignant for those acquiring a sizable amount of student loan debt upon graduating.\r\n\r\nInequality. It is likely an intern will not be seen as an equal member of the staff due to the unpaid status. It is also difficult to shake off the label of intern when interacting with co-workers, even if an intern is offered a paid position at the conclusion of the internship.\r\n\r\nNo Focus. With the volume of tasks divvied out to interns and the varying nature of those tasks, it can be difficult to find a focus and goal throughout the internship.\r\n\r\nMenial Work. The tasks assigned to interns are generally basic, low-skill duties, which rarely utilize the progressive skill level of the individual. While some internships provide an atmosphere for interns to put their specialty to use, most interns will acquire knowledge and experience relevant to their expertise by observing the paid
