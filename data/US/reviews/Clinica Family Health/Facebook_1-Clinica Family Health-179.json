Even a promotion to Assistant or Director of Nursing will have even less direct patient care. Again, this is perfect for older, close to retiring nurses as your nursing theory and assessment skills will diminish thus limiting your hiring potential outside of IM.\nSaid redundancy leads to a high incidence of lateral bullying, ostracizing co workers, including new and newly hired RNs to the point of a very high turnover. Bullying to the point of firing, or an inability to retain, extremely bright and promising talent hidden as new grads.\nI agree with the testimony below of not encouraging New Grads (RNs or MAs) to apply.
