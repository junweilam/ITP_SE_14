Just mentioning the name Penn State will often get you some respect/credibility from most of those living in the US.\r\n\r\nRetirement. Hop on the state SERS plan. It's a state-funded employee retirement system that has some very good fail-safes in place. Financial gurus might argue for or against it, but for the average person out there, it's a good retirement plan to adopt. Of course you have to keep working for a Pennsylvania state agency to keep contributing to it, but it should be there in force when you retire. For those entertaining the idea of working at Penn State, please keep in mind that there are other private-sector retirement plans to choose from (you're not locked into SERS).\r\n\r\nLiberal vacation and sick leave. Penn State gives employees a lot of leeway in helping them balance work and their personal lives.\r\n\r\nResearch is king here.

The university has expanded beyond academics. They've utilized the power of their resources and branding to build a business and groundwork that underpins the traditional higher-education role. The academic and business sides of Penn State are now joined at the hip. They support one another. From Penn State University and branch campuses to Penn State Hershey and countless contracting services, that diverse framework helps us overcome recessions and funding downgrades.\r\n\r\nFootball and other athletic sports. This university dumps a lot into its Nittany Lions and athletic teams. If you're a fan of any sport, Penn State probably has you covered. The fan following stretches throughout Pennsylvania, and even into other states. So if you want to be at the heart of it, you'll be working for the right employer.", "cons": "Penn State knows they're the primary employer in State College, let alone Centre County. Therefore they have a lot of leverage in dictating standards for pay and benefits. With that said, don't get me wrong, the benefits are good and the pay is very fair. But still, this bargaining chap of theirs has dampened larger corporations from dropping roots in Centre County and competing with Penn State for educated employees. And Penn State knows this. It's not necessarily their fault, but they take full advantage of it.\r\n\r\nNo ladder climbing here. I've learned that the best way to build your career and advanced at Penn State is to quite your current job and start another. Seriously. Advancement is laden with so much red tape that you'll be paddling at the same position for years until you even get the most narrow window to advance. It doesn't matter how well you preform or what level of ambition and dedication you have, once you start working here, you're stuck in that position until someone else takes pity on you and recommends some sort of promotion.\r\n\r\nRed tape. There's a ton of it. You can't sneeze on a form without jumping through hoops to get it approved and sent through the proper channels. Some entities and departments have it easier than others. For example, my entity only has to deal with Penn State for HR and Networking/Phone, so we have it easy compared to others.\r\n\r\nThe culture: liberal BS that started in the 90s but continues and is even worse today. I'm talking about the hyper-sensitivity to office-place harassment, diversity & diversity training, hyper-environmentalism, \"Penn State Recycles\", and now the child safety documentation and exam we must process thanks to the reaction to Sandusky's perversion and torment of children. These liberal policies has completely changed departments of Penn State. One example is Purchasing. It's not just \"Purchasing\" anymore, it's \"Supplier Diversity and Environmentally Responsible Purchasing\". Yeah, that liberal BS is rampant in academia, but it's especially repulsive at Penn State. If you love hugging trees, proudly drive a hybrid or electric vehicle, and talk about your carbon footprint, then these policies may be a pro instead of a con. Either way, Penn State hemorrhages this stuff, so be warned. I've had to play along and keep a smile on my face through all of this. It's a little stifling, but it keeps you from being on the receiving end of these liberal policies.\r\n\r\nParking for employees can be a nightmare for some. You can only park in certain lots, and the parking fees come out of your salary. Worse, because this is a liberal campus, they really frown upon auto-based traffic while encouraging bicycle and pedestrian traffic. That's why driving and parking on campus is a royal PITA. If you do work here or plan to work here, then I hope you can work off-campus, where this won't be as great a concern. And remember, parking for those of significant clout (the higher-up positions) is fine. It's the rest of us who have to put up with poor parking, especially if you're unlucky enough to be quite far from a parking garage.\r\n\r\nComputing. Nazi-like control over their networking/computing. If you're part of an entity that's separated from the campus, you may have more wiggle room, but if you're right on campus expect to have little computing flexibility. Granted, some corporations are even worse, but for a university, they're very strict. If you need any special privileges or functionality in your computing tasks, expect to wade through the red tape... that is if you're lucky enough to get approval for those exceptions."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Overall great place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Director of Development in State College, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Community is tight knit, family oriented, diverse and the area is really beautiful.

During that time, i dismissed some of the following information as no big deal, but the issues kept piling on top of one another, I couldn't help but lose any and all motivation to continue my high performance. If you don't value your employees and their contributions, they will find somewhere else that does! At the office of physical plant, not many people  care about making things better. Most are content doing things the way they've always been done. As long as kids want to go to Penn State, we get paid, so why bother putting in any extra effort? OPP says it values employees and wants to make things more efficient, but many decisions that are made go against best practice and efficiency. Incompetence gets rewarded, especially if you make friends in the right places. People take multiple hours for lunch, are on personal calls all day, and don't get their work finished yet they still get promoted. Working hard and exceeding expectations gets you nowhere and barely a thank you for your contribution. People will intentionally make you look bad if they don't like you, which has happened to to me as well as other coworkers. Some managers and directors only care about looking good to their superiors because their main concern is their own personal gain. If you don't follow the crowd and join the clique, you will be ostracized. I have asked mutiple people in leadership roles for various means of assistance in my career developmeny and I've gotten laughed at and scoffed at on multiple occasions. I have made suggestions and recommendations that were ignored but then implemented later as someone else's idea. I have received significant additional work and responsibilities but I was denied a pay increase and denied a job upgrade mutiple times. I was lied to on multiple occasions regarding my position by management and human resources. The office of physical plant at Penn state is the absolute worst cultural environment I have ever worked in. Do not work here if you are the kind of person that is an individual and not a follower who falls into the crowd. Do not work here if you like efficiency, fairness, accountability, respect, communication, and collaboration. If you are the kind of person that keeps your head down and follows the crowd, is very agreeable, and doesn't voice your concerns, you'll fit in with the clique and you'll be fine at the physical plant. If you're not one to ruffle feathers and you don't like making suggestions for improvement or pointing out flaws in a system or project, then OPP won't be all that bad for you. There are a ton of opportunities for advancement, but you'll only move up if you are able to successfully navigate the social and quasi-political network of ladders. Ability means very little in comparison to how much someone likes you or how they perceive you based on someone else's opinion. Furthermore, management will lie to employees or completely withhold information to avoid having to \"deal with\" people's reactions to change. Managers will completely ignore emails and will not respond, but will blame others for it. The lack of communication is disturbing and again, no one is held accountable."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Global, challenging, and inspiring.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Director of Alumni Career Services in Patton, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing professional development opportunities in the workplace and international cultural activities on campus continue to enhance my life-long learning adventures.", "cons": "The organizational culture can be inflexible at times as the staff sometimes struggles with adapting to change and working alongside true innovative thinkers.
