Our new Chief Operating Officer, Troy Dunmire, and the rest of our leadership was very transparent that there would be layoffs, and generally staff understood why that was necessary. The remaining staff worked harder than we ever have before, and it led the organization to fundraising highs, with some signature campaigns raising more than they ever did pre-pandemic. \n\nWe worked hard believing that there was an end in sight- that leadership was indeed aware of the fact that we were running extraordinarily lean and that we would receive the resources and staff we needed once we came out the other side. Well, we are out the other side, and leadership sees nothing but dollar signs in their eyes. I believe that this is because Troy brought over many of the people he used to work with at GAP, and they approach our organization like the retail establishment they came from.\n\nThey won't address our headcount, even when faced with severe employee burnout and a mass exodus of field staff. We're not asking for them to hire back every position that existed before the reorganization, but there are clear instances where one additional headcount would make all the difference.\n\nIt feels like a hard line to take - the less the organization spends on staff the more money goes to the mission, more money to the mission is a good thing. But this is short term thinking. When you lose field staff, you lose important relationships with community members who drive the revenue of the organization. When you place this much pressure on field staff, they leave faster. It all leads to a circular effect where in 5 to 10 years revenue has begun ticking in the wrong direction. We are not GAP store workers who are easily replaceable - we are more akin to professional sales staff with specialized knowledge. We deserve to be treated as such.\n\nIt is one thing to use the pandemic to realign focus, to shift resources to campaigns that are working and cut losses on campaigns that aren't. With one exception, we were not in that position. Pre-pandemic, LLS was a rocket ship to the moon - our campaigns were growing, volunteers had an excellent experience when they worked with us and wanted to continue engaging, and we were able to put more dollars than ever towards our important mission. I sincerely hope I am wrong, but with valuable staff members leaving in droves and the lack of caring that it seems Troy has for his remaining staff, it feels like we're about to take a slow but inevitable nosedive."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Chaos in constantly changing leadership", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Admirable mission for the organization, lots of time off, diverse, progressive leadership that genuinely cares about staff wellness", "cons": "Leaders in vital areas in HQ refuse to adopt to business processes, staff members with 10+ years prevent new staff hires from career success, poor culture, Chaos and Politics in HQ Creating Complacency"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Campaign Development Specialist", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life balance, passionate staff, solid benefits", "cons": "Lot of turnover.

I learned very quickly that LLS is an organization that works very hard to provide part-time, full-time and intern team members with unique experiences that help those individuals grow in their fields of interest. The best aspects of LLS were the people the mission brought together; through survivor stories and connections to staff who wanted more than a typical 9-5, I knew that when I was at the office I was surrounded by people who had their heart in the fight. I was promoted very quickly to lead my own campaign and found that while it was extremely difficult, the organization saw potential in me. This is a great stepping stone for those interested in working full-time in the nonprofit sector.", "cons": "The numbers, the numbers, the numbers. I got so tired of hearing \"do what drives revenue first,\" as it started to become this age-old saying that kept staff at the office until late hours, and Student Series staff driving on the roads for ridiculous KPI/quota achievements. It felt like leadership - locally - was not always willing to put up a fight against \"national standards\" that just didn't work in our region. It was as if when we formulated a recruitment plan/cultivation/stewardship strategy, we'd get a brief moment to entertain the thought until it was shut down completely by conflicting national priorities. Living through the recruitment cycle for schools was daunting enough, but the organization didn't do much in my view to support local chapters that had gone through natural disasters by adjusting KPIS or performance indicators. In some ways, this is good externally because I can say no nonprofit has ever pushed me this hard - which means staff members truly were being burnt out to the brink of leaving, and in essence this translated to getting as much value out of employees possible (positive use of donor dollars). But sometimes this was just overboard. When the organization decided that company-wide layoffs were on the horizon, the CEO's transparency was a nice respite from what had otherwise felt like large gaps in effective/genuine communication between lower level staff and national staff prior to COVID. DCEs (our regional oversight, working for national) were supportive to a degree, but also had their own priorities which made conversations about \"how is life\" feel largely artificial, and more like a report card check-in. To the point, why check in on your local staff and ask how they are doing when largely it's just a touchpoint for those individuals? I can say honestly I would not want to work in the Student Series department again having seen how heavy handed the numbers are, and with the rise of COVID-19, I worry that recruitment is a near impossibility. Meaning, if you apply for an LLS role related to school and youth initiatives, be extremely concerned for your job security. I was let go with nothing more to really do, as you can't raise money from schools with those schools closed. LLS is connected to its mission and uses the donor dollars well, but has a long way to go before earning 4 or 5 stars; middle management - even executive directors - need to prioritize the health of their local chapter staff before badgering them for monthly quota updates. I was extremely disappointed when I tried to have a heart to heart about career options and departure options with my manager, who shut me down very quickly and essentially asked \"why would we invest more time in you if you're just going to leave?\" That's no way to incentivize your staff to stay. All in all, if you're considering LLS, be cautious. You'll hear that the \"cure to cancer is in our blood\" as the mantra, but should consider that the blood, sweat and tears you put in may not (and likely won't) match up to the compensation and work/life balance you're working towards."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "LLS raises money for new drugs and therapies that are saving lives today", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Marketing Manager in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall good place to work.
