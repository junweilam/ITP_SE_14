I felt like I was living a real life version of mean girls  except everyone was older and would throw a temper tantrum if you were late one minute from lunch.  Understandable, but there are more important things to stress over, like maybe helping patients and arguing with insurance companies to get authorizations approved, but hey some people like to focus on their coworkers and literally document their every moves.  To each their own .  Also, the traditional 90 day new hire policy of learning and making mistakes does not apply here, you can be written up within the first two weeks for not knowing the rules by heart.  And by rules, I mean the ones that the manager feels like she wants to enforce that day, because they don't   Apply to all coworkers, just certain individuals who she is not fond of.
