So, faculty do not feel valued and do not have the comfort of job security, which makes for a very depressing work environment.\r\n\r\nThe administration constantly uses emotional and spiritual manipulation to get faculty to take on unfair burdens. When asked to do things that are outside their pay grade or expertise, faculty are told to embrace their calling from God, to show grace, and to be nimble. The administration doesn\u2019t hesitate to shame faculty into complying with their demands,\r\noften appealing to faculty\u2019s deeply felt religious convictions in order to coerce them. Dissenters and people who ask questions that expose the incompetence of the administration are not tolerated. \r\n\r\nThe pay is not adequate for everything that is asked of faculty.\r\n\r\nOn average, the students tend to be less mature and hardworking than students at other colleges and universities. Often, it feels more like teaching high school than teaching at the college level. \r\n\r\nFaculty have to sign onto three historical theological documents, some of which contain morally problematic implications that no faculty seem capable of fully defending."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Resident Assistant in Grand Rapids, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I like working as a Resident Assistant.
