Upper mgmt. is very very out of tune with what professionals need to provide safe healthcare. They are concerned with $$ instead of safe nurse to patient ratios, equipment, and safety. \r\n3. They call it a hospital (which it is ABSOLUTELY NOT, no ER, no ICU, and no means to take care of a patient if they should need immediate intensive care.) It is a surgi-center with hospital beds.\r\n4. Some patients are too acute to be cared for at Coordinated Health.

(This has been told to me by doctors, physician's assistants, and managers).\r\nAn example which occurred more than once was I'm caring for a patient who needed units of blood transfused from losing so much during spine surgery. The patient's blood pressure and pulse were erratic. I had no central blood pressure monitoring (A-line) to assess their hemodynamic stability, the patient nearly went into acute respiratory distress and we had to transfer the patient to LVH. This happened multiple times but not all of the same causes.\r\n5. Pay is sub-standard to other competing employers.\r\n6. Paid time off is 10 hours per month for full time employees.
