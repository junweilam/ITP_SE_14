They essentially run the facility and help keep it moving smoothly. \r\n\r\nSome AOP staff members have complained that they are given too much responsibility for the amount of pay they are given $12/hr, which is true. But ultimately, the job and leadership experience both of which look phenomenal on a resume are well worth the responsibility and little pay. Typically the coordinator who is the boss of the AOPs likes to hire new AOPs from already present staff, namely Member Services, but it is possible to be hired as an AOP upon initial hiring.\r\n\r\nAbove AOPs are the student supervisors of Member Services and Fitness. These student supervisors report \r\nto the adult coordinators of that particular section (i.e. Fitness Coordinator, Member Services Coordinator). They monitor the student staff and make sure they are doing their jobs correctly, and report their findings to their assigned coordinator. They are also responsible for doing office work. \r\n\r\nThey work around your student schedule; you give them your availability and they assign you shifts around it. You can work a maximum of $20/week.  And you additionally get paid for attending staff meetings.", "cons": "As previously stated, you are expected of a lot working at Campus Recreation and the pay to some may not seem fair. However, if you value gaining work experience, it is well worth it. \r\n\r\nWhen you first join Campus Recreation, there will likely be a staff wide meeting within the first few weeks of you getting hired and the coordinators are seemingly very welcoming and \"family\" oriented. This is mainly a ploy to increase worker morale. They ultimately do not really care about you. You are dispensable, there are hundreds of students that could take your job, and they know that. Most of the coordinators do not go out of their way to help you, and recently there has been a sudden influx of terminations and re-hires. To secure your position I recommend doing a lot of \"sucking up\", befriending your coordinator and supervisor, visiting their office to chat, ect."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "The campus is not only a great contribution to the the students, but also the faculty and staff who work there.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Lecturer in Pomona, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff/faculty in the biological department is very positive and supportive.", "cons": "If you work for a specific department, you will have a difficult time meeting individuals from other disciplines."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Working at Cal Poly Pomona has been like crashing onto a brick wall.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jul 2011", "job_title": " in Pomona, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the best reasons to work at Cal Poly Pomona are the benefits.
