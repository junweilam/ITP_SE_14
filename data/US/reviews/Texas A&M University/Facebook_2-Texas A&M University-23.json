I graduated in May and did not receive a promotion - merely remained part-time Helpdesk/Administrator. September 1 rolled around and they notified me I was being let go in a week. No correspondence as to why was ever given. Two weeks after I was let go they hired a new Administrator.

Supervisors, particularly those with tenure, are often allowed to bully, harass, exploit, disrespect, and abuse subordinate staff, sometimes for years and despite repeated complaints being filed. While there are resources available to address complaints, the process is time consuming (which compounds the problem in a hostile environment) and often the employee is either expected to kowtow to unreasonable demands and behavior or transfer out of or resign from an intolerable situation (which allows the problem to persist and adversely affect other employees). When a conflict exists between a staff member and a faculty supervisor, the ineffectiveness is extreme since Employee Relations' hands are essentially tied when it comes to addressing faculty members' abusive behavior. Supervisors with a history of complaints are allowed to continue largely unchecked as long as the employees are willing to accept a transfer or resign. Employees are often encouraged to try to resolve the problem themselves and are advised to try speaking with abusive supervisors who have threatened them since HR  cannot intervene on an employee's behalf when the conflict is with a faculty member. Dean of Faculties is willing to listen to complaints, but requires an inordinate amount of time to take action and can only encourage affected employees to \"wait and see\" for indefinite amounts of time in increasingly-hostile work environments while sustaining additional abuse at the hands of faulty supervisors."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great environment, good benefits, low pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "18 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Applications Security Engineer in College Station, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Texas A&M has a great overall atmosphere.

Others are nearing retirement and praying the place does not close before they can retire.  The remaining faculty are \"the one who took the job,\" or should I say, \"the warm body to fill the slot.\"  Many programs have insufficient faculty and the faculty who are present are either out-of-date, unskilled, uninformed, or just plain unbelievably bad.  The administration is uncreative and virtually incompentent for the exception of those who are absurdly corrupt.  Graduation is in the Baptist Church, led off by a prayer by the minister.   THis is not a place to start your career, but it is a place that could end your career.  The better the faculty member, the worse they are treated by the admin.  IF you attend the right church or grew up with an admin, you will likely be treated like a god.  The most talented people I knew there were actively applying for jobs, would get interviews, and mysteriously never get an offer... likely because the policy here is to give bad references to anyone who is a former or current employee.  Why?  because recruiting new faculty is absurdly difficult.  No one will take the job, and for good reason.  Most admin have no experience in academia.  The school has serious enrollment problems and has over-spent on a new campus for which the enrollment is not sufficent to support.  Students get a horrible education because the primary rule from admin to faculty is 100% retention.  Think about it.  How do you get 100% retention from a class of students who are largely enroll as a school of last resort?  Pass everyone.  We had one faculty member who was doing very good research and graduated students who were entering PHD programs, they kicked him out because he flunked some students.  Then, we had the other faculty member who was handed a program with in communications that had practically no students (fewer tahn 10).  that prof grew it, the student were getting jobs. They dumped her as she was not sufficiently corrupt.  Then we had the computer science prof who was doing a good job, was released and took a job at an R1. The majority of faculty have a very hard time finding another job because of bad-mouthing form higher-ups.  Some earn it, but those are VERY few and far between.
