Communication was awful, and I often heard about things from outside partners days or weeks after my colleagues knew. Trying to get responses on paperwork took days or weeks longer than it should have, making my first pay check late and reporting with outside partners late.\r\nAll of this might have been tolerable until I was sexually harassed by a member of the government department we worked with. I brought it to HR's attention, and they responded right away that we should have a meeting and that they would do something about it. That was the last I heard about it from them. As I was frequently in the government office without my team, I made sure to avoid this staff, even being rude when it was necessary to avoid him. When I brought the incident up in my exit interview, they claimed they had spoken to the government staff and had taken measures to prevent me from ever being alone with him. Maybe they did speak with him, but I had to make sure for myself that I was never alone with him, as my colleagues were rarely in the same office with me. When regional HR found out how the incident was handled, they arranged a meeting to assure me that they would do something and agreed to let me know what was done by emailing me at my personal email.

Global teams are supposed to support country team achieve the national priorities for their specific area of interest. \r\nWhat I am observing is totally different. Our global team has internal calls and meeting where strategies are set, we discuss with donors directly and only engage with countries late in the game. At that point, country offices have virtually no role to play, but open doors on the ground to global team members.. ambassadors of sort. Global team would then pitch their ideas to country\u2019s government mid-level or senior managers to ensure their ideas have \u201clocal buy-in\u201d. Then most of the work is done by global team members whether based in country or roving between several countries without involvement of almost anyone at the country level proper. In external forums, our leadership presents the data claiming it is based on countries\u2019 priorities and in response to countries\u2019 needs, while in reality, neither the country offices nor the countries proper really have any meaningful role to play, even less have any ownership of the work. This is even made worse by the high turnover in global teams which means any kind of continuity is lost. Turnover at CHAI is due to two main factors: burnout due to high stress with lack of coaching and poaching from other teams for projects suddenly deemed more important that month/quarter/semester.\r\nThe effect I saw on the country teams was devastating, they did not feel supported and had to use up their political capital for some obscure objective that only moved along some donor\u2019s agenda.  This is compounded by the fact that CHAI is promoting people at country level just for political reasons without the right skills or any clear performance evaluations.

At some point they have entire teams working on some obscure and ill-defined analysis that nobody understands and for which the purpose is not clear just to find out it was something that a donor had mentioned they would \"desire\". In one case, a team worked on a slide deck for over 6 months before they realized the donor had lost interest. \r\n- CHAI arbitrarily appoints new managers to lead some new political initiatives, driven mainly by donors that are connected to the leadership. New programs are setup up, new young motivated people appointed and given full autonomy on their programs. Usually, they lack program management experience, or any technical background (health system strengthening, PMTCT, Malaria, health financing, nutrition, hrh, etc, etc, etc.), leading to issues in working with partner or delivering impact.\r\n- New strategies or priorities just seem to spring up without clear communication on the rationale and why CHAI is best-suited to deliver or prepared as an organization to deploy teams that are enabled to be effective.\r\n- A model like where motivated a bright young people work hard and deliver results can work in consulting firms for example, but they always have strong guidance, from firm experts and more senior managers or partners. This does not happen at CHAI, where people cannot rely on anyone with strong functional or technical expertise, which too often leads them down the wrong path even though the original vision may have been good.\r\n- In addition to lack of mentorship, and/or safety net, people get regularly yelled at and verbally abused as if they were supposed to read the mind of the CEO or know what they were supposed to do, even though no information or guidance was provided to them.\r\n- Most of the people that get promoted (and not yelled at) are somehow connected to someone (related to a government official, related to a friend of the CEO, related to someone influential, etc.) while others are treated like they can be replaced in a whim (one of the CEO's favorite sentences \"do this or I will get somebody else that will\").\r\n- Financial management is rather creative and country offices do not follow accounting standards. In some offices, large sums are spent without proper justifications, receipts or even outside of what grant agreements require or are misallocated (look at the South African office, Tanzania and others). Other country offices play with the financials so that their number look good for the leadership (Kenya office moves around money and back-charges so that overhead is negative).\r\n- Problem-solving and open discussion is not the culture at CHAI. Nobody can engage in a constrictive dialogue with the CEO as he does not allow anyone to challenge his assumptions and ideas. This has led several program to collapse as initial hypotheses had not been challenged despite flaws being obvious to many. (In a recent meeting, the CEO said they would use the same strategy to bring down costs of vaccines as they had uses for ARVs, threatening to inundate the market with generics...which is obviously not realistically possible, but there was no debate as the discussion was cut short)\r\n- Too often, good people, good senior managers at CHAI are held responsible for something when in reality they have no power to influence things.

As a consequence, technical skills are really weak. Most people working at CHAI have no technical background. Promotion are based on politics. The CEO will typically appoint someone to lead an initiative based on who he wants promoted within the organization, not based on merit, results or effectiveness. Usually promotions are based on politics or personal connections. Some friend or government's official child or spouse needs a job? No problem, it sounds like they are going to be a great help for CHAI. The fact that they have no technical expertise or that they cannot lead a team is not a problem. Meanwhile, qualified, smart, motivated people are not promoted, which leads to high rates of turnover. Too bad turnover rates are not considered a problem at CHAI, but a normal part of the cycle.  \r\nThe current CEO is a political person, which is reflected within the organization. Even CHAI's impacts are becoming political. The CEO is more concerned by how CHAI will be perceived rather than how they are going to help patients. CHAI will trade-off quality for politics every time. If CHAI's activity may challenge a government official, CHAI will always give in to avoid any disagreements, even if it means the actual death of the program, or at least forfeiting the hopes of having meaningful and sustainable impact.  The CEO thinks that host government officials are always right and that saying otherwise would be neo-colonialist... Nobody is always right. Everyone needs a thought partner and needs to have a balanced opinion, check and balances. Constructive criticisms are good, they really help move the thinking to the next level. By trying to avoid conflict at all cost, CHAI has forfeited its role as a true partner. They have abandoned their staff and removed the possibility of having any true impact. In some cases, CHAI has given up on measuring true impact (no M&E plan) and instead claims that giving control of resources to host government is an impact in itself. This will sure make host government officials happy, but it this an impact in itself? Is this a guarantee of impact? The CEO certainly seems to think so....to the point that he does not advocate for any reporting or control mechanisms. People with US Government agencies who question this strategy are bullied and the CEO does not hesitate to brandish his political friendships to get his way. It is not uncommon to use political capital to get results, but in this case it is moving the organization away form being focused on results towards an organization that is satisfying the pride of one individual."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Ok", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great Mission and being able to fill I am doing more\r\n- Work is boring and repetitive but consistent", "cons": "- Difficult culture to get used to coming from corporate\r\n- There are many poor manager that could be improved\r\n- Focus on career development \r\n- No systems in place"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great for a short time", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cape Town", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- mostly fast paced work environment\r\n- opportunity to work with high level MOH stakeholders \r\n- some local, regional and global travel", "cons": "- unclear staffing model \r\n- limited room for growth in some countries\r\n- lack of transparency in salaries, and promotions"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "I ve worked for the corporation for the last 7years", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "career building is a priority,health insurance services offered &extended to the family. continuous trainings organized for staff.", "cons": "at times the set targets of a given period are relatively high & very unrealistic compared to the situation at hand"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Manager", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Special organisation with a great mission to strengthen the systems of the state to deliver better health services.
