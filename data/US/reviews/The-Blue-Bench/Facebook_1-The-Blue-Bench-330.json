In my experience, I was often very uncomfortable with the amount of pressure I was putting on strangers around a very sensitive topic at their own doorstep. You will be instructed to ignore 'no solicitation' signs as you will be told you are 'technically not a solicitor'. This instruction resulted in me being threatened with arrest and a firearm.

When those interactions significantly cut into my potential fundraising time, and therefor my potential earnings,  my metrics / quotas and compensation were not adjusted in any way. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou are not provided any consistent means of restroom usage.
