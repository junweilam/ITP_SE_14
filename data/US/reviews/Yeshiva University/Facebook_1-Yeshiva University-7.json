YU pitches itself as a University Education with a human  touch. But the work environment does just the opposite. People who go in with useful marketable skills. Over time, employees loose the ability to reason, to be motivated about their professions, and thus become useless to society, should they lose their jobs, which ultimately will happen.\r\n\r\nHow could it be like this? The upper management lives in its own hermetic bubble. Think Dr Sues'  \"Yertle the Turtle\" meets \"The emperor who has no clothes\"\r\n\r\nAt the highest levels of management, ill-advised decisions are made and promulgated down without regard for those who have to carry them out.\r\n\r\nFor example, in order to meet largely artificial deadlines, contractors had been called in. Often they do a poor job because they managed by those who don't know what they are doing and are not held accountable. When they leave, employees are expected to take things over and largely they can't because they are ill-trained and ill-equipped to do so. Since they didn't have any say in what was done, they aren't that motivated.\r\n\r\nLet me give an example here. I once had a manager where if I said, \"let's go right\" he'd say \"no, we'll go left\". If I say lets try this, he'd say, \"no I think that is better\" and so on. In many cases the differences the two were inconsequential. After a while, I would think, why bother offering a solution? Why put any emotional investment in any of this no matter how inconsequential?\r\n\r\nBut the brain is a use it or lose it kind of thing. I routinely asked software developers if they had any automated tests any of their code, and to my great surprise, one said \"I used to do that in a job before I started working here.\" She said this as a matter of fact not as a criticism. And if she started doing this practice on her own at YU, her manager wouldn't have understood it, let along be supportive of it. Tasks get passed down but it is very hard for ideas to percolate up. So after a while people just stop trying."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "It's diverse and great to work, lot of educational opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Apr 2013", "job_title": "Study Coordinator in Bronx, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the better employers in New York City.
