It\u2019s beautiful, I get to park in a covered garage and there\u2019s a Starbucks inside! Absolute heaven to an RN coming from a hospital that was in need of a makeover and we had to pay for parking. The hospital has a lot of resources for higher education and the staff are incredibly helpful and kind. Being new in a hospital is always difficult but every time I\u2019ve asked for help from a staff member in any given area I\u2019ve always been met with a smile and willingness to assist. I really love that.", "cons": "The ONLY reason I had to give this hospital 4/5 stars is the staffing issue. I know it\u2019s happening everywhere and this isn\u2019t specific to this hospital. However, the problem is no one from administration asks the nurses how to help solve this crisis. The nurses are seeing the effects of poor staffing and it\u2019s causing them to flee in droves. Retention rates are awful and it\u2019s no wonder why. My unit is a particularly vulnerable population and I thought going there would alleviate a lot of stresses of working in a hospital because they couldn\u2019t possibly be affected by this issue. That was very naive of me- it\u2019s everywhere. Two very easy examples but ones that NEVER want to be heard because they are expensive are MORE travelers and MORE part time positions. Nurses who are getting older or have families are begging for part time positions and they simply are not utilizing this. It would be SO helpful to fill in the gaps in staffing with part timers but we never seem to open these types of positions. It feels like the nurses are screaming in a crowded room and no one stops to listen. The answers are typically buying food and saying thank you but that isn\u2019t what we want. We want to take care of our patients- safely. Assignments that used to be a 1:1 meaning 1 nurse to 1 patient now are 1 nurse to 3 patients. It\u2019s stressful and leads to mistakes and carelessness, in any setting but especially an intensive care unit. Our nurses deserve better and our patients do too. If we don\u2019t take better care of our staff by giving them the help theyre actually asking for we\u2019re risking even higher rates of burnout. Real change begins with listening to the nurses. I hope to god they do, and soon."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good money horrible company", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in New Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay as a new grad was nice", "cons": "Short staff Cno Management Seniority vacation rules"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Patient Transporter in Somerville, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I loved the job, I worked well with my coworkers, and it was a nice experience overall.", "cons": "Some days were really busy and there wasn't much staff to help a few times."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Clinical care technician", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Clinical Care Technician in New Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff was great and the people I worked with made it fun.", "cons": "The unit I worked on was very heavy.

Current staff are jaded and want to do the bare minimum so you get frequent call outs and no shows...again leading to an understaffed department. The mobiles, which are suppose to help make things run quicker are useless especially since they malfunction frequently and have no internet access. Overall, the running of the department doesn\u2019t embody what I thought RWJ was all about and what I learned in the mandatory two-day orientation (again rubbish).
