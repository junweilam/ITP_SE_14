I worked as a Patient Care Tech definitely not a perfect environment, but at least management on the unit I was on attempted and had experience. PCTs do not make enough for everything they have to deal with. OSF does not utilize LPNs very well in the hospital setting. Pretty much the only way you can use your LPN in the hospital setting is if you work in the RT department. Since you can't work in ICU and Intermediate units you have more probability of being called off if overstaffed (hired too many travelers). If you were an RN/PCT you would be able to work on another unit, however, since OSF only utilizes LPNs in the hospital in this department, you can't work if the patient counts are down on the general floors. The education for LPNs is poor as well. I would not even attempt to go to urgent care as an LPN due to poor pay. If you went to school as an LPN, know your worth. OSF treat LPNs like they don't exist. The pay might look good but think about it before you sign on. If you want to try it out, DO NOT SPEND THE SIGN ON BONUS. You will have 30 days to pay OSF back if you get a new job somewhere else or cut your hours back. It WILL be sent to collections.
