Any employment found on campus makes the institution accessible and that is the real perk of working at SBTS.  You are where everything is happening.", "cons": "It is well known that SBTS has a natural and institutional division between faculty and administration. Most students and their families will only know professors and the classroom - faculty.  Far fewer will ever experience or understand what it is like to work behind the green curtain under the administration.  Senior administration is the true inner circle of SBTS. A fortunate few might just do enough to garner favor with the \"inner circle\" and be on the fast track to a career in administration. This is highly unlikely as the talent pool and competition is high.  The administration often operates with little external oversight (despite appearances) and veiled intent that breeds fear and false flattery in the internal work culture. Middle-managers are often concerned about losing their job and many have abruptly left their post with little warning. Some former employees have taken severance pay in exchange for signing a gag order concerning their termination.  Nothing scandalous had happened, but certainly SBTS wants to avoid any public scrutiny or negativity.  The employee compensation level is lower than average, especially when you consider the amount of hours salaried employees are working - more than 50.  Administration prides itself in getting quality work done for a whole lot less the price.  Senior administration, however, live comfortably and are well insulated from many of those worries or concerns.  Several members of the senior administration have no terminal degrees or investment in higher education.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but certainly worth noting. There is very little room for internal feedback or constructive criticism - no real open door policy."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible place to work - the worst place I've ever worked", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Nov 2011", "job_title": " in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only good reason to work at SBTS is because you believe in the mission and doctrinal stand of the school, which I do.
