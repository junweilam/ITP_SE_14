They also have a very collaborative mentality and not such a competitive one.", "cons": "- Pay is low\r\n- Rent is absolutely insane around here now\r\n- Dealing with bureaucratic hurdles is a nightmare at times\r\n- Graduate health insurance coverage is constantly changing and has awful service and a broken website (To give an idea.... the user login has been broken for years for many grad students. I have called several times w/ no solution so I haven't been able to login to view my my plan and costs for several years now.). Beware: They drop your dependants during the Summer unless you pay a lump sum of the Summer insurance cost at the very beginning of Summer. If your dependants are auto-dropped during Summer their medical claims will still accepted because LifeWise and UW don't keep the database up to date. This can leave you in a situation where you have to repay them in full later if you want to keep dependants on your insurance."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook":

What I loved about working at UW and the b-school:\r\n+There is a lot of organizational pride and external recognition when working for a well-known and respected university and top ranked business school. I loved the love and smiles I got when I told people in the community where I worked. It was always a conversations starter.\r\n+The campus is really beautiful and a nice place to work. Seeing students of all ages on a daily basis is energizing. It's great to be a part of someone's education and dreams. Many of my co-workers were in it for the mission and love of what higher ed stands for -- rather than money (goodness knows staff are not paid top dollar). Thus, there is a lot of passion for the work. While I went to college elsewhere, I got to be a Husky by profession. That was and still is cool! It's what I miss most.\r\n+Benefits are very  good and competitive with corporate jobs. \r\n+ There are lots of really smart people in a university and that raises the floor and the ceiling in terms of the quality of people attracted across every type of job. That's a powerful asset (sadly wasted -- see cons).\r\n+ Public transportation options are pretty good  \r\n+Diversity is cherished. I think UW in general and the b-school in particular truly do a lot to be inclusive regarding a wide range of individual differences. The one ironic exception (noted in cons) is discriminatory attitudes and treatment based on faculty/staff and union/nonunion labeling. Coming from the corporate world, this can be very off-putting.", "cons": "-Too much bureaucracy and politics in the University as a whole and in the b-school to allow for innovative thinking.  There are a lot of silos and a lot of places and ways for inept people to hide out. It becomes frustrating to see this dynamic after a while.\r\n-Faculty / staff status differences are very dysfunctional. Staff are second-class citizens -- even when they have advanced degrees and/or more real-world experience than faculty. The tenure system is also dysfunctional because faculty can  come and go as they please, telecommute, get the best parking -- while staff are seen as worker bees. There are different performance and retention standards for staff and faculty that reinforce faculty's view of themselves as superior. This is an ugly fact that just gets denied and ignored because the tenure system is so embedded in universities in the US. \r\n- Professional development is sub-par and not really encouraged, which is ironic for a University. Lack of upward mobility and career paths for staff was one reason I left.\r\n-UW has a number of unions for certain types of jobs. While I know its important to protect employee rights and collectively bargain for wages and wage equity and all that...there is a lot of dysfunction created when you have two classes of staff (union and nonunion) -- and adding in faculty as the \"upper class\" creates a very tiered status system. I've worked in large corporations with some unionized workers ... academia+unions creates a much worse hierarchy. Again, it's ironic that the unions actually perpetuate a we/they inequity and rank system rather than creating unity.  If you are looking to work anywhere in UW, you will need to be OK with this atmosphere.\r\n-Traffic and parking at UW has gotten significantly worse in recent years. My commute time increased to the point where I was spending about 3 hours a day in transit. That and the inability to telecommute (frowned upon in the b-school and required Dean's approval) was the final deal breaker for me.\r\n-The hiring systems is super slow. When I was trying to hire any new staff, things had to go through central HR before being posted. Often by the time I got the applicant list, the best candidates were no longer available. The b-school HR department was helpful, but at the mercy of central HR in terms of the process,\r\n-The B-school itself should practice more of what it preaches. There are distinct soloing, status and favoritism issues. There is a lot of room for improvement in terms of collaboration, innovation, openness to new ideas and courageous leadership. Rankings went up during my time there, but I saw other strategic goals go by the wayside because so much energy was focused on national rankings. It felt like there was opportunity left on the table because of this tunnel vision.\r\n-Funding for raises, promotions, training & development is a constant issue - particularly for staff. Most people in the b-school complained about being underpaid and overworked.  Even if you love higher ed and academia, that gets old.\r\n-There were a lot of dissatisfied employees who were sticking around because they liked being affiliated with UW and the b-school, liked having a job with good benefits and security, and liked some of their co-workers ... but complained a lot about leadership, the little untouchable empires or fiefdoms inside the school, the politics, etc. It is sad to see people feeling oppressed and stuck and just deciding to live with it because of the cache of working at a well-known b-school and much beloved university. I'll admit that I stayed much longer than was healthy for me and my family because of the cool-factor."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Dedicated to Mediocrity", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Technology Manager in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work/Life - pretty good.

PIs are typically relatively seasoned faculty with a solid publishing record, so they have the capacity to forefront a graduate student on a paper, and pay their way to some conferences -- as long as you do the analysis and contribute to the writing. In my experience, grad RAs often seem encouraged to take lead on papers - as long as something gets written and accepted and presented eventually. \r\n\r\nTime off: If you recommend yourself as a productive, reliable RA and develop a positive relationship with your PI, there is good chance s/he will have no problem letting you take a week or two off during the winter/spring breaks, and additional time off (perhaps a month) during the summer (especially if you are an international student needing to travel home to visit your family). \r\n\r\n\r\nOther pros:\r\n- You get to work with experienced, smart individuals with well-rounded life and work experiences. \r\n- You can find faculty who are naturally good mentors. It may take some looking, but they exist. Find one who is not an overachieving robot (good luck). \r\n- Beautiful campus setting, LOTS to do both on and off campus, lots of healthy options for taking the edge off.", "cons": "For a Graduate Research Assistant, you are on a half-time (50%) appointment. Pay varies by college, engineering, medicine an business pay more, which can make a difference between not making ends meet and barely making it.\r\n\r\nCompensation: $1600/month. Seattle is among top 10 cities in the US with the highest cost of living. Rent for a most basic, older, 600sqft 1 bedroom apt (no roommate) that doesn't require an hour-long commute is about $1000/mo, and that's a good deal. So you need to make it on $600/mo for everything else (food, utilities, clothes, supplies). \r\n\r\nWork-life balance: it is what you make of it. Quality papers require quality analysis and writing, which takes time. RA appointments tend to evolve from half-time into full-time, unofficially. If you plan to do quality work, you can forget about 8-5 workdays and free evenings. Welcome to the Midnight Oil Burning Club. \r\n\r\nAdvising: It works like this. UW is a research-intensive institution. This means that faculty are primarily evaluated based on ability to secure funding and ability to produce research output. Everything else is a distant non-priority when it comes to what really plays into their career growth. However, what plays into *your* career growth - what helps you make good decisions, get timely advice, and benefit from the wisdom of the more experienced senior researchers - is personal attention and basic human consideration. When you come to UW, you first and foremost subscribe to the culture of the place; the culture does not bend itself to cater to your needs for quality advising time and attention. \r\n\r\nSo you need to adjust expectations in this regard and either accept this limitation and forge ahead, or consider other schools where faculty care more about the welfare of their students -- not just hire them."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good and bad at the U--staff review (not faculty)", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Graphic Designer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really depends on your department.

Kuddos to the recruitment team. the problem is, the retention of these talents due to subpar academic institution environment including support of mainstream educational philosophies implemented at many progressive universities. \r\n\r\nMany separate schools/units/departments have been able to change their cultural for the better (Milgard School of Business; Academic Affairs; School of Engineering and technology); but the entire campus as a whole is divided and not moving towards the same direction. \r\n\r\nThe Chancellor and Vice Chancellors are top notch; although their vision and power is limited to reporting to the main UW campus in Seattle (UW Tacoma is considered a satellite and thus does not have authority to make some critical decisions; often having to check in with what is known as \"The Mothership.\")", "cons": "Outlook is grim for this campus; mostly due to individuals who believes that this is the \"University of Tacoma\" and not the University of Washington Tacoma. If you are looking at serving students so they can be global citizens, this is not the place for you. You will be locked into preparing students for a region that does not have the economic or educational mobility to succeed against students from other institutions. Theories and practices common are dated, like 1990's dated.\r\n\r\nThis campus, especially within Student Affairs is riddled with problems that stems back to days when two division were combined into one; which lead to animosity among \"team members\" as many upper level management were cut. This combine with subpar hiring of \"leaders\" who have no experience in higher education or clear vision/direction for their units have lead to frustration and often horrible customer service to students. When division leaders have to read a book on customer service, that is a red flag. Many students transfer after a quarter/year to the other two UW campuses as they feel that the service they are getting is subpar; and they are correct. \r\n\r\nAs students are transferring and choosing other schools, retention rate for this campus is low; which leads to budget cuts; which leads to lay-offs. Be sure to ask how you are funded (State; Student Fees; Grant), as this will greatly determine if you are inline to be cut if budget is an issue. \r\n\r\nThis is not a progressive environment, where students and staff are faced with microaggression constantly. It is so bad that a campus climate survey had to be conducted. Mid-level management lacks the skills to be fair and handle personnel issues, and often favors individuals. HR is useless, as they have to report to the main campus, and incompetent with investigation or taking issues seriously. \r\n\r\nMy advice to you as an long time higher education professional, take your talent to the other UW campuses or another institution. Your future self will thank you. If you are starting out your career in higher education, start here and leave after a year as competition for positions are not competitive and rarely based on qualifications.\r\n\r\nCompensation is below average. Think small non-profit level. I think the only good thing is that when the clock hits 5, everybody just leaves as they don't care. \r\n\r\nThis is one of those higher education institution that is very likely to go bankrupt and close within the next 5 years, I've seen the financial numbers."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Dynamic, Fulfilling, and Fun", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Success Coach in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meet with a lot of different students and departments.
