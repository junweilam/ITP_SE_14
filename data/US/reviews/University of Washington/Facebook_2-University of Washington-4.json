You have to fight for opportunities and you won't be rewarded for going above and beyond in your role.\r\n-Mixed messages around work formats - for months we've been told hybrid and remote work was going to be supported, but there's a constant push to get people back on campus with reasons being \"so leadership sees you\" and \"for the camaraderie.\"\r\n-The U District isn't a very safe place, even though the community and UW are working on making it better. We regularly get alerts that there are armed robberies, thefts, and assaults, at all times of the day, and rarely hear about anyone being caught.\r\n-For the last year there has been a lot of talk about DEI, but it's a very white workplace and it isn't clear what they are doing to make it more welcoming to non-white staff and faculty.\r\n-Lack of communication across units/schools within UW - no one ever seems to know what anyone else is doing. Part of this is because it's a very siloed environment, but everyone knows that and just accepts it instead of trying to figure out how to make improvements."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Accommodating!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Access Assistant in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "very accommodating & very fulfilling", "cons": "a lot of experience needed"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Marketing and Communications Coordinator in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "many opportunities offered to grow", "cons": "low overall pay and compensation"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff are wonderful to work with.", "cons": "Can be stuck in the pre-covid era mindset."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Lifeguarding", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Lifeguard in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible and good co workers on team", "cons": "There were some rude people to deal with"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Colleagues are great, but it's tough to grow", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 May 2022", "job_title": "Advancement Services Officer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing colleagues and resources, a beautiful campus", "cons": "Every system here is archaic.
