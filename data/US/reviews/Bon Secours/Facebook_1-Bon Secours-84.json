It's a close knit environment so you really feel like you are part of team (albeit a strict one)\n\nThere is a lot of practical experience to be gained working there as an engineer. You will oversee everything: from design, to production, to final delivery of products.", "cons": "As an engineer you feel more like an hourly wage worker than a white collar professional. Good luck working from home without a good excuse like having COVID-19. In a world where white collar is becoming more associated with hybrid scheduling, this place feels a bit stuck in a bygone era. \n\nLeadership is almost non existent. These people are looking for a boy scout that will jump around constantly looking for stuff to do. Assignments are given to you over a 5 minute convo with zero presentation. Just a \"hey I need this ....\" \n\nIf you like that kind of way of doing things you'll fit right in, but don't expect to be given timelines or schedules for deliverables. You'll only be notified of such things when it's already too late. Talk to your Production Controller if you want any kind of big picture for the job. As far as career growth this is definitely a good place to get hands on experience, but not stay long term, in my opinion. There is just not good work life balance. The senior engineers are constantly swamped. They consistently show up around 7:30 (or earlier) and stay past 6:00pm (or later). Presumably they like their jobs but if I'm going to be sacrificing that much of my personal time, I better be getting paid well; and this is the type of place where you have to show that level of dedication before you are paid anywhere near an appropriate level."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "PRN Tech", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Rehab Technician in Chesapeake, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "make your own work schedule; your time off does not need to be approved", "cons": "My not get many hours due to not being a full time or part time employee"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Cs tech", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Central Sterile Processing Technician in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management is easy to get along with", "cons": "Insurance sucks and pay could be better"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "It\u2019s okay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Certified Pharmacy Technician in Richmond, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits part time, flexible with school hours", "cons": "Rude coworkers who get away with it if they have been there long"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "worst job", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Medical Secretary in Goshen, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the job wasn't hard it was good,it depends on what you do easy to do front desk as long as you have good help", "cons": "the manager really doesn't care about her employees, the supervisor micromanage you like you are a kid or don't know what you are doing than when you do need help you don't get instead you get snapped at talked about behind your back and made a fool of unstable plan nurses are nasty towards you and the doctor's all of them embarrass you in front of patient's and your peer's that's not cool the training suck because there wasn't any"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Medical Assistant in Suffern, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "8 hours shift Mon-Friday , no weekends.", "cons": "No overtime, bad working environment.
