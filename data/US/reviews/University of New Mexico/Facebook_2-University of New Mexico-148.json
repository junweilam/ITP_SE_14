Budget cuts depending on state revenue or grants. Be prepared to work hard, but learn a lot. I think this is a good job for entry-level employees to learn the pros and cons on their own.

This will and does impact your salary, getting your paycheck in a timely fashion, your health care benefits, and access to grants or funding. On several occasions, they \"lost\" my entire file, lost my contract, lost my benefits, and lost my funding paperwork, leaving me scrambling or without pay for months while they sorted it out. I learned to keep my own copies of paperwork and obsessively check, which makes productivity effectively nill, since not being paid for months is a bit preoccupying.\r\n\r\nSome of the faculty and management are not just indifferent to the welfare of students, junior faculty, and employees, they're downright malicious. In the thirteen years I spent at UNM as first student and then employee, I repeatedly witnessed bullying behavior enacted by tenured faculty and management against junior faculty, students, and employees. HR did precisely nothing about it, and on occasion actually censured anyone who dared to file. The net result in some departments is an atmosphere of fear, distrust, and a breakdown of anything resembling collegiality, in which the tenured faculty and management with issues were given fairly free rein to behave in any way they saw fit by the inattention, disinterest, and inability of HR to intervene. I witnessed a considerable amount of talent be driven away by entrenched faculty and management.\r\n\r\nThe facilities themselves (the physical buildings and equipment) are often antiquated and in poor repair, with plumbing dripping from ceilings in the bathrooms of some buildings, sometimes for years without much repair work being done. The campus itself is poorly lit, and once you leave the newer math, science, and engineering facilities on the south part of campus, you rapidly run into dysfunctional elevators, bathrooms, and a myriad of structural issues and vandalized lights/police call boxes. The campus badly needs broad repair work, and while it's nice that the math, science, and engineering facilities were improved, the rest of the campus really needs some love.\r\n\r\nWhile I worked at UNM, I also witnessed very little interest in working with students, employees, or faculty with disabilities. Some buildings on campus are extremely difficult for disabled students to access, and as a rule, very few people in administration or management cared whether or not disabled students had ADA mandated access to facilities.\r\n\r\nFinally, work-life balance was awful. It was not uncommon for me to end working double my contractual hours due to rampant disrespect of contractual restraints, often while being told that if I wanted to be taken seriously as a scholar, student, or employee, I would work for free on various projects."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Excellent stepping stone opportunity, short term", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Aug 2011", "job_title": "Graduate Assistant in Albuquerque, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Autonomy in course design and planning.
