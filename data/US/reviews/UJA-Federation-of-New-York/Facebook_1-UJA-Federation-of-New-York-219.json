The last con is how events aren't fairly distributed between staff- there are some who work almost every event and others who work none.

Lately, the organization has been hiring lots of talented, professional, and sometimes overqualified staff, many from Ivy League schools. This is beneficial for the institutional culture, which is very friendly, collaborative, and mostly easygoing. People coming as low-level fundraisers or commission workers have a near-automatic opportunity to be promoted, as there's a clear hierarchy for that and time spent on the job becomes synonymous with experience. Most employees are very attentive about the 35-hour work week rule, especially union members, so you'll see a lot of people coming in at 9 sharp and dashing out the door at 4:50 pm. The prestige of UJA is hard to over-estimate. I think it's pretty easy to get hired at most other Jewish non-profits with UJA on your resume.", "cons": "First of all, if you are hoping for a high-paying job at UJA just because it seems more corporate than most NPOs, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. The compensation structure here is preposterous, and union meetings can get pretty out of hand. The executives here are making mid-six figure salaries while entry-level staff are barely making a minimum wage for New York City. There's an implicit assumption that new hires have their parents to fall back on financially, as it's next to impossible to get by on $35k per year on your own. \r\n\r\nSecond, UJA suffers from an extremely conservative approach and an overloaded board of directors, plain and simple. This is because UJA basically stands for \"establishment\" in most people's minds. Outreach to young people is poor, and the most effective arm of that seems to be children of major donors. UJA's presence is not exactly \"cool and hip;\" its target demographic is basically old high net-worth Jews, and the annual campaign does well when those donors are making money in the stock market. As others have mentioned, this is not a place where you come in and start making waves and changing things around. Almost all power is consolidated at the top and everyone else is left to essentially follow their job descriptions. \r\n\r\nFinally, like many other Jewish non-profits, there is a HUGE gender gap here. Women outnumber men maybe 7-to-1. Ethnic diversity is very low, as would be expected. Unfortunately, many employees fall into the old stereotypes: clique-y, loud, consumerist, and obsessed with where you can find the best low-calorie salad in the area.
