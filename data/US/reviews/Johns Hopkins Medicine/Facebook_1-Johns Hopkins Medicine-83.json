This was with them allowing for me to have a higher wage than was usual for my position.\r\n\r\nHealth Insurance - One would think that since Hopkins is itself in the healthcare business that they would have excellent benefits. This is not the case, however, since their insurance forces you to use only Johns Hopkins physicians and facilities in order to receive your best in-network benefits. This was a problem because Hopkins does not have the large presence in Montgomery County, MD that it does in Baltimore and so finding specialists, lab facilities, and hospitals that would be in-network was a ongoing issue. \r\n\r\nReputation - Hopkins' reputation across the country and world is very positive and they are known for their ingenuity and talented surgeons and physicians. This is not true for the majority of the DC Metro Area. When patients were told that their cardiologist was being acquired by Johns Hopkins we received mostly negative feedback. The complaints that were the most common were regarding a shift to more impersonal patient interaction (we no longer directly answered the phone and a new answering system/prompt was implemented) and where patients felt like they were rushed in and out of 15 minute appointments with the doctor and only saw him for 5 minutes, with no real face-to-face time as he became concerned with deal with the computer and couldn't look at the patients anymore."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Beware, Diversity is never the Forfront like they would have you believe.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Environmental Service Worker in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good health and dental insure.", "cons": "They do not care for employees.

The Epic transition was a nightmare and numerous reporting capabilities were just lost, but when I reached out to people to mitigate this I got no responses from them. No one knew what to do or who to contact.\r\n\r\nMy actual job was a nightmare. They really tried to combine two positions into one very low-paying job and it just didn't work.

I have witnessed more than one employee be unjustly terminated from their position, and it was horrible to witness. \n2) Human Resources could care less about employees.

Our concerns and requests always fall upon deaf ears. \n3) Terrible management/leadership and employees are permitted to remain employed, even if they don't produce good work or even care about their jobs.
