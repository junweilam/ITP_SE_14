The only saving grace were the patients and trying to provide the best care possible even when I had had no lunch break or requests for relief were ignored. No praise ever given for a job well done or for staying extra hours when staff was short due to poor planning. So called managers always had their breaks and left on time or took off for personal reasons. Whereas, if RN's or staff had urgent personal requests, we were eyed like we were lying. It was ridiculous to have grown adult professionals treated with such disrespect. Several  of the more experienced RN\"s and staff were accused falsely of not doing their jobs and either left due to the bullying and pressure or were fired. One day they were there, the next day gone. The fact that a few dishonest managers have so much power and can  get away with such illegal, inappropriate treatment of RN's and staff is shocking. From the outside the hospital and it's ads are very convincing that it is a safe,desirable place to go but the constant back biting and fears of losing jobs behind the scenes is dangerous because it is distracting to staff trying to actually do their jobs.
