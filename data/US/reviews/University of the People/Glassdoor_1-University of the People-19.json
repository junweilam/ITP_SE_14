Claims tuition is free when in fact students pay fees for non-existent \"tests\" thus in effect tuition is not free; claims that faculty are volunteers when in fact they are being compensated but below US minimum wage, uses \"volunteerism\" as a ploy to be able to pay faculty below minimum wage without facing legal repercussions. Faculty are treated as glorified serfs with barely any rights. Claims to be accredited when in fact its accreditation is not by a regional or national accreditation agency in US but by a historically long distance education accreditation agency or DEAC which does not assess such traditional university values as academic excellence, meritocracy, democratic governance, academic freedom, quality of curricular content, quality of teaching or research and is thus almost meaningless if not anti-academic. Claims to be an American university when in fact according to a now deleted Wikipedia article its corporate headquarters are/were in Israel. Faculty \"teach\" in the isolation of a virtual platform without a department or colleagues to discuss issues with due to lack of academic departmentalization and a highly authoritarian managerial class of non-academics who rule by fiat from above. Faculty end up \"facilitating\" recycled course packages whose content is often misguided due to lack of faculty input. The managerial minions who opportunistically put such courses together on the basis of freely available online resources seem to abide by the principle that one should judge a book solely by its cover hence the plethora of relevant sounding readings and videos in the prepackaged syllabi many of which upon closer examination make no sense, are irrelevant or just downright inaccurate.   Managers do not tolerate any type of constructive suggestions for improvement made by faculty. If you are an aspiring faculty member, use this institution as a mere career stepping stone at best but get out as soon as possible; don't expect to be rewarded for your hard work or be appreciated due to your good teaching, research, or glowing student evaluations that you received from your students. Key phrases that apply to this online \"university\" are lack of truth in advertising, disrespecting faculty, authoritarian management and an altogether academically hostile climate."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not worth the effort", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 May 2023", "job_title": "Adjunct Instructor in Cal-Ida, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diversity.

Grow a thick skin and do your best to encourage learners to do the right thing by making them see the benefits of not cheating. \r\n\r\nThe student-teacher ratio is exceedingly high. I've never had any course with less than 40 names on the roster! About 50% of the people drop out halfway into the course, but it is still an enormous workload for practically no money. \r\n\r\nThe current pay rate is $425 per 9-week course for US-based instructors, but we don't get paid until week 12. That's a little over $100/month per course taught. The internet bill is higher than that.\r\n\r\nStudents bombard you with questions, which is what they are supposed to do. Their level of excitement is contagious. I cherish every question. The problem is that when you have so many students/questions/complaints (+ the grading) and you must also juggle your paying jobs and your personal life, it can be hard. It truly breaks my heart because I want to help those learners but the reality is that there aren't enough hours in the day when one must work elsewhere to make ends meet. US instructors are graduates from regionally-accredited schools, and most of us have student loans to pay off. The pressure that we have to put a roof over our heads, food on the table, clothes on our children's backs, and pay back the Federal Gvmt is much too great. Inevitably, the amount of free time to volunteer for a worthwhile cause is in short supply and the quality of teaching suffers as a result.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the disadvantages outlined here, this is still very good experience and I would not want this to discourage any future volunteers. At the end of the day, you are serving a greater cause: to educate the less privileged. Just be sure what you are getting into beforehand and don't take any more courses than what you can comfortably handle in your spare time.
