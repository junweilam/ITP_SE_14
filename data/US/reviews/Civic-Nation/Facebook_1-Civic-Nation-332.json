Senior staff has tunnel vision that neglects the needs of their subordinates and only focuses on the mission, which over time times causes toxic workplace behavior at all levels. If you\u2019re already pretty senior in your profession and/or have Obama connections, there may be value here for you at this organization. If you\u2019re a young professional looking and hoping to grow and be given trust/valuable experience in an important space, I would look elsewhere. \r\n\r\nAlso, for a progressive organization, they operate like it\u2019s 2012 and they\u2019re still in the Obama WH.
