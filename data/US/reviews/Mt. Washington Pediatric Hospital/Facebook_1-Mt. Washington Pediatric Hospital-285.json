Washington Pediatric Hospital pays its employees poorly compared to other facilities, to say the least.

Also ratios are difficult and busy, unsafe at times. Currently as of 8/21 there are no permanent managers for either inpatient unit, as one stepped down and the other left to seek better employment.
