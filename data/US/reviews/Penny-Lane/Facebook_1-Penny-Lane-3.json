The semi-regular bonuses that my department received did nothing but boost me to a level that brought me in line with what I should've been making with my experience and skill set. Received my annual COL raise 6 months late, and it was presented to me as a favor and as a reward for a job well done, when it was less than $1 an hour. Other members of my team with less experience/less knowledge were making significantly more simply because they were the bosses favorites. On a regular basis, I was expected to work overtime without additional pay, and often times was paid when I was not in the office (sick), and that was used as the reason for me working on a Saturday without pay.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, Penny Lane was one of the most unprofessional businesses I have ever worked at. There were 9 staff in my new hire training course when I started, and within 3 months, myself and 1 other remained. Now there are none of us, and this is a fairly regular occurrence. Every two weeks, at least 4-6 new employees were on-boarded, and 3-4 left the company. Knowledge and work ethic mean nothing - they look for people to fill seats. When when given ample proof of the inability for staff to complete the job they were hired for, no write ups occur and there is 0 repercussions for not knowing how to do your job."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Stay far, far away!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Outpatient Therapist in Lancaster, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Location stipend (at Antelope Valley location only)\r\n-Individual office (at the Lancaster location with the exception of the MAT assessors)\r\n-friendly/supportive coworkers\r\n-A few supervisors are willing to put the needs of clients ahead of revenue when needed\r\n-EBP trainings are available (although the company began to limit trainings during my tenure)", "cons": "The Cons outweigh the Pros by a wide margin. There are several aspects of the agency that work really well (mostly at the corporate office) however, the Antelope Valley location seems to operate on a different planet as the rest of the agency. Most agencies have billing requirements and provide encouragement for staff to meet expectations. This agency is punitive and employs expectations that are not possible to meet (i.e. upon starting, a new-hire receives 2 large binders filled with information, must read through over 30 regulations that could lead to the equivalent of a write-up). It appears that Client care doesn't even get the backseat (the trunk is probably most accurate) where a therapist will be expected to constantly shift clients' billing plan (which creates additional paperwork) even if the client does not meet the criteria. The morale is pretty low; In the 6 months I was there, I noticed at least 7 therapists get hired and either resign or transfer to a different location. If you happen to be looking for opportunities to advance your career, the Lancaster location is not the place. In interviews, I was told there were \"plenty\" of opportunities for advancement however, after being hired and discussing this with my supervisor, I was informed that it was not likely that a promotion would happen within a year and highly unlikely to become a clinical supervisor (even if you meet qualifications). Lastly (and probably most importantly), upper-management (including clinical supervisors) have \"favorites.\" If you happen to be a favorite, the job seems to be less intense. If you do not happen to be a favorite (or fit into what the identify as a \"family\" environment), upper management applies an exorbitant amount pressure and become quick to create a paper trail that could eventually lead to being fired. Overall, there are no real benefits to working for the company. As previously mentioned, the cons significantly outweigh the pros. Even if you are just out of school, it would be more worth your time to find an agency (or practice) that practice good values and set realistic expectations (there are definitely a few out there!)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "In support of the support staff", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They had nice parties for the staff", "cons": "They do not recognize the achievements of non degree staff, have a tendency to condescend to non degree staff and pay them way less than a living wage."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Teaching at Penny Lane", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Preschool Teacher in Chicago Ridge, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a lot of trainings provided and everything is done by standards.
