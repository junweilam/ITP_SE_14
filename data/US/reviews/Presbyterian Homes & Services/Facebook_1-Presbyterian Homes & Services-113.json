You\u2019re stuck doing all the work. Supervisors don\u2019t care to fix things when you complain. Using trays to clean tables rather than carts so it takes longer and hurts you back. Pay sucks. People who have more seniority can berate you, or sexually harass you, and not get into trouble. Coworkers gossip which feels like you\u2019re back in high school. Point system is unfair. Both supervisors and employees should both be held accountable if they don\u2019t do what they\u2019re suppose to. Some residents play games who have a huge stick up their butt when trying to do your job. Stand up not needed because it takes up valuable time to get things set up before you serve.

An example of one of the practices is to accompany guests to their destination whenever possible instead of simply pointing out directions.  Another pro, I think,  would be the number of sites in the area, and how easy it is to transfer to a different location if you are moving or find a more appealing position within the company.

A lot of corporate rules and standards that trickle down through various levels of management are often unrealistic in practice, and if you question these standards, or propose an idea to your direct supervisor you think might work better in a particular situation, you'll most likely never hear back.  The high-ups are very, very distant from the front line workers like myself, a nursing assistant.  They tend to go by industry standards for a lot of things such as the amount of staff per residents, and this is not always realistic once you factor in other things like how the nursing assistants at Pres Homes are expected to not only perform nursing assistant-specific duties, but also dietary, housekeeping, laundry, therapy programs, simple treatments, etc, and also they lavish, spacious layout of some facilities (all private rooms split into separate neighborhoods) gives one nursing assistant 3 times the square footage to cover compared to the traditional nursing homes that the \"industry standards\" are based off of.  The pay is below average, lower than MOST of the similar companies, due to the fact that the facilities themselves is where Pres puts the bulk of its money, not towards its employees.  The employees are expected to complete much more than they can realistically accomplish within their shift, they're CONSTANTLY short staffed (at least 3 days a week my shift is short 1 or 2 CNA's), you're persecuted if you clock out a minute late because you hadn't finished all of the extra work, the benefits are lackluster at best, your supervisors don't acknowledge your accomplishments because they're constantly stressed as well, and there has been a high turn over rate ever since I started 3 years ago.  And expect a phone call most of your days off from your scheduler asking if you'll pick up a shift, without a call-in bonus, and don't expect overtime, EVER.  People start working for Pres, see how stressful it is every day, and leave.  Happens every month.   Ive ben doing this type of work for 7 years and have worked for a few different companies in that time, none as all-around frustrating as Pres Homes.

Although my supervisory staff were mostly competent and good, they were powerless against the corporate office to make common sense decisions on broken policies. There is a corporate office that hands-down decisions that often don't seem to have relevance to the needs of the residents and direct care staff. Decisions are based on money more than providing a positive care experience, and the care staff are expected to pick up the slack, or else! Some policies seem to only have the purpose of punishing staff. They don't make money or increase service to residents. Staff are given residents with acute and constant needs, but aren't provided the time to meet these needs correctly. I have never worked for a company that has made decisions on staffing in such an irresponsible manner. Residents don't get routine cares. When it does become a problem it is always the fault of care staff. Even when it is obvious the real reason is a lack of allotted hours on the schedule. Even when simple care ratios show that there is no way you could complete their care plans on time. Pay is comparable to similar companies. Benefits are terrible. They don't pay much if at all on medical insurance, but you get their group policy. Honestly for just a few dollars more a month you could pick up your own policy, which may have slightly better coverage. Management is full of lip service and have no accountability. This trickles down until it lands on the shoulders of direct care staff who have to \"fix\" or \"deal\" with the resulting issues to get their jobs done, on top of their actual their duties. It is irritating how a non-profit will make decisions based on a bottom line instead of quality of care."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Nonexistent Management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Server in Plymouth, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good experience, got to interact with some very nice residents, good starting pay", "cons": "The supervisors (We went through 3 supervisors in 3 months) were never around on weekends, which were the only times I worked due to being a high school student.
