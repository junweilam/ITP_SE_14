Getting to know familiar faces and saying hello in the hallways always improves my day. Many of my colleagues have become friends. We find special ways to celebrate birthdays, births, holidays, and even formed a knitting club(!).\r\n\r\nMeaningful work - best of all, the work we do here truly matters.

I know them well and work with them on a daily basis. They are\r\nbailing water from a leaking ship, never knowing where the axe is going\r\nto land next. Kripalu is a nightmare and I mean it when I say, run don\u2019t\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be bullied, if you want to be verbally abused, work here.\r\nIf you want to see your friends and colleagues harassed, work here. If\r\nyou want to see guests, faculty, and donors walking away in disgust\r\nthen this is the place for you!!! \r\n\r\nAccept a job here and you can\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned. Let the Glassdoor reviews / ratings, and the CEO\u2019s rating help you turn your back on this very depressing workplace. Kripalu is sinking and no one is more aware than those who work here. This CEO and her \u201cteam\u201d abuse, intimidate and malign the staff and now they are turning on each other. In addition, we have an HR\r\ndepartment that has fallen down on the job. But on the positive side \u2013\r\nwe, as a staff are united, we are angry, we are documenting and above\r\nall, we are talking!\r\n\r\nKripalu can place a positive review first in the Glassdoor line-up but\r\npeople read further. HR writes that they \u201cwelcome a deeper\r\nconversation.\u201d Hmmm, how interesting \u2013 since confidential\r\nconversations are immediately taken to the CEO (Yes, we have proof).\r\nBetrayal is commonplace (Yes, we have proof). Invasion of privacy is\r\nrampant (Yes, we have proof). \u201cA deeper conversation?\u201d Perhaps\r\nKripalu should be much less obvious."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sad Place to Work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 May 2018", "job_title": "Administrative in Stockbridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Employee Assistance Package with price cuts on different insurance\r\n-No smoking on grounds", "cons": "-Since it's a non-profit, I thought working here would allow me to be part of something bigger and make real positive change in the world. Apart from my own disappointing employment experience, I'm also disappointed in how much the org keeps moving away from mission-based programming and actions. \r\nOpportunities seem to go to the few favorites on staff, or external hires. Veteran staff who are good at their job aren't rewarded, mentored, or considered for advancement opportunities. I keep hoping that things will change, but they don't. I feel cheated and this has been the most dis-empowering work experience in over 20 years of full-time employment. Truly saddening as this is meant to be a place for empowerment. A beacon even. The saddest part is that I don't see the underserved or marginalized being supported as a focus, but I do see more catering to the wealthy. \r\nPaid time off is scant and tricky. This is not aligned with the ideals of wellness that are integral to the mission and vision of a wellness retreat center. This is not a progressive employer. There is a very limited maternity leave and surprisingly no childcare option. \r\n-No matching 401(K) \r\n-While responsibilities increase and expectations become more demanding, compensation remains the same.\r\n-Culture and values sound great in theory, but they're not part of the employee experience."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Kripalu is Falling Apart", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "13 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Administrative in Stockbridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Natural setting with beautiful grounds.", "cons": "There is such systemic sadness in this building throughout all levels of the administration. While interviewing I asked about the Glassdoor and Indeed reviews that were so negative - and have now only gotten worse. Being on the inside I will honestly say, what is being reported is absolutely true and unexaggerated. Senior Leadership makes the excuse that only people who are dissatisfied  go to Glassdoor to write their \"complaints.\" That was their answer!  Nothing about taking the reviews seriously or trying to make positive change. At this point, they are having a difficult time getting people to accept positions because the reviews are honest and compelling. No one wants to step into an organization with reviews like this. \r\n\r\nFrom my perspective,  Senior Leadership, as a body of decision-makers, are puppets who bully at the request of the CEO and EVP.  Many are not suitable hires themselves, so they too are worried that they will be next.  This is perhaps the most vulnerable mess at Kripalu.  They know the secrets of the CEO and they  understand how she operates. They also understand that the Trustees are weak and therefore, no one will step in to rally for Kripalu's well-being and fiscal safety.  With so many holes, it is no wonder that Kripalu is truly failing in every direction.  \r\n\r\nAs with all places that guide and teach - if you have a fractured administration, you then have fractured faculty and classrooms.  The  guests , faculty and presenters ask me constantly, \"What is happening?\" Many are disconnecting from Kripalu and going elsewhere.  I supposed it was only a matter of time. \r\n\r\nMy advice if you are considering a job here is to walk away. You might think you can avoid being hit, but you can't. This is a \"top down\" bleed. If the CEO and EVP remain in place it will only get worse, and we already see what has happened oh-so-quickly.  \r\n\r\nThe Heart of Kripalu no longer exists.  It is a dark and dreary place indeed."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "A Company That  Cares", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Assistant Guest Services Manager in Pittsfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefit from classes, healthy diet, beautiful grounds.
