I have seen deserving, more experienced people get passed up for promotions because of this practice. #2 Culture - this is something they brag about, but don't live day to day. The culture is great for frontline workers, but not directors and above. Some don't know how to lead, are not experienced in running this business, and have friends in high places to get to their positions. #3 Pay - pay is below market. In the past years, they've tried to keep up with rapid inflation, but it is not enough. #4 No room for advancement - people here either have worked for 30+ years to get promoted, or are replaced by young, inexperienced people. #5 Always short staffed - good if you like to get extra shifts, but bad if you're salaried and are expected to work 60 hour weeks. So short-staffed that no one else but you will pick up the slack. #6 Bad managers - they keep bad managers solely because they have been there forever, or are Adventists. These managers take credit for all your work and overwork you. Ask for help and they won't do anything because there's no budget for additional help. These managers aren't fired. In fact, they even try to promote them within the AdventHealth network of hospitals. Instead of releasing dead weight, they'd rather that person be someone else's problem. #7 Favoritism - rampant.
