I am a former employee who was laid off within the last 3 months. I would never write a review to undermine anyone else's experience (recent 1 star reviews) but I did want to provide a different perspective. I have worked in ministry for over 20 years and I can say unequivocally that IJM is in the top 1% of employers to work for. Actually, from my perspective, I think that is the reason for the recent negative reviews is because IJM has never faced transitions like most ministries have. And when you are in the top 1% of employers, and go through a transition, it can be a bit jarring. But I can tell you that even through these transitions, in my opinion, IJM is still in the top 1-2% of employers to work for, ESPECIALLY as it relates to ministry. I have seen over and over and over again discrimination of women in ministry, (prior to my work at IJM), it is rampant. When I started at IJM, I had my breath taken away when I saw how they uphold the dignity of each individual--where men and women are considered equal and have the exact same opportunities professionally. \r\nIn over 22 years of ministry work, I have been laid off twice. During the first layoff in 2008, I had a 30 second meeting, was given a slip of paper and in 90 seconds had my laptop and phone retrieved and was ushered out. No severance, nothing. I had to call my family from the land line at work to tell them I had gotten laid off and that my number was no longer good. That is what you get with many ministries. They did what was required, nothing more. I like to size up someone as far as their character based on three things 1) Proven character- show me what you have done over a long period of time 2) Above and Beyond character- show me how you have exceeded what was required 3) Hidden character (in a good way)-show me something you have done consistently, going and above and beyond, that you haven\u2019t told anyone about, i.e. \u201cdon\u2019t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.\u201d Matthew 6:3. An example of this would be someone who has tithed for 20 years, but instead of giving 10% they have given 30%, and they have never told anyone about it. The example doesn\u2019t have to be financial, it can be relational etc., but to me these three things are a mark of deep, deep integrity. With IJM, their kindness to me through the layoff mirrored the character of Christ in its utter and complete generosity. So much so, I had my breath taken away yet again, especially given my prior experience. Why would IJM do something like that for someone, when it is not required, when it is above and beyond and most importantly, when no one would find out about it. I\u2019ll tell you why, because the character of IJM is marked by utter generosity, not only financially but in prayer, in preferring others and in service to the Lord. It is this generosity that made their treatment of me a given. I just wanted to share this with you, who are thinking about employment at IJM. I could not recommend it more highly.", "cons": "The system is asking me for cons. I can't think of any.

As a result projects and change are poorly managed, lacking some very basic standard operating procedures, resulting in even more stress. IJM moves so quickly that it virtually never pauses to reflect, analyze, and learn. Lessons are not absorbed into the organization's knowledge & culture. \r\n\r\nIJM seems fairly typical of DC culture - the expectation to be straight-laced and type-A. Add to that the slightly conservative bent of it being a christian organization and the requirements to dress in business formal clothing every day, the result is a suffocating company culture. Only work here if this sounds attractive to you. \r\n\r\nIJM has grown very rapidly in recent years. As a result, their back-office operations have had tremendous growing pains, causing very high leadership turnover and chronically unfilled positions. Things feel constantly in-flux at IJM which takes its toll on everyone. If you interview at IJM, specifically in business or people operations,  demand honest answers about leadership and management turnover before accepting an offer. \r\n\r\nIJM has approached a lot of these problems by just hiring more staff, hoping that more employees will plug the gaps in missing or inconsistent back-office processes. Unfortunately, this not only makes back-office processes more disjointed; it also means that a staff's job description is only accurate for the duration of the quick-fix project they were hired to work on, if ever. As a result, there is no clear career path for most staff. \r\n\r\nEven though IJM does commit a great deal of resources towards spiritual formation, quarterly retreats, daily prayer and sincerely pursues spiritual well-being in its work, I find that too often this results in dismissing pressing business operations problems with a \"Just turn it over to the Lord,\" attitude, or outright hostility at being told where things need to improve.  Comments on how to improve things disappear into the leadership void. \r\n\r\nIt pains me to say, because the mission of IJM is so important, but my overall experience with IJM was very negative."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Riding on successes of the past; Leadership lost its humility", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "26 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The mission is one that deserves attention but org isn't transparent in how it uses funds for its work in educating and mobilizing others", "cons": "Leadership says people matter but their actions don't reflect their words.

However, that does not excuse the lack of diversity and the warped perspective within the organization. There is a bit of irony when an organization that claims to be a bold advocate of human rights, globally, specifically combating issues like police abuse of power, plays it safe, in a somewhat cautious way on these same issues in the North America context. IJM's work overseas is measurable and impactful. Teams are driven, and though growth within the organization can be difficult, its a good place to work.
