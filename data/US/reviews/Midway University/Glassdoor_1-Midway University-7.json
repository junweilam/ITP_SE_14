The title is a joke, though, because no one has a staff. If you are unfortunate enough to be one of the few non-director employees, you will have an unbelievable workload.\r\n\r\nThe management is completely top-down. Do not even dream of making a suggestion. My Director will not let me speak to anyone but her to make sure that I don't try to handle anything myself.\r\n\r\nThere is very little true support for the mission of the university. A lot of lip service is paid to the importance of teaching, but teachers are hired hours before classes begin (and sometime after they begin). There is no training for them. Each 'department' consists of one or two full time faculty and an armada of ever-changing adjuncts. The school simply doesn't have the critical mass of faculty to survive long term. Don't think getting hired is a complement. If you applied and you are breathing, you'll get hired.\r\n\r\nThe highest level administration has their ideas about what need to be done and they are completely isolated from the realities of the day to day work, so those ideas are completely irrelevant, but they won't hear any other ideas.\r\n\r\nDespite a very top heavy structure, tThe university continues to suffer from lack of leadership that truly understands or is willing to act on the issues. The university continues to suffer from a serious identity crisis--failing to recognize its own strengths (online learning) and weaknesses (lack of skilled employees). Good employees don't last long in this environment. Most employees at Midway have been there less than 2 years (many less than 6 months)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Faculty in Purgatory", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 May 2018", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Midway, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoyed the employees and the beautiful landscape.", "cons": "Communication, authoritarian leadership, and high turnover are the most serious issues."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It seemed so good at first...", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Midway, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great scenery, nice people, good students, beautiful campus.
