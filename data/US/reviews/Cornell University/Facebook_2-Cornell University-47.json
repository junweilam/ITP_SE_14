A very chaotic and stressful environment where even doing your best isn't good enough. Top leadership is destroying the ivy league reputation of the university by using deceitful and poor business and marketing practices that potential students would only equate with a lesser caliber school. Instead of upper management accepting failure of their poor strategies, middle management is posed to create an intimidating and unproductive environment in an attempt to \"grow numbers\". Recently after becoming endowed employees of the university itself, many employees who were misclassified under the FLSA are now taking yet another financial hit by being paid less monthly due a pay restructuring. At no time has anyone taken responsibility for the incredible amounts of overtime that was worked by misclassified employees in an attempt to keep up with changing demands - where back pay is legally due. However, we have now had our workload increased significantly to try to meet absurd goals that are unobtainable even under the best of conditions. Because of this, many employees are forced to work off the clock and through breaks to avoid general upset from management as your \"numbers\" are put under a magnifying glass for the entire organization to see. While management strictly enforces the rules of \"no overtime\" it is impossible to complete work as assigned under the constant stress, distractions, changing strategies and leadership who uses fear and intimidation due to an inability and clear lack of experience. In an attempt to avoid backlash, employees simply do not voice their concerns or record their time accurately as they are afraid they will be terminated or retaliated against. If you like constant criticism, belittling and threats of intimidation all while being placed under a microscope having all daily activities monitored, examined and exploited to the 10th degree this is your place to work.
