Here are a few cons that some individuals may experience while working at Cornell: High Cost of Living: Cornell University is located in Ithaca, New York, which has a relatively high cost of living compared to other areas. Housing, transportation, and everyday expenses can be expensive, which may impact your overall financial situation. Workload and Stress: Like many academic institutions, Cornell University is known for its rigorous academic environment and high expectations. Depending on your role and department, you may experience heavy workloads, tight deadlines, and demanding responsibilities. This can lead to increased stress levels and work-life imbalance. Limited Career Advancement Opportunities: Due to the university's large size and competitive nature, career advancement opportunities may be limited in certain fields or departments. Advancing to higher positions or securing tenure can be highly competitive and require significant effort and dedication. Harsh Winters: Ithaca experiences cold and snowy winters, which can be challenging for some individuals, particularly if they are not accustomed to such weather conditions. Winter storms and icy conditions may affect commuting and outdoor activities. Limited Diversity in Surrounding Area: While Cornell University promotes diversity and inclusivity, the surrounding area may have limited diversity compared to larger metropolitan areas. This can impact social and cultural experiences for individuals seeking a more diverse community. Funding Challenges: Like many educational institutions, funding for research and projects can be competitive and limited. Securing external grants or funding may require significant time and effort, which can be a challenge for researchers and faculty members. Limited Networking Opportunities Outside the University: While Cornell University provides a robust network within the academic community, building connections outside the university or in industries unrelated to academia may require additional effort. The university's focus on research and academia may limit exposure to other professional networks. It's important to note that these cons may vary depending on individual circumstances, roles, and departments within Cornell University. It's advisable to thoroughly research and consider these factors when making decisions about employment at the university."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Decent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Ithaca, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is alright here", "cons": "They don't really care about their employees"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "GRA in Cornell", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Ithaca, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Big university, better pay as PhD students", "cons": "rural area, lots of job changes"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Very liberal and supportive environment.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "30 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Senior Research Associate in Ithaca, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It's very easy to collaborate with people here.

However, there are numerous cons I have encountered during my time teaching with Cornell; I will mention a few of the most significant here.  \r\n\r\nTo begin with, for most teaching positions, there is neither any training nor any supervision (and evaluation from others who already have teaching experience).  As a result, graduate instructors have to figure out how to teach on their own without any feedback outside of the students' own evaluations at the end of each semester.  This leads to unnecessary challenges for both the TA instructors and the students, and hinders both teaching abilities and opportunities for professional development.\r\n\r\nAnother significant flaw is that graduate TA instructors are told that their TA work should only take at most 15 hours a week, and therefore their work as students is apportioned accordingly to fill the rest of their schedule (3-5 classes) and they are paid at a comparable part-time rate.  However, the actual responsibilities required for the job tend to take significantly more time than that, sometimes reaching 50 hours a week, while graduate instructors' responsibilities for the courses they're taking can often require a similarly high number of hours.  As a result, most TA's struggle to actually fulfill both their teaching and own coursework responsibilities.  As a result, both undergrad students and graduate teachers again suffer from the stressful and ineffective structure for organizing teaching responsibilities.\r\n\r\nAs this job is intentionally deeply integrated into the learning process for graduate students at Cornell, it would seem much more appropriate if it were structured so as to actually allow the graduate students to learn how to teach well AND to not totally overwhelm their ability to both teach and do their coursework.\r\n\r\nAnd that's before getting into the unhealthy and unprofessional politics of the department.  These politics severely affect graduate students' work as both students and teachers, and are a big part of the job..."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good benefits, not interested in learning from best practices.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Oct 2017", "job_title": "General in Ithaca, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good health and retirement benefits, very pretty campus, students are top notch.
