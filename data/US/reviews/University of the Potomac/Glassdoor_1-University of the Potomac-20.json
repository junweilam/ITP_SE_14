Frequently there is no soap or toilet paper in the restrooms. There is no security or safety for that matter as I have come to work and found homeless people in the lobby.  I once watched as a student was accosted and harassed by a man wearing a plastic bag.  This school doesn\u2019t even provide instructors with textbooks.  They ask instructors to get gratis instructor manuals from the publishers because they don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t afford to pay for books.  This of course means that instructors have to improvise (or break copyright laws) for the first couple or few weeks of class because books often arrive late. Classes are only seven weeks long and students are told to order their books online (not in advance) which means they are in class for two to three weeks with no textbook and sometimes longer. One student said, \u201cWhy do I have to have a book when the teacher doesn\u2019t have one?\u201d \r\nYou can expect your pay to be short repeatedly. The electricity was even turned off for nonpayment during teaching hours.  They don\u2019t have in-service meetings because they don\u2019t want to pay teachers for their time and the dean has said he\u2019s never had to pay teachers to come to meetings on their day off.  He prefers to bark through emails because he doesn\u2019t want to hear teachers whine. When they do have a meeting (on your lunch break) it is useless because you sit there listening to the dean talk about his annual checkup because he has benefits & teachers don\u2019t.  I have to wonder how they maintain accreditation because you may teach a class for a term & then get the same students, same book, same syllabus, same lessons, same pages, etc. for the next term and they just change the title of the syllabus.  They don\u2019t even have a system in place to keep track of which students have taken which classes because many of them have been there for years (carried over from BIR).  It\u2019s a Visa mill for people to come live in the U.S. & pretend they\u2019re students."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not Student Friendly", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jan 2019", "job_title": "Director in Washington, DC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Competitive Salary.
