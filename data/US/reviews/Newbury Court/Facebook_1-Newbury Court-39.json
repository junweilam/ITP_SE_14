Was told by a certain Team Leader numerous times that serving isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d job. It\u2019s very obvious they look down upon their staff. \n\nLittle opportunity for advancement.

I have been physically assaulted by a resident and received little sympathy from management. I was basically expected to continue working. Another resident told me I look like pornstar Stormy Daniels and to \u201cget some exercise.\u201d He was spoken to by upper management, which angered him, so he decided to yell at me and call me a \u201csnitch\u201d in front of the whole dining room. Team Leader\u2019s only response to him was that \u201cwe have work to do.\u201d Upper management wrote a letter to Food Committee telling them to be nicer to the waitstaff. I literally heard them laughing about it at dinner that evening. These are just a few incidents, but I could name plenty more! \n\nNo bussers or food runners.
