We now have a lens board ( when it works) but the same issues continue to be brought up and not addressed by the management team beyond our unit manager. Our unit manager can only do so much; it is then up to upper management to make decisions that support the unit and supply what is needed whether it be staff, etc. Unfortunately, there also seems to be no regard for employee retention. It appears that the hospital would rather hire in new employees with less experience than to continue to invest in those who have stayed loyal to the company over the years. Sending around an ice cream cart every once in a while is not productive in keeping skilled, experienced, exceptional workers; it generally makes the staff feel devalued and disrespected. There also continues to be a perception that although ICU takes care of the most critical patients in the hospital they need, and deserve, the least assistance in staffing and other areas. There seems to be no consideration of how critically ill these patients are and how much care they require; care that is specialized due to their critical status. The patients and community we serve deserve so much more as well as the staff. I believe that the healing ministry of Christ is more than prayer over the com system. It involves valuing people, meeting them where they are at and lifting them up. This does not seem to extend to the staff as well.
