But contact faculty are treated like lesser beings than their tenure-track colleagues \u2013 spoken to like children, paid far less, and often asked to do high levels of service far beyond job descriptions that mostly involve teaching. It's a recipe for exploitation when you have a two-tiered system like this, with tenured faculty able to grossly misbehave with little consequences and near-total job security, while contract faculty have to say yes to everything so they will be rehired. Note that job titles make it not obvious from the outside who is tenure-track and who is contract \u2013 both are called 'Assistant Professor', 'Associate Professor', and 'Professor' on places like the public-facing faculty guide. This obscures just how many regular, full-time faculty are not tenure-track and being paid less and asked to do more for their work - and often working with little respect from their tenure(-track) colleagues.\r\n\r\nFaculty and staff pay alike is much lower here than at many other Boston area schools, so we are hemorrhaging employees at this point \u2013 especially staff \u2013 who are often not replaced.
