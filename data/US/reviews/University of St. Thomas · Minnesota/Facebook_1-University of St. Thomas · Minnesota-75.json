While in some sense this could be good, the administration has seriously missed some wonderful opportunities for university advancement and are often incapable of really seeing beyond a rather limited world view.\r\n2) My experience, and the accounts of colleagues of mine, have shown that middle management (Directors) can either be strong or poor leaders.  My own director was a poor manager as he had little vision or foresight for leading the division.  Moreover, my director was often disconnected from what was actually going on and the team often had to lead him.  I have heard much worse from others about their directors being simply incompetent but upper management is often afraid to remove them as it may cause trouble.\r\n3) While benefits are strong, St. Thomas, like so many other institutions, are slowly decreasing support for those benefits.  The rates are going up, and my sense is that in the long run the university will not be able to sustain its current model.\r\n\r\nSt. Thomas is at an interesting point in its history.  Student numbers are going down and the university is desperately trying to recruit more students, sometimes at the expense of attracting unqualified students.  In addition, there could potentially be a challenge for the university down the road in that the university has placed a tremendous amount of money in creating state of the art facilities and resources, but is not entirely prepared for the decrease in attendance which will have a tremendous effect on its income.  Finally, its ambitious capitol campaign is struggling to meet its $500m goal and stands currently at just short of $400m."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Creativity Encouraged", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Feb 2014", "job_title": "IT Applications Analyst in Saint Paul, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "As a IT Application Analyst I felt respected by peers and management, and I was free to exercise creativity in finding technical solutions to business problems.

The talks about diversification of people, culture, and curricula are all just for show, and the leadership makes little effort to diversify. Many of the faculty, again predominantly white, middle class, are superficial, petty, jealous, and unprofessional. There is too much emphasis on getting good evaluation from the students. Instead of teaching what is essential for the course, the instructors are pressured to make the students feel good. Good university education must challenge the students to think critically and transform their ways of seeing the world. Sometimes the students may feel the pain of re-examining what they had previously believed and what they had cherished. If the instructors are pressured to get good reviews from students more than anything, all these \"transformative\" teachings become too risky.  \r\n\r\nThe scholarship and teaching of many of the faculty members are outdated.  Check the faculty publications and course pages, most of which are available on the web for anyone to browse. It would not take long for an academic in a similar field to get an idea where the quality of this institution stands. Although there are many \"good\" students, they have not been exposed to cutting-edge scholarship and diverse perspectives as a result. \r\n\r\nThe full-time regular faculty are overly obsessed with distinguishing themselves from adjunct faculty. The full-time faculty often have opposed to including adjunct faculty in various research opportunities. Also, there have been unproductive competition and mutual exclusion among the academic disciplines, where collaboration and interdisciplinary research and teaching should take place. \r\n\r\nThe university pays the same amount per course that I was paid 20 years ago when I started teaching at another private university, yet they think they are generous.
