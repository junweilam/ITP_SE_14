Student Services Leadership and UOPX Executive team make so many directional changes and organizational changes that it causes the employees to get disoriented in the whirlwind. For the past year, Operations has been going through the Service Model Redesign. The changes that they make have caused so much added stress on Academic Counselors and have made students express confusion and frustration. I had many opportunities to work closely with Directors and VPs, but once I was no longer needed, it was as if they never even knew me. I strongly advise anyone considering applying to be an Academic Counselor to hold off for 3-5 years. UOPX Leadership needs to figure out what the Academic Counselor will actually be before they start hiring new employees. We had a new Academic Counselor join our team right as COVID-19 forced us to start working from home. This position has so many complexities to it that it was very difficult for her to be successful in the position. She ended up quitting after 3 months. I worked very closely throughout her onboarding to try to be successful, but this job adds so much unnecessary stress on its employees that it is very difficult to stay sane in it. The only solution that UOPX Leadership has implemented to help us with the stress of the position is to download an app called Ginger. At the end of the day, I have been very disappointed in all levels of UOPX Leadership and do not wish my worst enemy to have to work within this company. And I say company because it is not a university.

Quality work is important to me so I wasn't willing to compromise on that, especially when you are producing higher education courses and training for faculty. The majority of the courses and trainings are at least 80-90 percent good quality, but from a instructional content development and management perspective, there should be more consistency across the University. The reason there isn't more consistency is due to each college and department wanting to direct their own instructional content development. I prefer working with more collaborative teams rather than siloed teams that create inner conflicts with other teams. The working environment is sometimes fast-paced, but inspirational being around educators and students. The main challenge I observed while working there is higher level executives and University decision makers were not often in sync nor understanding the realities of content production. They were constantly striving to keep up with the latest higher education marketing trends rather than trusting the instructional design and development teams to deliver course material that is developed according to sound teaching and learning principles. Also upper management had a tendency to change their minds too often, creating chaos and confusion for people working in content production.

EVERY DAY there is a new metric, or duty, or approach to get people to enroll, and do whatever they can to make students stick around and keep paying for school. This school is no longer the best online school option, and they were never the cheapest. The classes can be moved around at will and the lack of conformity between instructors creates a diminished development experience. \r\n\r\nAnd now I have to explain to prospective students how \"we are accredited, but we have been put on notice wit the Higher Learning Commission\" which means in the future your diploma may be toilet paper. Does Michigan, or ASU, or Duke, or Rutgers have to worry about accreditation? Hell no!\r\n\r\nThe new Get to Work or whatever the stupid catch phrase is rests on new career resources at the main website and student website.

And the pay is 20-30% less than what competitors pay for the same role. As with any big company you have to kiss some serious a$$ to move up or around, but mostly you only make lateral moves and sometimes you have to go back to the bottom of the pay range for a new area. \r\n\r\nI feel like I could burn in hell for enrolling some people I know have no shot of getting through the programs. The open door enrollment policy means anyone can get in and as long as the financial aid keeps coming in to the university they will make sure they stay in school. I just completed my MBA with other students who couldn't write complete sentences or formulate arguments or even speak in front of others.

The school doesn't try to challenge its people and if advisors do obtain advanced degrees, advisors definitely don't have the opportunity to use them for any of the advisor jobs.  The compensation structure is a joke, you can work as hard as possible and achieve the best accolades for your position from students and managers, but none of that matters, you will still get the same increase as everyone else, if you are lucky enough to get an increase.\r\n\r\nThe career advancement is also a joke.  As the company is floundering there are limited positions open around the company, so if you start as an advisor with University of Phoenix, plan on being there for a good long time before getting to move out of that role, or you may have to look outside the company like many others have had to do.  The company doesn't care about keeping its talent, they care about their bottom line, and to them it's more important to pay the lowest possible salary in the industry to their people rather that keep someone with a higher pay who is so much better at working with students.\r\n\r\nThe management team is clueless and powerless, and that combination is not attractive to any employee.  I have had the opportunity to approach management on several occasions about the lack of opportunity, making changes to the compensation structure, and multiple ways to increase productivity and morale within my assigned territory.  Management presents you with a good sounding line and brushes it aside as soon as you leave their office.  Another thing that the management team have become experts at is dangling the carrot, they discuss great opportunities and changes and tell you that it's coming soon, and keep saying that until everyone realizes that those promises were empty and we really won't see anything better any time soon.  Management also has the amazing talent of micromanaging and focusing on the smallest thing, so even if you are doing a great job for the school and students can't say enough good things about you and you've just finished training 3 of their new people to the point where now they are as bored as you, the manager will ask you why your phone was in the wrong login code for a few minutes.  The concept of reality doesn't really fit through the doors here at UOPX, and it shows with the extreme frustration of many of its employees.\r\n\r\nJust to give everyone an idea of what to expect pay wise.  I've worked here for about 3 1/2 years and I am only getting paid about $2500.00 more per year than someone who just started yesterday, and the best part is I get to handle that person's work and train that person to be great at their job because I am the go to person on my team.  The company doesn't provide any incentive to be good at your job and care, but it's amazing that some employees like myself still do care about helping students and team members.\r\n\r\nIf you have a solid work ethic and you already have advanced degrees do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a position.

One can maintain Academic Rigor and receive nasty \"customer reviews\" because many students think they bought a grade higher than the one they did not earn. Then the instructor has to answer a Department Chair inquiry over why a customer was unhappy with his grade. \r\n\r\nThe alternative is to downgrade the difficulty of the class, or grade easier by overlooking errors in student work and assignments submitted late. Then the instructor only faces an academic review from the Chair once a year. A slight slap on the wrist for being an \"Easy A\" is easier to take than frequent customer criticism.\r\n\r\nThis is the root of their diploma mill reputation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this is the first employee stock purchase plan where I lost money on paper.

Faculty are told to report student academic problems, but then students are not reprimanded when they happen; that is unless you consider a warning to be a reprimand.  Over the past 11 years I have reported close to 450 students; of these students I can recall only 2 that were suspended.

This is not an education but rather a medium for a person to pay for a piece of paper that is loosely considered to be a degree.
