The upper management team is always expressing a career progression to new employees, but they hire outside the company for their managers.\r\n\r\n Managers do not show much respect to their employees. I have heard many advisors get talked down too by their managers in front of other employees. It is embarrassing for the employee being \"disciplined\" and the employees that are in ear shot of the conversation.   \r\n\r\nThere is inconsistency and ambiguity as to the direction the company is moving towards. It was told to us in December that the company does not know exactly the business plan for the new year. I have never worked for a company before that did not know their business plan for the next year when the new year was less than a month away. But this lack of visions is also evident on a day-to-day basis.  One day the company encourages advisors to have interactions with potential students with honesty and sincerity, and the next day the company pressures the advisors to move the students  along the enrollment process so the managers monthly numbers are reached-despite what is actually \"best for the student.\" \r\n\r\nHOWEVER, the biggest obstacle when working at Kaplan, as an admission advisor, is to depend on other departments (i.e. academics, office of student management and financial aid)  to help the potential student with enrolling into school. This enrollment helps the advisor reach their benchmark standard to sustain their job. But other department employees  do not have benchmarks subsequent to their position. These employees in other departments for the most part are inefficient,  irresponsible, and are rude to students and the advisors. \r\nAs an admission advisor, you are responsible to keep the company successful and in operations, but other department employees are not bought into the vison."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Smile, dial, enroll, repeat.
