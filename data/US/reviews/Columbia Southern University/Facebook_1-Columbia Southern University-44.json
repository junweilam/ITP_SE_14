Many good people trying to make a positive impact.", "cons": "Columbia Southern University is a for-profit university. That, in itself, is a significant area to focus on. While the mission and vision are to provide education and opportunities to those who might otherwise not have them, the ultimate goal/aim is to increase enrollments, whatever the cost. There are no admissions standards and limited review of student progress beyond whether the student \"persistently enrolls.\" Keywords like retention and persistence are based solely on numbers, ignoring all qualitative meaning: are students \"persisting\" because they're getting a financial aid check and getting 100s on every assignment regardless of effort/merit? That question is rarely asked, despite lower-level staff reporting entire course grade books that consist of nothing but 100s on every student assignment (true of a large number of courses, not just a handful). Should the retained students actually be retained? While opportunities are important, not everyone is suited for an academic environment. Often, the best service to a student is to lead them in a different direction, one that would cause the student to withdraw from the university. While that may sound negative, it is absolutely the best interest of the student. Continuing to enroll students who cannot successfully complete the coursework (because they don\u2019t have the foundational knowledge, because they don\u2019t speak English, etc.) is essentially stealing from those students: taking their money, but not giving them the opportunity to learn. The fact that there are absolutely no English language requirements for anyone (except international students whose highest degree came from a non-English speaking school\u2026which is a very, very small segment of CSU\u2019s English Language Learners) should be a giant red flag. But again, a profit-fueled company will not turn a student away, regardless of the need. Those two questions only scratch the surface of the disconnect between the company's mission and its actual business practices. The dollars and the numbers always trump the student\u2019s needs/success. Just do a little research into the vast amount of students using cheat sites like Course Hero or boostmygrades.com and the actual quality of the education will appear as what it really is: a mirage.\r\n\r\nThe company is owned by a family, and the company touts its family atmosphere. This is often true, primarily because nepotism runs high in the company. Husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, fathers and sons, etc. often work together and influence the work environment. CSU is very much focused on \"who you know\" rather than \"what you know.\" Promotions are often given based on popularity or family ties rather than based on the best person for the job. HR exists solely to maintain the status quo, not to work to make an environment that supports and encourages successful employees. For example, after several complaints regarding the air quality in part of the building (a presumed mold issue causing excessive sneezing and congestion among many employees), the HR solution was to tell employees to \u201cbuy a plant.\u201d \r\n\r\nThere are many \"fun days\" throughout the year to build the mirage of a happy family culture. Those events, while perhaps good-intentioned, often seem to be a punishment as they occur during work hours: who wants to go to work, but not work? Those who choose not to attend these events must use personal time, vacation time, or unpaid time off. An example of a recent event was a tailgate kickoff: a two-hour picnic in the middle of the day\u2026in August\u2026in South Alabama. After the picnic, everyone had to return to work for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nRegarding turnover, the numbers actually do reveal a lot. Today, there are 18 open positions posted on the University webpage. This does not include the positions only available to current employees. Each pay period, an average 5-8 new employees start. This should imply that the number of staff is growing. In fact, the number of employees has significantly decreased over the past 3 years, as the university, to save money, requires significant justification (need) to replace any vacated position. That means, on average, that more than 5-8 employees leave CSU each pay period (every two weeks). \r\n\r\nThis company is very good at finding people's strengths; it is even better at exploiting those strengths without appropriate reward (compensation only being one type of reward lacking). Once an employee pushes back or asks for commensurate rewards, the employee becomes problematic to the university. The number of employees terminated for \"not fitting in with the culture\" of the university is much larger than one should expect."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Some Really Good and Some Really Bad.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Orange Beach, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The owners strive to keep the family culture.

Also, throwing all management in the same pot may seem extreme and I realize that not everyone is guilty of what's stated below. Unfortunately, the majority are and as a result the culture is deeply affected.\r\n\r\nSince the university has grown, the family culture feels fake and forced. The owners have good intentions but most of their management does not carry any of it out. The management are a bunch of suck ups. They tell the owners what they want to hear and act like a bunch of CSU family culture cheerleaders in front of them, but are completely different to their employees. The employees are rarely praised, instead we are always told what needs to improve and what we may have done wrong. Our ideas are never taken seriously or given any credit. The office politics are horrible and most of the time you feel like a child in grade school. Also, management talks about each other and other employees in front of their employees. This is very wrong and should not be happening, it also puts the employee in an uncomfortable position. \r\n\r\nCommunication is HORRIBLE. Period.\r\n\r\nPromotions, practices, policies, etc. are put into place on a whim without having the tools needed to successfully manage and perform the necessary tasks. This makes the lives of the employee's that do the work miserable. Then, when things don't work out and numbers aren't \"what they should be\" the employees are condemned. Management is always contradicting themselves and, because things are done on a whim and fail, things are always changing. This means that all the work you just did was for nothing. This happens ALL THE TIME and in the numerous departments I've worked for.\r\n\r\nManagement is not transparent by any means and rarely shows any integrity. Also, they do not stick up for their employees and nothing is ever kept in confidence (also my experience in every dept. I've worked for).\r\n\r\nManagement and HR give you the run around when you ask about a policy or pay. The policies in the Employee Handbook don't mean anything because department heads make up their own rules and explanations. HR supports management, not the employees.\r\n\r\nThe company puts on big events like Fall Bash and an annual Christmas Party. These events are amazing and I think its so wonderful that the owners want to do this for their employees. Unfortunately, a lot of the employees have bad attitudes and don't appreciate it as they should.

In my interview I was asked if their religious beliefs would offend me, I was told not to gossip because everyone is related to everyone. Honestly I didn't give it a second thought, mostly because this was an interview, and everyone will say what they think the interviewer wants to hear to get a job.  Once i started to work there, I started to regret my decision, most of the employees are family members to each other.\r\n. \r\n1. There are more meetings than any place I have ever seen. I used to work in IT and when I would need the permission of a supervisor, no one could be found because they would be at their hourly meeting followed by their lunch meeting. Don't try to interrupt their meetings either, they would get upset if you didn't ask for permission and they would get upset if you didn't get the job done, it was a lose lose situation. Fortunately I had a supervisor whom everyone \"feared\" and was allowed to complete the task, no matter what the consequence.\r\n\r\n2. Managers are like that loud obnoxious spoiled kid who holds their breath until they get what they want. I had been a manger before working at CSU and I understood the value of leading a team. I have taken CSU courses on management and their own management doesn't follow their own courses! This place was \"management for dummies\" first time managers who demanded the world. I had to walk a manager away from my teammates cube because she made her cry. Also I am not sure what scientific report they are following, but it cannot be healthy for employee morale to move from one cube to another, literally weekly.\r\n\r\n3. Family atmosphere. This is the same kind of atmosphere you would find from the \"Children of God\" cult. Never in my life had I worked for an organization where you had to pray in order to start the \"Employee Day\" events. It's easy if you don't want to offend anyone, and you call yourself equal opportunity, then keep it to yourself.  You couldn't leave, because \"why would you leave your family?\" You were made to stay outside, and celebrate in their \"forced fun\" activities.

Also CSU will low-ball you in pay especially if you have an advanced degree. They will not pay you what you are worth if you aren't kin to them. They want to work you like a slave for peanuts. They think if you are getting paid $30k they are to get $100k worth of work out of you, I don't work like that! I worked at least 60 hours a week and only got paid what my salary was (not knowing any better) in the beginning that the hours were long! They didn't tell me that. In their mind they thought they were doing you a favor and paying you \"big money\" not! I was placed in a trick bag when I transferred to another department not knowing that the managers/directors would stab me in the back and lie on me about everything. They blamed me for stealing gas! I never stole gas from them people, I have no reason too! My director even said that they believed that I paid too much for parking! Ha! you got to be kidding! i got news for her: big cities, big money! if a parking garage says its $40, its $40 dollars! I can't control that! But they used that against me again get me out. They blamed me for everything!  They talked out of two sides of their mouth, if you got $51 dollars a day to eat, you got $51 dollars! they had a problem with me eating! the write up went on and on and on. Crazy miserable people! They didn't have proof and they thought that I would sign a right up with lies! HAHA not this one. Things I didn't even know anything about. I had nothing to do with. I looked at the write up and it looks like a person in 6 or 7 years old wrote it. My 4 year old niece knows 3 languages and writes better than that. I read it to some lawyers that are working on my case now and they said it was ridiculous how an adult couldn't \"so called\" write up someone with no valid cause. I just laughed because it was ridiculous! And they thought I would be stupid enough to sign some mess like that. If it isn\u2019t signed it\u2019s not valid!  I know if they worked anywhere else, they wouldn't survive a day in a real work environment so they stay at that \"school\" until they retire or diie whatever comes first.  If I had known what I knew now then I would have never taken that job. I would tell anyone not to allow them to bully you into taking a job that\u2019s fewer than 60k.Understand your supervisor will be untrained, uneducated idiots that are prejudice and can't comprehend anything especially strategic planning, training, customer service, etc. If you think differently than them, they will hate you just like they hated me. I didn't depend on my paycheck so I didn't care if I was let go or if I quit, the money was just icing on the cake. When they know you are depended on them they will treat you any kind of way. My house was paid for, my cars were paid for, and I had money in the bank before I worked there so therefore I walked out happy with no regrets. The people that work there will be in that job for the rest of their lives because they don't have the gall to go anywhere else and they have been brainwashed to think that CSU is the only gig in town. I came in the most raggedy car I could find and didn't let them ride in my car so they couldn't know my business. I wore basic clothes to work every day and I keep them out of my business and my social networking. I always heard from people off and on that the people that worked there were weird and I didn't want to believe it but now I do. They weren't going to use my expertise and capitalize on it, because they didn't pay me enough. Lastly, those folks will lie in your face in a New York minute! Grinnnnnn in your face and go back to the director / supervisor to make you look bad if they think you are a threat to them. I expect that coming from people that think that the school is the best thing since sliced bread. Its pitiful how people will do just about anything and be a \"go-along-get-along\" no matter if it\u2019s a lie or if it\u2019s the truth. Words of advice for anyone that wants to work there don't do it. If you absolutely have too, do no more than 6 months and leave! Apply for jobs 24/7 until you find something better.  I thought CSU was a good opportunity because they \"sold\" me on a pipe dream and a pie in the sky; But instead it was a nightmare. The most positive thing was I got my business off the ground on their dime and got the best contacts for my business and passed them on to others that may have not been able to get those contacts and utilized my knowledge, skills, and abilities to get more money while on the clock working for non-regionally accrediated CSU."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Lead Faculty", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "27 May 2018", "job_title": "Lead Faculty in Orange Beach, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people are great.
