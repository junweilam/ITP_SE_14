I enjoy my position, and the Center too, for the most part, but am aware that my situation may in some instances be the exception.", "cons": "These have more to do with how the Center is managed as a whole, rather than day-to-day work experiences, with a couple of exceptions.\r\n\r\nAnnual raises aren't what they used to be.  When they are provided (usually less than 3%/year), they are often lost to increases in insurance premiums, cost hikes in the cafeteria (more on that later), and other employee-borne costs.  \r\n\r\nGiven the current funding crisis (due to NIH cuts and sequestration), the Center is perpetually on the brink of money starvation.  During these times, Center leadership will often make some foolhardy fiscal choices, such as building a flashy skybridge across Eastlake while simultaneously conducting layoffs or cutting funding to vital research programs.  The Center has stepped-up its fundraising efforts and, much to my chagrin, has undertaken the practice of continually pestering its own employees to donate through payroll deduction; this practice has left a very bad taste in the mouths of many here, including some at senior levels.  In a way, may of us already donate the opportunity cost of a better compensation package elsewhere to the Center's noble research causes.\r\n\r\nThe Center in recent years has also \"off-shored\" many campus services and amenities. Most notably, food service has been contracted out to an overpriced, out-of-town outfit.  Lunch used to cost $5, now it's closer to $10 for less quality, smaller portions, and bad attitudes (undoubtedly the fault of inept food services management).  Many of the employees are ex-Hutch food services staff, who I feel were ripped off in this transaction.  The cafes are a sad place.\r\n\r\nFinally, and very importantly, your mileage at the Center will vary greatly depending on your principal investigator.  The Center is a community of much smaller research groups.  Most of the scientists here are great, but a handful verge on sociopathy.  Be sure to ask very pointed questions during your interview, and try to \"feel out\" other members of the staff to see whether they're happy.  Scientists here have carte blanche (HR policy, nor labor laws, nor sometimes even hard reality, can touch them), and can practically get away with anything, and Center human resources is entirely useless when it comes to resolving workplace issues, so it is of crucial importance to figure out whether a particular position is a good match.\r\n\r\nFinal note, the Center often advertises positions that are actually based at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), its clinical partner.

Complete lack of transparency and no value placed on their employees or their careers. There is one performance review performed annually, that does not lead to any sort of opportunities for advancement. Feedback given is vague, and managers don't care about the careers of their employees. No feedback is elicited from coworkers, and those who make the most noise/cause the most drama get all of the attention. A lot of false promises are made and never delivered on.\r\n\r\n2. Similar to reason 1, there is no chance for career advancement or effort placed in developing employee's careers. I was able to learn a lot while at the Hutch, but those opportunities were all things I sought out on my own, and paid for myself. They say each employee receives money for professional development each year, but I did not find that to be true. When I found opportunities I was interested in I was told that there was not money to pay for it (around $500), and I ended up paying out of pocket.\r\n\r\n3. Cold  and political culture. While generally people are very nice, a few bad eggs ruin the culture. People are generally reserved and keep to themselves. Some have very strong opinions and are very disrespectful. If you don't play the political game, you will not be recognized here and will remain invisible.\r\n\r\nIn general, I did appreciate the type of projects I worked on and the skills I obtained working here. This is a good place to work and develop some skills, and then move on. There is no opportunity for career advancement here, nor do they care about your career."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "It's fair", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 May 2016", "job_title": "Statistical Research Associate in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It has very interesting research.

He would tell us (3 person team) which way our chairs were supposed to face when we walked out of the office. Even though Fred Hutch has a huge assortment of classes, I was denied attending any, ever, althoug I was FTE. When interviewed (and this was twice) I stated I did NOT do software dev, and the then manager assured me that since he and our colleague were devs, I would never have to do it. When I walked out, I had 6 software dev assignements. I even hired a tutor but software dev was nowhere to be found in the job description. NONE.\r\n\r\nWhen I quit, upper management (no one is there anylonger, all fired) intstructed met to take my meticulous documentation to the hilarious Fred Hutch HR. I called and emaild for 7 business days before  I realized they had no intention of ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, getting back. I brought a member of Seattle's local TV consumer protection team with me to collect my things. This manager has since been fired. I conferred with the person who was in this job before me, and he revealed that this same manager had physically threatened him, into giving the manager a great annual review.\r\n\r\nInsane. Unfair. Illegal. Avoid Fred Hutch by all means. It looks good on paper, but the abuse level is so high there, it is best to let their shareholders try and houseclean the abuseres before going in there. Not a safe place. NOT."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Get rid of longtime admin employees", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "27 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant I in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for a world renown institution.
