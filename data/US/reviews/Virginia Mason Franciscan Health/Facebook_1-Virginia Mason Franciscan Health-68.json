In the short 3 months I worked under my interim manager, a very negative opinion was developed and my reputation with VM was gone. I later received a very direct and not so polite email demanding that I stop calling the facility, despite my invitation to call and inquire anytime.

Because they don't even work for the same company. I'm sure some generic response by one of those HR business partners will go below this review and my response to them is -> we begged for your help for 3 years with tears in our eyes and you did literally nothing. Oh wait, you did finally put the supervisor in place that we all actually wanted (again...begged for), but by that time it was a \"too little too late\" situation and most of the good people left. \r\n\r\nSo, then my response to VM hr is do better and do it faster.
