My own previous work experience includes both science teaching and education research.\r\n\r\nThere were some decidedly good things about working at LDG. The kind of work it aspires to sits at a rare intersection of practical and principled curriculum design. The group develops curriculum activities and learning sequences that are created, piloted, and revised to be usable by teachers in classrooms, are grounded in design principles that have ties to cognitive and socio-cultural learning theories, and embody the three dimensions of the newly released NGSS. The sequences integrate instruction and assessment around a progression of goals for increasingly complex conceptual understanding and facility with science practice. In partnership with Amplify Science, the LDG has created an initial K-8 science and literacy curriculum program that is being adopted in school districts across the country, and will impact the learning of millions of students. The combination of principled design and broad impact is rare in the world of school curriculum development, which is heavily populated by minimally updated, information-dense textbooks with loosely aligned accompanying activities. \r\n\r\n\tThe majority of people who came to work at the LDG were committed to improving education, invested in good outcomes for children, and ready to work hard toward worthwhile goals. There were many who were very creative, quick to try out and take up new ideas, and put intense thought and effort into development. It was a real pleasure to work with people who were enthusiastic about their work and about creating a quality product. There are unfortunately few opportunities to learn or practice this kind of ambitious curriculum design, particularly as part of a larger team, so few of us came in specifically prepared for it. Most employees came from teaching, and a smaller number from academia, often making for a significant learning curve. Had it been managed differently, this situation might have been fine.", "cons": "The LDG offered an opportunity to work with dedicated people on a product that has the potential to change education in schools, but its leadership and management made the working environment unpleasant, even toxic. While they frequently touted the value of an open, collaborative work environment, the leaders didn\u2019t support the kind of transparency and trust that fosters one. They seemed to cling to the more informal, organic approaches to design and decision-making they had used as a much smaller group in the past. While they encouraged idea-sharing and discussion, they often avoided making even tentative explicit decisions. Despite requests from our team, they were reluctant to try to formally describe curriculum design processes in a way that could have provided a clear focus for training and collaboration in our much larger group. Without having formalized the work of designing curriculum for themselves, they didn\u2019t seem able to define the skills they needed to hire for. They repeatedly hired people who were significantly unprepared for the work, and several times resorted to hiring friends or family members. There were consequently many employees who lacked relevant skills and received only cursory training, but whom leaders nonetheless expected to do the same work as experienced developers. This placed unreasonable demands on new hires, and forced more experienced employees to overextend themselves to try and fill the gaps. In addition, leaders seemed to have allowed previous projects to create a kind of \u2018fiefdom\u2019 culture within the group; when I started, members already seemed to fearfully guard parts of the curriculum they saw as belonging to science or literacy, and thought might be somehow taken from them. The lack of clear processes and decisions, poor hiring and training, and entrenched territoriality unsurprisingly often produced confusion and disagreement. Rather than treating emerging tensions as symptoms, and using them as opportunities to reveal and work on underlying issues, leaders typically tried to find a quick superficial solution, or make them go away by reorganizing personnel, and left the fundamental work culture problems intact. In general, leaders seemed to value product over people - as long as work continued, they did not appear overly concerned with the effects on the people who were doing it. \r\n\r\nCoupled with these organizational issues was a lack of transparency and authenticity in leaders\u2019 communication and interaction. Good collaboration requires transparency and collective understanding, and leaders could be opaque or even secretive about decisions that impacted the team, and the factors and reasoning that led to them. This made their motives seem suspect, and made our work seem like less of a collective effort. I also learned not to trust the content or tone of their communications. They presented a smile and a cheerful tone regardless of whether they were ready to praise or penalize, and the constant forced positivity quickly rang false. I found that if I went to them for help with a concern or a problem, I would get an initial show of empathy and understanding that reassured me, but their subsequent response would be dismissive or even punitive. As I found myself held accountable for requests or directives they hadn\u2019t explicitly made, I learned that some leaders expected that I would understand the intent outside the content of what they said, and who would look for implicit meaning in any communication. These patterns as a whole made it hard to believe what was said, or to trust that the goal posts weren\u2019t about to be moved. \r\n\r\n\tI should have left the LDG sooner, but ambitious curriculum work is pretty rare, and I stayed well beyond the point it was harmful to me. I believe some things have improved since I left - the curriculum and its development processes have been clarified out of necessity, and most employees have been there for a while and are familiar with the work, but its leaders are the same. I don\u2019t think I can recommend it to anyone who hopes to apply to be part of an open, collaborative curriculum project.
