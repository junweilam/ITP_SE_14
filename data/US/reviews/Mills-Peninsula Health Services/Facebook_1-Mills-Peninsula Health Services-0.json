Disruptions to their system causes people to have emotional meltdowns, who then later try to snipe you behind your back to your 1 up rather than having a direct conversation with their colleague. When asking others about simple regulatory expectations, facility personnel have a myriad of excuses or some non-evidence based rationale to explain their poor decision making or overall lack of clinical experience. It seems that many managers/directors at this facility have a complete lack of emotional intelligence and behave like small children despite your efforts of being cordial and professional. The physicians here are overly engaged and involve themselves in the day to day operations while making little effort to hold their peers accountable. For example, frontline nursing and ancillary staff are ostracized for wearing hospital-owned scrubs outside the building, regardless of the duration, but physicians are allowed to come and go wearing hospital issued scrubs. Physicians are also allowed to violate hospital policies as long as they secure a waiver from medical staff office. The culture here is volatile, energy draining, and TOXIC. The cons outweigh the pros at this campus.

In fact, all of us doctors were put in trainings to teach us how to bill the patient more.  We are even in meetings where some of the top paid doctors discuss how to use tax evasion to our benefit.  Several doctors, the good ones, have all quit, so this place is very desperate in hiring.  Some of the other departments may have better leaders, but overall, MPHS/PAMF is under a productivity model, where the doctors are under pressure to bill more at the patient's expense so that they can get paid more proportionally themselves.  Additionally, there is a huge gender bias.  If you start unveiling the dirt, the male doctors are praised for unethical practices described above and thus are paid more.
