Corporate insists on purchasing whatever they can get for assorted drugs due to envisioned shortages, but then expects you to handle the mess of returning everything when there is a surplus. Sometimes, they order things without your knowledge and they simply show up in the pharmacy. Worst of all, I worked with a manager who was constantly gaslighting you about what she told you to do and seemed to make decisions at the spur of the moment based on what she wanted for the day and then turns around and blames you for the fallout of her decision later down the line. Producing this hostile work environment leads to a situation where people train for X amount of time and then leave - forcing the remaining staff members to deal with the fallout of shortstaffing and constantly training people."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Supervisor", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Shift Supervisor in Dorchester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice people to work with", "cons": "Pay slightly below level Not enough stuff"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great first job out of PT school", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Physical Therapist in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "best salary in greater boston area", "cons": "outdated facility, limited equipment, little area for professional growth"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Na", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Certified Pharmacy Technician in Dorchester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not very demanding physically or emotionally", "cons": "Not great salary at start neither after years of experience"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "n/a", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Pharmacy Technician in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "not stressful, workload very doable", "cons": "low salary\r\nno bonus\r\nno fix techs"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "RN", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Dorchester, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not much.
