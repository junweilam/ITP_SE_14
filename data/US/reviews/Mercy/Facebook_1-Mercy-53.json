I began at Mercy Springfield as a Unit Secretary at Mercy's minimum wage- $15 hourly. This was the bare minimum I was willing to accept, and had hoped for $17-20 hourly. After being there almost a year and no raise, I was making the same as a cashier in the gift shop. This was especially insulting because I worked on a critical care COVID unit during several of the major spikes. I saw no hazard pay, no increase over someone who wipes trays in the cafeteria. We need food service employees and cashiers- but someone who directly interacts with COVID positive individuals should absolutely receive much higher pay. Mercy is widely known for their lack of investment in employees. You'll find better pay and benefits elsewhere, and bonuses are almost nonexistant unless you're a physician. As an administrative professional, I was totally ignored by company management. If you're not a physician or nurse (RN, not LPN), you are unlikely to receive any kind of bonus, meaningful pay or benefits increase or even words of gratitude in company emails. While nurses saw massive incentive pay during COVID (almost none now, though), admin assistants/clerical individuals got nothing. Most weren't even making $15/hour when the minimum went into effect, so they considered their new \"raise\" a win. HR policies are very antiquated. While most companies acknowledge that no candidate will likely meet every single requirement- and they acknowledge that the right candidate probably won't- and encourage everyone to apply, Mercy still requires candidates to check. every. box to be eligible for the position. Even if your past career experience proves that you're clearly very qualified, if your education or other qualifications don't meet every requirement in the posting, you'll be ineligible. This same rhetoric goes for moving within the company. I submitted over 25 internal applications for positions, all of which I was more than qualified for, and never got a single interview request. It's not only an outdated way of approaching talent management, but it excludes so many candidates who are qualified, and creates a hostile hiring process that goes on and on. Then the company wonders why their applicant pipeline has dried up. It's because of mismanagement, and the word has gotten out into the community not to bother. Executives would often do their \"PR rounds\" as I called them- visiting medical units, shaking hands with employees, chatting and telling everyone how much they're appreciated. Never once was this followed up with actions of gratidue-just hot air. Talk is cheap, but actions speak. Enough said. Overall, you're better off going with another health system. It's true that they're all pretty similar- nobody gets into healthcare to get rich. But you deserve to be well compensated for your time and efforts, both physical and emotional. You deserve to be treated with dignity and given the proper resources to do your job well. Mercy isn't the solution for any of those."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Does not value employees", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Lead Clinical Research Coordinator in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Patients and coworkers are the best part of working here.", "cons": "Leadership is out of touch with actual day to day job responsibilities.

If you get hired at $15, expect to stay there indefinitely.\r\n\r\n-Benefits are just okay. 401(k) matching is very small, health insurance prices keep inching upward. \r\n\r\n-Executive leadership team truly think of themselves as messiahs, sent from the heavens above.

I have nothing good to say about this company at all.", "cons": "I worked long hours, listening to horrible people cuss at me and tell me how terrible of a person I was.\r\nMercy preaches about how family orientated they are, how much they invest in their employees... Don't believe any of that. Need a day off to take your kids to the doctor on short notice? Better hope its an emergency. If they don't approve immediately you'll be asked to reschedule your kid's appointment. Sure, for the most part, that's acceptable, but as someone who invests everything I am into my children, it's not worth it. Happen to be a working mother? Have a young child, perhaps one that's breastfeeding? Sure, you're able to do that. Absolutely. As long as your child only eats within one of the allotted time frames of your breaks, if they don't you have to clock out and won't be paid. Granted, this is the norm for most companies, but do most companies say that they highly encourage breastfeeding and will do everything they can to support you - but then tell you that your 8-week old infant has to adhere to a very specific feeding schedule or else you won't be paid? Not to mention your scheduled breaks will never be at the same time. One day you'll have a 30-minute lunch at 12:30 pm, the next day its at 1:15 pm. Not a huge deal until you're...ya know... literally trying to supply food for your child. And on pregnancy, if you haven't been with the company for a year before you get pregnant/give birth... you'll 8 weeks off work. Youll grow a literal human being, and they'll tell you how wonderful it is and how amazing and \"anything we can do!\" and then you get 8 weeks to adjust to that new child and the way your life is changing before your thrust back into an unforgiving job.\r\nWant to work overtime to gain some extra money? Well, the only time you can is if they specifically offer it. If you happen to stay late on a call, too bad. I worked 8 minutes over my shift, they asked that I come into work 15 minutes late the next day to even it out so they wouldn't have to pay them overtime. And it wasn't even something I had control over! You're not allowed to clock out or stop taking calls until the end of your shift, so if you get off work at 5:30 pm, but get stuck on a call at 5:25 pm and it goes over the end time of your shift... guess who has gets reprimanded? You.\r\nOh, and similarly on that subject... My position was scheduling patients for diagnostic imaging (MRI,ct,mammo, ultrasounds, etc). During the call you are supposed to obtain all insurance information, schedule the appointment, clarify requiremtents (fasting, etc), complete all registration (phone numbers, email, providers, etc), create an estimate for said testing, tell the patient the estimate, collect payment on new, current, and past balances, note the account of what was discussed and payments taken/not/why, finish the call, reiterate the appointment information... all within under 5 minutes. And if the call ends and you have something left to do (like finishing a note/payment etc), you have less than a minute to do so. If you go over that time the managers get a notification and you'll get a message \"you've been off the call for however long\". If you don't get back onto the next call ASAP they'll basically kick you into the next one. Doesn't matter if you're done or not. \r\nCollecting payments... Sure, go ahead and tell a 90-year-old woman with cancer that she owes $8,000 for her upcoming appointment and has $200,000 in medical debt to the hospital. Ask her how to shed like to take care of that today, if she wants to make a payment on that. I'll be honest, I pretended as I didn't even see it. No way was I asking someone that. $500? Sure, I'll ask if you'd like to pay that, or set up a payment plan. more than $2,000? Not likely. I know what the real world is like, I know how hard it is just to pay the electric bill. I'm not telling a single mother with a sick child that she owes $2,000 for an MRI, and has $30,000 in past due balances. You can kiss my behind. \r\nOn top of that, they don't only want you to ask for these ridiculous payments, they expect you to. they expect each scheduler to collect $10,000 a month from patients (no commission or reward either so what the point? Oh yeah... makes it easier on the hospital). There's really no discipline if you don't other than them making you feel horrible for \"not supporting the ministry and those we serve\". They don't care. They are really truly don't. Yes, I understand medicine is expensive. I get that, and eventually, the patients will know. But for the love of everything, don't put that on us. You have people in billing for a reason.\r\nDo all of that, for 60+ calls a day, for bad hours, and terrible patients... It's miserable.\r\nWork from home? Sure! Not any different than working in the office. Yeah you'll be in your own house and you can wear whatever you want, but other than that it's no different. Say you have young kids at home, or school-age children out for the summer (or in my case, unable to find childcare or have other home issues) and need to take a break to tend to them? Highly frowned upon. Your life doesn't matter, your kids don't matter, your needs don't matter.\r\nThis is a very high-paced position, very detail orientated, you're expected to give your all 100% of the time but if you make a mistake or need a moment, or have any needs of your own? You're a failure. \r\nThere arent many opportunities to move up in the company either, so unless you want to be stuck in a dead-end job taking endless calls from unforgiving clients for the rest of your life...It's not worth it.\r\nIt's a miserable company, has poor management, and is not worth the pay. You, your family, and your mental sanity are worth more than this job.

For me the application and interview process was 2.5 months. My projected start date was an additional 2.5 months after accepting the job offer due to pre-employment onboarding requirements. Well, a few weeks into the process, I learned what they call \"onboarding\" is their way of not paying employees for things other employers usually just include in paid employee orientation. Mercy frames it as wanting employees to be able to start their jobs on day one. And because of \"at will\" employment, they can demand all this work of people pre-employment and then just change their mind about hiring you. And that was my fate. I naively thought there would have to be a legitimate reason to rescind a job offer (for instance, a failed drug screen or background check). \r\n\r\nWhen their onboarding process quickly became much more than it was described to be (e.g., given 72 hours to complete hours of work as if I can just drop my life without notice or pay in order to complete tasks that absolutely could have waited until after I started being paid), I stood up for myself and expressed desire to be compensated in some form for the work. They responded by firing me. After all the time they took from me and the disruption to my life, they refused to dignify my request for a brief discussion about this decision or even just more information about why they came to this decision. I was told I'm still eligible for re-hire. \r\n\r\nNow that I've had some time to digest what happened, I believe I dodged a bullet. As a strong female professional, I know it would have been toxic to work for a team where people could be retaliated against for raising reasonable concerns or setting boundaries. I'm mid-career and I've never been disciplined or fired from a job. So it felt a bit like I traveled to the twilight zone, causing me to temporarily questioned my sense of reality. Just bizarre. Although looking back there were some warning signs I overlooked because I was excited about the work.\r\n\r\nMercy is a big organization, so I'd expect how much individual managers take advantage of at-will employment varies considerably among departments. I was supposed to join a surgery team."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Could be better but not a bad place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Medical Assistant in Van Buren, AR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If u are in the right place, the ppl are great ppl and positive and they have good benifits and retirement.", "cons": "Health insurance is not affordable unless u have two incomes.

Slightly makes up for the below average pay.", "cons": "The \u201cMission\u201d: \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s just a song & dance \r\n\r\nEver since Mercy went corporate they have lost sight of the very mission Catherine McCauley set out to accomplish. Working in a business role has shown me how greedy this company has become, it was never like this, that is, until the nuns were pushed out and Mercy went \u201ccorporate\u201d. They have an amazing PR team which pushes the propaganda of their \u201cmission\u201d. This is likely to appease the nuns that are still around and make them think that Catherine\u2019s mission is still alive and well. I hate to say it but, it\u2019s not. The executives do not care about the frontline staff. Various arbitrary changes are constantly implemented to \u201cstreamline\u201d processes, these measures in fact generate additional revenue, or cut costs. You\u2019d think that this is a for profit hospital with how money hungry they are.\r\n\r\nThe lack of compassion that is shown for employees is appalling. Executives and the like are only worried about the money, each patient, each employee is just another number in their eyes. It didn\u2019t always use to be like this. While executives get bonuses of hundreds of thousands dollars, we get a measly $40 taxed Christmas bonus in our check. The insurance plans though good, aren\u2019t as good as they have been (yes, healthcare costs are on the rise). To get the cheapest care you must go to a Mercy facility ultimately giving your hard earned money back to Mercy. Although PTO accrual is good, you\u2019re required to use the PTO for Holidays. Merit raises are capped at 4%, given anually. You have better odds seeing pigs fly before earning this 4%.\r\n\r\nThose involved with patient care are the only persons keeping the mission alive, the executives make the decisions that Managers and Supervisors must relay to the little guys. Those in these managerial and supervisory roles are simply at the Mercy (pardon the pun) of what the top brass want and half the time don\u2019t agree with the decisions that are made by the executives but have to bite their tongue or they\u2019ll be ousted for someone willing to implement the changes. Each department has its good and bad apples, I\u2019m fortunate to have an amazing Manager willing to go the extra mile, some aren\u2019t so lucky. \r\n\r\nThose around prior to the \u201ctakeover\u201d can attest to these changes and it doesn\u2019t seem to be getting better.   A company which was once a dream to work at for 15+ years and build a career has now become another mundane job. Long time employees are fleeing for retirement, tired of the politics and red tape that have ensued with going corporate."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Therapist II", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Westbrook, ME", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Providing the best service possible for the patients, caring, compassionate, best doctor's ever, well informed and up to date on substance abuse issues.
