Sometimes it isn't clear why they like someone else over you. If you are a favorite you're good. But if you aren't they will find any reason to write you up until they can let you go. For example they will write you up for having a slow week eventhough in admissions you inevitably have slower weeks than others. Do not share anything personal with your manager. If you aren't a favorite they will manipulate the personal things you have told them to force you to quit. Management will isolate you from the rest of your coworkers to bully you further. They are deceptively nice in the beginning but don't fall for it. They will be your best friend until they stab you in the back. Benefits are horrible. Just PTO so when you get sick you have to use time that could have been vacation and it accumulates so slowly. Health insurance is super expensive. Also if you call out you get a point.
