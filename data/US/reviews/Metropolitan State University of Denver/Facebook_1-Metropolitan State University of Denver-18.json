Many students are first-gen college students, MSU Denver is open enrollment, a Hispanic Serving Institution, and generally has the highest percentage of students of color in Colorado. Some programs are competitive enough regionally that they are top picks for students who could get into a more prestigious University. With the lowest (or close to the lowest) tuition in the state the value for the student is truly remarkable! This is a good place for educators who want to make an impact; focus on teaching (currently at a 4/4 lecture load with roughly an 80% teaching, 10% research, 10% service expectation) ; do not have, or do not desire to have, an R2 or R1 caliber research practice (you can make tenure on a less robust research practice), can survive on the salary (has other sources of income and/or; has a partner with a full time job, doesn't have kids, already lives in the area, or is a home owner relocating from a more expensive housing market.)", "cons": "As of 2022 Colorado is 49th in the nation in funding higher ed per student. Arizona is 50th \u2013 though that is a little bit of a misnomer because ASU has tens of thousands on online students who comparatively cost less per pupil to educate. So, per in person pupil Colorado is probably dead last. MSU Denver, in turn is the lowest funded University in Colorado, thus the headline. It could be the lowest funded University in the US \u2013 I wouldn't be surprised. The problem is due to systemic State constitutional issues (google \"Tabor amendment\") that were passed during Colorado's small-government libertarian heyday and will likely never be fixed. Instead of being ashamed by the dismal state of higher-ed and seeking to rectify it, the current Democratic/Libertarian governor Polis's messaging and actions seek to de-emphasize the value of higher education. This situation is so intractable it has its own term \"The Colorado Paradox\" which seeks to answer the question of how Colorado is able to maintain a robust economy with such dismal higher ed. The answer is... Educated people from other states continue to move here in droves. What this means: \u2022 Non-competitive salaries \u2022 Understaffed administrative offices and/or staffed with junior level people. (ex. it routinely takes 4-5 months for HR and Financial Aid to approve a work-study student to begin work.) \u2022 Constant exodus of talent and turnover among competent staff \u2022 10% faculty service expectations ballooning to unsustainable levels to make up for staffing shortages \u2022 Faculty regularly doing the job staff would do at a different institution; academic advising, tech. support, facilities management \u2022 All of this culminating in workload expectations that are not aligned with the salary or the stated goals or values of the institution"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Amazing Benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You receive 4 weeks of vacation and 4 weeks of sick time, plus holidays which most are moved to the week between Christmas and New Years to give you that time off.
