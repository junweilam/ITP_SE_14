The benefits system is also very odd. You are awarded 14 PTO hours per month, but what HR doesn't tell you is that over the summer you will be REQUIRED to leave an hour early, and whether or not you do, you will have one hour per day docked from your hours. That ends up adding up to about 20 hours per month for 3 months. Overall, although the people really are very nice, the university has a very \"grow your own\" mentality in which most staff grew up in Cape, and have worked at SEMO their whole lives.
