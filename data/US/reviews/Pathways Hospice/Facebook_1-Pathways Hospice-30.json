Pushed daily to do more with fewer/no resources. No effort whatsoever to retain the best, most dedicated employees or physicians/NPs which has resulted in revolving door and poor morale. Seasoned staff must train new hires who are then paid more than those with years of seniority. President leads by force, places emphasis on increasing census numbers without the resources to do it. Management resistant to change outdated processes, unresponsive in a crisis. Clinical director always \u201cin a meeting.\u201d Pathways used to have a team of dedicated providers who loved their work. That is no longer the case. President signed over all control of operations to Care Synergy which ran it into the ground. Despite claims to the contrary, Pathways does not operate independently of Care Synergy. Care Synergy sits on the board!. Expect your position and work hours/salary to look nothing like what you are hired to do. Those who stay are abused to the point that they can no longer tolerate the situation and quit. \u201cThanks for all you do\u201d means nothing when management actions speak to the contrary. Mass exodus of employees, unstable environment, repeated furloughs because of the debt created by president. Most experienced and well trained staff are now gone. President blames every issue on the pandemic, even problems that existed prior. Takes no ownership of His bad decisions. Busies himself with worthless tasks such as changing mission statement and scheduling more \u201cemployee engagement sessions\u201d to try to save face with no concerted effort to change. Expect to be unseen and unheard by your manager. In the event of a problem or misunderstanding, the staff is to blame\u2026always. Expect annual evaluation from manager who holds down score to avoid having to pay people more for their hard work and dedication. Expect to hear a lot about \u201cfinancial headwinds\u201d while Care Synergy rakes in the cash. In the event of another pandemic, expect President to jump to head of the line for HIS vaccination prior to employees who are on the front lines of caregiving\u2026.expect him to have his picture taken while doing it. Nothing will change until there is a management overhaul from the top. Those who remain are looking elsewhere.
