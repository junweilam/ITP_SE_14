Cannot utilize the tutorials to learn because workload is so heavy for one person. Not a positive place to work. At least not administratively. Under-minded by other staff. They say they will help you, but willing to throw one under the bus. Was told in the interview that the President works 365 days a year, but I did not have to. That is not true. She really wants someone to be there all hours of the day, night, and weekends. She should have just said that so she could have found to right person. Trying to sugar coat the position creates falsehoods. The job is a teardown to one\u2019s self-esteem. Got a phone call before I could even get out of the building saying it is not me. I was like number 6 or 7. Therefore, high turnover. Since the President has only been at BSU for 4 years herself, she is averaging two assistants a year either by not a \"good fit\" or the assistant left on their own. In my interview with another Director to see if HR could find me something else, I was told the President is out of touch with the processes. She expected a quick turn around when the process does not allow for a quick turnaround. The President has a public email that has over 11K emails. She would not let me clean it up so the emails she needed could be found quick and easy. Then I was penalized for not seeing everything that was needed. After leaving, so much negative information came my way about the Office of the President, that I wished I had known beforehand so I could have just tuned down the position. It was not worth the headache.
