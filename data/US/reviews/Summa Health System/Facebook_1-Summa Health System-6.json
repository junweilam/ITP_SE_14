Not at all allowed to leave my desk. Calls would drop into our headset one after another and if your calls were too long or if you were wrapping up and documenting in a patient's chart you were penalized. OH, and getting Covid 3 times, while working in Healthcare, it'll get you fired. But first, they force you to get vaccinated. When you're working from home. This place is absolutely the most mismanaged, disorganized, income focused, put on a good face, most unethical, group of trash I've ever met. Patient care is 100% not the focus. The goal is to keep calls (to patients, paging physicians, triaging, refill requests, suicide callers, limited English speakers, etc) under 5 minutes. You get 21 days off a year. But you have to take PTO for all mandatory off holidays. And if you get sick, you get pointed. If your family gets sick, you get pointed. I mentioned my family had Covid 3 times while I worked for Summa, for 12 months. I had to call off a lot but I was willing to pick up hours or even reduce to part time so I could care for myself and family. Further, this year was personally terrible. Close family deaths, broken rib, stage 3 pelvic prolapse, plus a chronic illness that often leaves me bedridden. Taking time off is not at all possible. Every single time I hurt myself, was sick, or my kids were sick, I got SUMMA doctor's notes or was willing to provide my grandma's obituary, for example. I felt so guilty every time I called off, I called my nurse supervisor and took a LIVE COVID TEST just so no one would write me up. You cannot take off work. Nope. Not an option. They pointed me to the point that I had to quit before termination. ......but my patient satisfaction ratings and audits were almost 5 stars or whatever point system they had. I would often take double the calls of my peers in a shift. Further, when I expressed my feelings my job was in danger no team lead, supervisor, manager, or director would help me. I contacted HR and they were also the worst (BTW I have a bachelor's in human resources). No one would help me. The leadership in the Clinical Access Center, with few exceptions, are not worth one single penny. My health was failing and I was forced to go on leave for surgery but thankfully got wind that I was going to be terminated, so I resigned. I could go on and on. When I was hired, they promised I could get on to a 7-3 shift and that was never offered even though when I was hired I was clear on my needs, instead they put on new people for desirable shifts just so they could fill seats. They also promised a $2hr raise at 90 days. That didn't come. And when I voiced that I wasn't being paid for the lunch shifts I worked through, they basically told me to shut up about it if I wanted to keep my job. I have never been so stressed out in my life than when I worked there. I am so relieved to be working for an organization who want to employ people with a good work ethic AND morals."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good team", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Inventory Technician in Akron, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My team is great to work with.", "cons": "The pay is lower than most other locations."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Love the job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Apr 2023", "job_title": "NST in Barberton, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great people and management cares for us", "cons": "they have some of the fewer benefits and less pay than other palces"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Micro-Management times 10", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Apr 2023", "job_title": "HOA Specialist in Akron, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay, Benefits and meeting new people.", "cons": "Narcissistic Management, unfair scheduling and misuse of many policies & procedures.
