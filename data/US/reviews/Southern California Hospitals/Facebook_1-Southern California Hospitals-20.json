Once I came 30 mins early to save myself a working \"COW\", another RN told me that its her computer because she was using it yesterday. %^&*U****%$$!!\r\n-They have the worst EHR and Medication dispensing system (that seemed to be broken every day.\r\n-80% of the staff that is working here are travelers.\r\n-Fights between staff are a norm. Like a charge nurse literally shouting at one of the nurses in the middle of the nurse's station.\r\n-You literally have to do everything for the doctors including having to hound them and waste your time paging them the whole day. You have to put every single order for the doctors.\r\n-I was hired with 2 other RN's who were offered almost $15k new hire bonus, but they still left after 2 mos because of the horrendous working conditions."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "HORRIBLE", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Caregiver, CNA in Culver City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "leaving at the end of the shift", "cons": "Ppl don't come to work ALWAYS short handed, dirty, unprofessional lazy rude people."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Avoid at all costs", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Van Nuys, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Easy to get hired.
