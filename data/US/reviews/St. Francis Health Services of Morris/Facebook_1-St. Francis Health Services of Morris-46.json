When our program coordinator of 10+ years found another job and quit, we were without one for months. The different house managers would rotate in to help run our house. Then they hired a young girl fresh out of college, to do the job. She would have been great if she really wanted the job. However, she viewed the job as a \"stepping stone\" to a career in the social work field rather than a career in itself. She resigned within 6 months when she found a job \"in her field\" and after she had run our house into the ground. The company ended up closing our house and all the staff had to choose whether to quit or stay on with the company, by transferring to another home. If you chose to transfer, you could bump someone out of their position at another home, depending on your seniority.

That is actually a load of crap because they are a privately owned company and can make their own choices. It is very sad that there is so much employee turnover because the residents deserve better. We have lost so many great care providers due to the company not giving any pay creases. Not even a cost of living raise. I have worked there between five-and-ten years and have yet to see an increase for anyone. They should at least be honest and tell you when you interview that the mere $11 an hour you will make is all you will ever make thrre unless the government does something. What a cop out.
