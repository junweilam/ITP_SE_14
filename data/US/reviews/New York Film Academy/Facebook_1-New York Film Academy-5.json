The most popular programs are called 1-year Conservatories, they are usually between 9 and 11 months. Some campuses offer some of the disciplines as 3-year degree programs where you would graduate with a bachelor of fine arts. The degrees have only recently obtained the legitimacy of regional accreditation, although very few people, and absolutely zero students understand what one type of accreditation means relative to another. \r\n\r\n Courses like Game Design and Illustration either do not run at all, or only run when a few kids are naive enough to sign up without asking too many questions. The school is dominated by international students from wealthy backgrounds, or state-funded education. When a domestic student comes to NYFA, either they too are from money, or in the sadder situation, make the unfortunate choice to attend a ~50k a year program (often mortgaging the entire cost + living expenses) for a skillset that provides almost zero chance for gainful employment.\r\n\r\nPrograms like Acting and Filmmaking ARE intensive and challenging and contain lots of information. However, in my 7 years of time at the school studying the curriculum and layouts for all programs, I notice that the programs are packed more so because of regulations and want of a quick turn around than because it would provide an enhanced learning experience to the student.\r\n\r\n The school sells its programs as \"accelerated\" (read: money mill), which essentially means the course load is so immense and the time between semesters so small that most students slime through the projects and whatever skills they learn stick for only so long as they\u2019re in the program, and then are dumped out, ~$50k poorer with a very weak remunerative skillset.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to know about the internal operations of NYFA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school's founder was a somewhat eccentric millionaire that had a penchant for subservient asian women and maintained a troupe of them until his passing. One could find him seated in his office, overlooking Battery Park or Union Square, beard and hair being trimmed with scissors, feet massaged, being served espresso by his harem of Asian women ostensibly imported with him from his time abroad prior to creating the film school. \r\n\r\nOther than that, my reflection is that the man was indeed a genius. He realized he can sell expensive tuition to people who loved acting and filmmaking but possessed zero talent for it. He realized that the words \"New York'' in front of anything give it a veneer of respectability and credence in the eyes of the international community. He realized even further that Americans will grow to respect a domestic business or organization if the international impression is favorable even if none is justified. He paid well for talented young people to bring energy, sexiness and enthusiasm to his business. He also knew he was selling sexiness--the campus locations were originally New York, then Los Angeles, and finally Miami. While you can make an argument that NY/LA are media/entertainment/film destinations, Miami leaves you scratching your head. The point is that bored rich kids from abroad are not coming to study in Sandusky, Ohio and he knew that. They want to come to New York and LA and see the illusion of the United States. NYFA is all about illusion and its puts on a great presentation.\r\n\r\nMany have commented in the other reviews that there is a disparity in pay between people working at the school. I believe the old man was much more liberal in how much he paid his employees because he had an extremely high bar for output, efficiency, and work ethic. He also expected that everyone would be bringing money into the school by selling the programs. Those that were not actively selling programs to people quite clearly get paid less. \r\nWith his passing, that close-to-the-heart business ethic went out the window for the sterile divided labor approach of a much larger corporation that pays bare bones and cares little about rewarding and retaining high performers, instead insisting on uniformity and compliance to menial details. This resulted in NYFA bleeding its most talented and respectable employees and replacing them with aloof and incompetent ones desperate for even a meager paycheck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe founder's death somewhere in 2016-2018 left the door open for his son to grab the reins of the family business. As is usually the case when a business is inherited, and as other reviewers have noted, the new principle brought little to enhance the business and had many idiosyncrasies, ideas, and behaviors that many found annoying, counterproductive, and generally off putting. Almost every interaction I witnessed him being a part of was muddied up by his awkward demeanor. He lacked the charm, wit and insight of his father, but maintained his arrogant and condescending attitude all the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning the day to day operations of the school is a motley crew of ivy-league know-it-alls that take turns talking themselves in circles on all types of issues. They fancy themselves as artists more than administrators of a college and as such you will find the president of the school playing director of a silly commercial that plays like a bad daytime television advertisement, or the vice president pirouetting down the hallways talking to anyone who will listen to him about his workout routine or how much he spent on his most recent turtleneck purchase. Many years of complete comedy are in store for you if you do decide to take the job!\r\n\r\nUnderneath the president and senior vice president of the school is a cabal of vice presidents that range from a long-in-the-tooth used car salesman with a fake smile and an overt interest in what the younger female employees did over the weekend and an australian woman who finds not only a way to implement a completely self-destructive internal software system as her first act as a VP, but also ways to make the receptionists\u2019 life hell--way to take on more responsibility! You would be hard pressed to find anyone at the company who can tell you exactly what these two people are responsible for, and even harder pressed to find an answer that justifies their purported salary, but there are hundreds of unsolvable mysteries at that school, so why act surprised?\r\n\r\nThe faculty is NYFA's most attractive quality, but not without flaws, in some cases, major ones. Each department has a head faculty member, some have been resting on their laurels for decades, some are still active participants in their given field/discipline. Some are well-rounded educators, some are simply a name to give the department a boost with zero teaching ability.\r\nMany of the faculty are dedicated, hardworking professionals. I can't think of one that wasn't to be honest. They work hard to train unappreciative, petulant, and entitled rich kids (that is really the only type of student who can afford NYFA) and more than likely will never receive anything close to a tenured position or full-time status at the least. Some have very little classroom training and spend the majority of the day crudely providing instructions on a technical filmmaking technique, others lack the ability to manage the interpersonal interactions requisite between instructor and student.\r\n Despite the shortcomings, the biggest disadvantage the faculty faces is their complete lack of organization and leadership. This trickles down in a myriad of ways and is much more pronounced in the small programs that get less love and money, leaving students in those programs a much different impression of the school.\r\n\r\nMoving on to the school\u2019s philosophy and moral compass: NYFA and its faculty are fiercely, unapologetically, to the point of lacking any self-reflection, far left. You may be surprised how much politics comes up in discussions if you choose to work there--especially since everyone has an arts background, never worked a job outside of film/tv, and almost nobody has any education in STEM, political science, Econ or Business or Law--many, especially the most senior, seem very quick to wax philosophical about their views and to disagree with them is to brand yourself as a monster incapable of critical thinking or compassion. You probably shouldn't even consider working in the Arts or higher education if you find yourself a moderate or conservative, let alone working in NY, LA, or Miami at a film school. \r\n\r\nAfter the head leadership and the faculty is what we can call Administration. At NYFA, there are essentially 3 components of Administration, there are other little side jobs like the Dean of Students office and the Equipment room people, but who really cares about them?:\r\n\r\n 1. Recruitment or Sales--these are the people on the phones, they call themselves admission representatives, not counselors, because they are really not qualified to counsel anyone on anything. Like the other departments, people come and go often, mostly because making calls to people in Nigeria to solicit them to pay 50k+ to journey to an expensive foreign country to learn acting is a fool\u2019s errand, but where there is a will there's a way. Almost entirely men and white. It must be the evil nature in their hearts that draws them to such a reprehensible line of work. \r\n\r\nSupporting the \u201ccallers\u201d are a few \"recruiters'' that are paid to find stray international students from a basket of countries. They are the principle drivers of business for NYFA--as domestic students are generally not foolish enough to swallow the ~$50k a year price tag when many other options exist in their home state. NYFA has an outrageous Chinese student population at the LA campus and before the disastrous economic conditions hit, South African, Saudi Arabian, and Brazilian students dominated the other school in NY. The recruiters also look to India and Nigeria for students and they are successful. Even in these countries, with especially large levels of poverty, NYFA manages to seduce the wealthiest kids to come study for a year or two in the sexy destinations of NY or LA. The recruiters and sales people are probably the highest paid group in NYFA outside of senior officers and high level faculty. I see many comments talking about sexism and pay disparities, but as far as I know, most of the recruiters were female and they were usually paid more than their male counterparts, not because of sexism, but because their recruitment efforts yielded more business for the school--a meritocratic remnant of the deceased founder\u2019s philosophy.\r\n\r\n2. Bursar, Financial Aid, and Registrar--these people are responsible for all the day-to-day state and federal requirements involving different higher education laws and regulations. They make sure the paperwork is up to date and do the more generalized tasks that require little to no customer (student) interaction. The Registrar, usually an important role at any major college, is usually replaced every 3-6 months in the 7 years I was an employee. The most underpaid people working at the school were undoubtedly the people who worked in the registrar and bursar offices doing the basic paperwork--many give up the job in favor of something else within a few weeks or months at most.\r\n\r\n3. Media, Advertisement, etc: NYFA's image is its best feature. As mentioned before, you can place the words ``New York\" in front of anything and people will light up if you tell them you went there. Try it! Say to someone, \u201cI went to New York Steak House last night for dinner, best steaks ever!\u201d, or, \u201cI learned how to pilot a hot air balloon at the New York Institute for Air Balloonery\u201d, and people will not only accept it without question, but nod fiercely in approval about what a respected establishment it is. With their work half-done for them, the people working in NYFA\u2019s Marketing department are generally low-paid and skilled glad-hands who plaster the brand NYFA over every document, social media post, and stupid blog article they can in a day\u2019s worth of work. They use old videos of interviews with movie stars and directors voraciously intent on bleeding out every ounce of credibility one can muster from the association of the school\u2019s name with any Bollywood/Hollywood/Nollywood project or star."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Manager", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Burbank, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great co-workers and awesome location to work!

If you manage to do all that and ask for a raise, HR (the worst I've ever experienced) will give you a million reasons why you can't get one.

They've convinced themselves that this is a normal workplace (that it's \"worse\" elsewhere) but trust me -- it's not. It's not normal to not know what your job is going in, then to muddle your way through, being treated like scum. It's not normal to be at the mercy of middle-aged men who are fighting because of their fragile egos, and who use you as their pawns.

The amount of financial aid available as actual grants is so small that students that need residence are looking at 100K to 200K in student loans to attend. Due to this the student body is probably 70% intl. and 15% Veterans. The Intl. students all have language issues so your american acting student is learning the craft of acting with people who don't speak English well, from what I noticed  many of the veterans that attend are emotionally unbalanced and has lead to some awkward incidents on both campuses, and most of the domestic students that do attend  are such a mess, they could not get into any other performing arts college. Many of the students are very wealthy so they just miss classes which screws it it for students that have to work with them on projects. So the attrition rate is horrendous and students leave all the time, thus the tread mill of a very aggressive telemarketing and outside admissions (really sales ) dept. of 50 or 60 people to bring in students.

They don't tell you everything upfront about the job in the interview because if they did, no one would work there. You aren't just a summer camp counselor, they put you into a category whether that be \"driving everyday to lax, planning activities(with little to no budget even though people's tuition for camp is outrageous)\" etc. These categories are very uncomfortable for most since they tend to hire out of state counselors because they have no choice but to stay the entire camp.
