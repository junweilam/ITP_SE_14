There was a 6-month honeymoon in which everything seemed great. The benefits of the offered were extraordinary expensive and definitely not affordable on the salary paid. I paid a quarter of my salary every paycheck to get benefits that barely covered anything I needed to have done The management hired by the corporation was ill-equipped to handle the job. All the leadership that was done was belittling and could considered a type of bullying. Promotions were given to people with less or no experience . People that were promoted to leadership roles had no training on how to lead. People were hired because they would work for cheap, not because of their skills. Employees were treated like commodities, not like people. The workplace was not toxic prior to being purchased by the corporation but quickly became so. Certain people in the hospital became quick targets and Were made to feel unwanted and stupid. The hourly wage that was paid was extremely low, especially considering the experience of some of the people that work there. Amount of pay time off provided was ridiculously low. Numerous times that I know of, the behavior of the management was reported to the corporate office and nothing was ever done about it."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Ungrateful and uncaring to employees.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Veterinary Assistant in Mobile, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are none.
