This is far and away the worst experience I have ever had. I was the Director of their PACE program and led a team of approximately fifty employees. The organization forces people to pray before every meeting. They force salaried employees to \"volunteer\" at their functions and coerce staff to donate to the organization via payroll deductions. For me, the most horrendous (and very telling) experince was having the Executive Director stand at the entryway of the annual Christmas Party and make employees go and wash their hands before entering the party. I was recently forced to \"volunteer\" at their annual LUV Gala where, I noticed, donors and attendees were not forced to visit the restroom prior to entering the the event. Staff \"volunteers\" were relegated to a dingy room where they had a buffet of cold past and some sloppy already-dressed wilting salad. I felt like the maid in Downton Abbey. Aside from the twenty-minute break we were given, most \"volunteers\" were forced to stand for five hours.\r\n\r\nBenefits are horrible. There is very little choice for medical insurance - two HMOs, Kaiser and Sharp, where the provider is the same as the insurance company. Whe kind of care does one get when the insurance company paying controls the doctors. Yes, terrible health care. Leave time consists of seventeen days per year TOTAL - to be used for holidays, personal, sick, or vacation - so basically the ten holidays everyone gets off plus seven more days of sick, personal, and vacation combined. I can't tell you difficult it was to attract decent staff when the benefits are so paltry.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, I feel like the care this organization provides to the elderly community they are supposed to be serving is horrible. Everything is based around money money money for the organization so benefits the elderly residents are supposed to be receiving are not given. I think an interesting point is the fact that this is supposed to a non-profit organization but I noticed that, whenever I have to order or purchase anything, we pay taxes. Non-profit organization are tax exempt so I have always felt like something fishy is going on - like they are lying to their donors. I asked about this almost as soon as I started working there but got hushed up that and every other time I asked.\r\n\r\nBecause St. Paul's is such a horrible place to work, the only staff who stay on for any length of time are pretty lacking - again, only obsequeious lackeys stay on and/or move up in this organization. There is very little real leadership because of this. The Executive Director of the organization and the Executive Director of PACE sit in their respective offices all day with their doors closed. They are completely inaccessible to staff and totally out of touch with what actually goes on in the organization.\r\n\r\nI cannot possible stress enough how awful my experience with this place has been.
