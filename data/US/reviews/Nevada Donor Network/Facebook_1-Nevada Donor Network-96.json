Just before we lost everything another Donor center merged with us and saved our jobs inspite of the incompetence of the Director and management. At that point management started laying off all the highly competent Technicians. One technician was let go after refusing to do a case which he felt was not an acceptable one to do. The Director pushed for income over well being of the people we were supposed to be helping. Within a year I recieved a few promotions and several raises but was abruptly let go for not returning a page which is entirely not true. I was told by one manager that they were paying me too much since my wife and I purchased a home and two new vehicles that year.
