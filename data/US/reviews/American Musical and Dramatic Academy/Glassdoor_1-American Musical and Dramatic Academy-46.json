Few have worked in higher education before and some do not hold even a Bachelor's degree. Their lack of understanding of how to efficiently operate an academic institution trickles down into every facet. Departments are understaffed, underpaid, and crammed into office spaces that are way over capacity.\r\n\r\nTuition is also sky high, but the money is not used to adequately support students or faculty. Only a handful of faculty have offices and administrative support is practically non-existent. There are no tenure track positions and faculty are sometimes not rehired without explanation. Some are hired last minute (even after classes have begun) and are assigned classes they're not qualified to teach.

Initially, they bent over backward to make me feel welcome: my own office, brand new amenities, everyone stopping in to say hello, etc. I thought I\u2019d won the lottery, as the salary and benefits were quite solid, as well. \r\n\r\nThen, cracks started to show on the surface. The entire organization runs around the mercurial personality of the head of the school, and her minions. Please take that final word of the preceding sentence seriously. After my first meeting with the school\u2019s head and said acolytes, I knew I was in trouble. In short, if you\u2019re not willing to play the irrational games and buy into the very cult-like (not to mention very prudish) culture, you will soon find yourself on the outs. \r\n\r\nIn addition, many of the top executive/managerial positions are held not by people experienced in business, administration or leadership, but failed actors, dancers and musicians who are AMDA alumni. You might be an experienced professional with over 20 years in the field of business management, for example, but find a 30 year-old ex-dancer supervising and micromanaging your every move. The head of the school is rarely there, and when she is, she\u2019ll swoop in and demand irrational things that undermine all the work you\u2019ve put in. She also demonstrates no actual ability as a leader or administrator and is shockingly prudish, more akin to a middle school librarian from the Midwest than head of progressive-minded performing arts school. As a result, people avoid her and most of the people in upper management like the plague, resulting in a complete communication breakdown among the levels of leadership, which makes it impossible to get anything substantive done. \r\n\r\nAfter a month on the job, during which time I not only completed all the work they said they needed done during the fall semester (with only stellar feedback on my performance, I might add), I was let go, with no explanation, other than \u201cIt\u2019s not working out.\u201d I\u2019ll add that I was called into HR to receive my walking papers twenty minutes after filing my last project. \r\n\r\nLater, I was told by several of my former colleagues that this was actually a contract gig, as opposed to a full-time position, and this is AMDA\u2019s usual M.O.: they hire a seasoned professional to whom they assign the jobs that require heavy lifting, then let them go once that\u2019s done, so the people who are lower on the ladder can dot the I\u2019s and cross the t\u2019s, thus saving them money. Apparently in both their NY and LA locations, they've earned the nickname SCAMDA, in spades, due to this and other things.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, I met some nice people while I was there, all of whom seemed like they\u2019d had all the life and stuffing knocked out of them by the oppressive culture that AMDA submerges you in. I hope they\u2019re all able to move onto greener pastures. \r\n\r\nIn short, if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s \u201cgo with the flow,\u201d and know how to adapt yourself to any environment, who can \u201cbe who others want you to be,\u201d this might actually be a good fit for you. If, however, you\u2019re a strong, type-A personality who\u2019s used to having a degree of autonomy both personally and professionally, speaking your mind, and not having to knuckle under to \u201csuperiors\u201d who, quite frankly, if it weren\u2019t for the title by their names, not only wouldn\u2019t be your superiors, but would most likely be serving you coffee somewhere, AVOID AMDA AT ALL COSTS."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sounds too good to be true, it is.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Jan 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company does offer an amazing opportunity to its students looking to get an education in performing arts.", "cons": "Staff of faculty consider your self  disposable, untrustworthy, and devalued regardless of expertise.
