And when it works, it works. The caveat to that is you have to have proper staffing for it to work. If there isn't enough staff, you will have to cover therapy up to 40 hours per week. It got so bad that they ended up making a policy to where CAs HAVE to cover at least 16 hours per WEEK, when it used to be that they couldn't pull you onto the floor for more than 16 hours per MONTH. While covering therapy isn't the end of the world, it can become extremely frustrating when you are trying to earn your supervision hours. The board requires that you earn 60% unrestricted (behavior plans, treatment plans, monthly goals, anything BCBAs do, etc.), which you cannot feasibly do if you're on the floor a lot. This also reduces clinical staff support. I appreciate the experience overall, but having to cover therapy so much definitely dampened my experience.\n\nAdvice for prospective applicants: If you are looking in to dipping your toes into the field of ABA, this is a standard opportunity to do so.
