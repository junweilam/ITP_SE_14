You will have to handhold them through every step (some are older and don't get any sort of technology) and when you try to teach them they will just tell you, \"that's your job to do it for me.\" I built a simple spreadsheet to help track priority and one recruiter told me that she, \"does not do or understand spreadsheets and won't be using it.\" \r\n- Everything is just... slow. Want a job approved, maybe in 2 weeks. Want a description approved, 2 weeks. Need someone to finalize the approval process, another week.

USC has better schools and accepts stronger students and the Upstate has much better facilities, doctors and patient reviews. Look it up. Unless they stop hiring more-of-the-same leadership, the institution will continue to sink.", "cons": "Leasership without any university experience and Board of trustees that purposely closes out the community and kicking out all strong female leadership = poorly run institution.  \r\nThe amount employees spend on health benefits is insane, especially since you work at a hospital!!  In fact, you will likely pay more than someone working outside of heathcare and you are basically forced to see MUSC drs or pay even more!\r\nWhen the city floods- you are still expected to drive to work. Lord help you if you have a low riding car, because at some point, you will stall and possibly float on some of the roads around MUSC.  Right after you pay high rates for your parking.

Parking is a hassle but better than it used to be.  There still are waiting lists for decent parking which take a few months and then you have to pay for parking, $30-50 a month depending on which lot. \r\n\r\nYou also have to use your PTO to take off for holidays, which is fine for clinical staff that doesn't work a regular 8 to 5 schedule, but for those of us who work office hours, you have to use your PTO, so even though they say you get 23 days of vacation a year, you have to use your PTO for holidays, so in reality you only get 11 days of vacation per year and you have to use that for sick time as well.  \r\n\r\nAlso, they don't tell you this until you're hired but you HAVE to contribute at least 6% of your salary to the retirement plan so keep that in mind during salary negotiations.\r\n\r\nAnother thing they are rather deceitful about is their dental plans.

However, when I went to my dentist, she told me I would have to pay $80 out of pocket just for a cleaning!!! On top of that, you can\u2019t change dental plans for two years, so you\u2019re locked into a crappy dental plan for two years.\r\n\r\nYes, the Basic Plan is free to employees, however since it doesn\u2019t even cover cleanings, it\u2019s a waste.

I cannot speak to the hiring practices of upper administration and other fields, so I am sticking with that I know best.  We spend big bucks and lots of time to find the right candidate for the job. This is a concerted effort made by faculty and staff and it is taken very seriously. Sometimes, people get close to taking us up on a job offer and then vanish at the last minute because they got a better offer; they were holding out for a promotion where they were; or the trailing spouse nixed the deal. We are experienced in this type of disappointment and we endeavor to learn from it and improve the next candidate search.  Also, MUSC hires people with diverse backgrounds if possible. For example, we hired a theater major to do project development. He was fantastic, putting his skills to work in a novel way. So, I would say that MUSC does not use a cookie-cutter approach to hiring.\r\nThe location of MUSC is a draw. Situated on the Charleston peninsula, MUSC is the largest edifice in the city. It is visible from the bridges that take you into downtown, which makes a lovely scene as you drive to work. Arial shots of the MUSC complex always impress as the harbor water and the marina set a nautical tone while the brick buildings convey a business theme. \r\nMuch of the downtown area around MUSC is original, meaning that the sidewalks George Washington walked over are still in there, buckled and broken, but charming in their historic appeal. MUSC works to maintain the historic aspect of its campus by replacing any brick or stone work that must be temporarily moved for new buildings and growth. We also are masterful at restoring old buildings and using them again. Breathtaking is the new College of Health Professions which is a renovated Charleston High School. It is worth viewing just for the majesty of this space.  In fact, at Christmas, I use this building's lobby for my family holiday photos...it is that gorgeous. \r\nAs faculty, at MUSC, you are basically left alone. This is ideal. You cannot do your best work under micromanaging scrutiny and stifling meddling. Happily, at MUSC, you are independent and left to your own creativity to get the job done.  \r\nMUSC is innovative in that it posts a rumor mill on the intranet for faculty and staff. This allows us to read what others are thinking and learn about what is going on that we might not investigate on our own. This is good and promotes transparency in administration. Often the answers are pat and reiterative of policy, which does not address the question submitted, but now and then a really good and informative answer surprises me and I learn from this web offering. \r\nOur cafeteria is getting an overhaul, and it was already pretty good. The salad bar is great and they are always experimenting with new ideas. We also have a farmers market that comes to us on Fridays. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? This is part of our healthy programs for employees, and it is a smash. I cheaply replenish my vegetable drawer in the fridge every Friday because of this opportunity, which benefits local businesses and farms. \r\nBecause we are on the water, the graduate school often charters a huge boat to pilot around the harbor for a few hours at the beginning of the school year. This is a unique aspect of MUSC. \r\nWe are near the College of Charleston, so we can collaborate with their faculty on ideas. Generally, we are encouraged to do this, and it makes for interesting work.", "cons": "As much as I am pleased with the independence and historic charm of MUSC and this area, there are a few drawbacks I wish I had known about earlier. First, there is little parking available, and many people have been on decades' long wait lists for parking spaces in adjacent garages. New garages should alleviate this issue in the future, while new buildings often cause parking areas to be closed for many months at a time. \r\nI wish that MUSC had insurance and health care coverage more like other medical universities in which faculty and their family receive free care by their employer's health care providers. I received this at my previous medical university job and it was a siginificant benefit for us. I felt very valued as an employee in this regard. \r\nMUSC does not offer this to faculty. Also, unfortunately, health care plans that MUSC once had are no longer available and the worst choice is the state health plan which covers very little although the premiums are mandated and taken from the paycheck. Through a disturbing calculus, the state plan covers not much, but what you pay for the care does not go to the deductible or the out-of-pocket...which is suprising and depressing to people who have not been told this by HR. Thus, I would say that there is not sufficient accuracy and transparency with the health plans offered. \r\nOther drawbacks might be that HR is very hard to reach...you can call the entire HR directory and no one will answer the phone. This occurs many times a week , and people DO complain. HR is trying to fix this. \r\nRecently, we had the unfortunate experience of furloughing faculty who were not the highest earners in the university. This was troubling because faculty making substantial salaries were not furloughed, confusing many and lowering morale for those who were lower wage earners and could therefore not comfortably afford 4 months worth of mandatory paycheck deductions. Many people thought that the budget crises would have been faster solved by furloughing the highest earners instead of selectively penalizing only a handful (1,500) of people who were struggling with money matters. The budget seems to be back on track at this time, so maybe this will be a bad memory for us very soon...and not repeated.\r\nI often feel discouraged about the reporting system at MUSC when a problem needs to be solved. Like every other workplace on the planet, we have people who like the paycheck but not the work to earn it, and they don't do their due diligence at work. Because of the convoluted reporting system and hiring structure, it is impossible to remove low performers. We recently embarked on several new policies (MUSC Excellence and new contracts for faculty) that should speed up this aspect of MUSC (incompetence in the workplace) but we have not seen results at this time. \r\nI don't want to go on and on about drawbacks because ultimately, you can forge your own path at MUSC. If you have an idea, you can run with it and you can develop your goals with lots of freedom. This type of academic freedom will help you divert your attention from the cons and focus on the plusses of MUSC and it can also help you change your environment. Go-getters and doggedly determined faculty tend to rise above the fray and set their own pathways."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "OK, some major issues", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jun 2016", "job_title": "Accountant/Financial Analyst I in Charleston, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "only need to work 40 hrs per week. good work life balance. lots of time off, sick day and holidays.", "cons": "management plays favorites based on looks rather than skills. management only cares about what the auditors say. as long as the auditors don't find anything they are happy even though the audits are an absolute joke. our office is just wait for our department to implode in a big way due to management incompetence."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Anaylst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Systems Analyst in Charleston, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "MUSC has a high reputation in the community.
