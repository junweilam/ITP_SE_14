Vanderbilt trails the private sector and other academic institutions in many categories (pay, benefits, perks, technology, strategy). Benefits are touted as outstanding, but they aren\u2019t. The tuition benefit is laughable, up to 70% reimbursement per class per semester. Good luck if you are on a reasonable track. Pay lags both higher education and private sector, and you\u2019ll be doing the job of two people as Vanderbilt runs lean (assuming all of the pay is being funneled to the executive leaders who are paid quite well, which you can find online). \r\n\r\nAs others have stated, promotions are based on popularity as metrics and objective measuring points are non-existent. Unfortunately, the University does a great job of conducting layoffs; it seems every department is constantly being reorganized, and leadership turnover occurs often. The only constant at Vanderbilt is change. One of these departments is HR, which lacks adequate, consistent leadership and has for the past few years; we are now on our fourth CHRO in a few years (and they\u2019re still trying to figure out how to support the institution effectively). There has also been significant turnover in the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion space, even though Vanderbilt believes they thought leaders. \r\n\r\nWhen working here, I always feel caught in the \u201ctides\u201d of Vanderbilt University\u2019s political views and initiatives (you can fact check by looking at who they donate to for political races). If you don\u2019t fit the Vanderbilt mold, you will be singled out. It also seems there are cases where hiring is made on visual appearances rather than experience, education, and credentials in the pursuit of \u201cdiversity.\u201d"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great environment\r\nGreat benefits\r\nAcademic schedule, generous breaks", "cons": "Lower pay than most competitors\r\nTraffic around West End is bad most days"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Research Assistant I in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "22 days of PTO a year, Good retirement, Healthcare, and good people!", "cons": "Pay compared to cost of living..."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place for curious minds", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wide range of research with highly collaborative environment", "cons": "Quality of research can sometimes slow the pace of publication"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Gread Research Experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great research experience with excellent research facilities.", "cons": "No Cons as such to point out"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Generally Nice Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Researcher, PhD Candidate in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nashville is a nice city that has many things you would expect out of a larger city (sports teams, symphony, etc)\r\n\r\nVanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University Medical Center are very close to each other", "cons": "Vanderbilt dominates most industries (especially science/research) in Nashville"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Program Coordinator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Program Coordinator in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility, Growth Opportunities, Breaks, Diversity.", "cons": "I do not have any, I enjoy my work."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Top-heavy, inefficient, top-down", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Jun 2021", "job_title": "PhD Researcher in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, collaborative environment, great medical center access.
