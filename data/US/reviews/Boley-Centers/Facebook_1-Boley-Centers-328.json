If HR needs something they don't send you an email or use inter office mail or call you, they send mail to your house, which is very inefficient. It also takes HR so long to go through the process of the background check and getting all of their paperwork together, it will easily be at least a month, probably closer to two to actually start working once you've submitted your application. You never see your house supervisor and get average reviews because they never see the work you do. The company claims to have a 75% success rate in treating addiction, when anyone who has ever worked in addiction knows that is impossible and untrue. There are also no raises ever. The training is maybe a few days of on the job training before you are thrown to the wolves. If you're lucky you will work in a facility that has two staff working at a time, if not, you will be by yourself completely."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "This is not a company you want to get excited about working for", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Dec 2012", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Somewhere to get in the door if you are interested in working for a not for profit that does similar things in the community", "cons": "Not well organized\r\nManagement practically non existent\r\nInterest exists to make money over serving client"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good intro to mental health services", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Behavioral Health Technician", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They provide needed housing services for an underserved population in St. Pete which could result in fulfilling work.", "cons": "Low pay and high drama in the office environment at times.
