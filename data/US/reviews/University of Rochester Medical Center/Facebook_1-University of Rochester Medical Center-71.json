I came to the hospital with experience, really good post surgical experience from a busy busy hospital, let\u2019s just say charge nurse would have 7 patients, day shift\u2026wild I know, but that was the case. Honestly I was well prepared to advance on my skill set at this hospital. When I started on oncology and had worked there for a full year. I was the only black nurse. New grad white nurses would come & would soon be offered & trained to be charge. I was overlooked & never offered to train for charge in that unit. Basically never the opportunity for advancement for a black nurse as myself- this made me question my loyalty to the organization & if I wanted to stay with the hospital. There were a few staff that were passive aggressive & never included me in anything, including learning. It felt lonely working here. I switched to the CVICU\u2026this was even worse- there was no black nurse there & no black tech (they had LPNs as techs). See I possibly got the opportunity because my name doesn\u2019t come across as black/ it\u2019s British so it\u2019s never until someone sees me that they realize \u201coh she\u2019s black\u201d. Anyway, I wasn\u2019t even given the opportunity to complete my orientation\u2026my preceptor felt that I was so bad that the brand new grad nurses (white) were better and could stay so not only was I dealing with a preceptor creating a hostile work environment for me & yelling at me infront of patients & colleagues, my preceptorship was escalated to another staff another white manager lady who never even said hello to me (passive aggressive) & precepted me for one day\u2026.ONE DAY & told me that I was going to be walked off the unit the next day. With this aggressive yet subtle knowledge she shared, basically, I drafted my resignation letter & resigned that next day. I ended up taking travel opportunities & manager\u2019s at these other top institutions thought I was so great that they always extended my contract & even offered me perm staff positions. & I now work as a staff at the nation\u2019s top hospitals with true diversity & inclusion from doctors to nurses to management. & I can see how this has strengthened ability to stay with a hospital. If you look at some of the great orgs like NYU, Weill Cornell, NYP, Columbia, United Nations\u2026one thing they share in common is there strengths in diversity & inclusion. This can be a great hospital if it can actually implement diversity & inclusion across all units & levels\u2026& not just talk about it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business
