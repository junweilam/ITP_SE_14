The liberal arts building is a nice place to teach with modern facilities and excellent classroom technology. It's a little anemic and characterless, but they are going for something somewhat minimalist. (One of the rooms was used as the room for when Frank Underwood from House of Cards was shot and in hospital. They filmed some of the episodes there over the summer. Unfortunately I didn't run into Claire or Frank. It is somewhat telling that you can take a classroom and pass it off as a hospital room). The student body is diverse and interesting coming generally from the greater Baltimore area and surrounding counties.",
            "cons": "As a lecturer with no other departmental responsibilities I was somewhat isolated from the rest of the staff. This was in part a result of my own choices but I was never actively invited to participate in the life of the department beyond the public events the department put on. This is reflected, to a degree, in the institutional status of non-tenure track faculty. Even as a full-time lecturer teaching a 4-4 load, I had the status of \"contingent faculty\" in the university system. This meant, for example, I couldn't have the fee for parking deducted from my monthly paycheck, it had to be taken out in three lump sums. This was tough at the start of the semester when you are already strapped having not been paid over the summer. (You are paid ten months of the year as a lecturer). This is connected to another issue: parking. The tenured faculty I knew lived somewhat nearby and opted not to drive. This wasn't an option for me so I had to pay for parking which rose to around $400 for the year. Towson is a commuter campus with way more students and cars then parking spaces. Students often complain about the expense of parking on campus."
