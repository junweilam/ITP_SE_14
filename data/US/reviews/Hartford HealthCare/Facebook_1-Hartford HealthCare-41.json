You gain about 7.35 hours of PTO per pay period which is not even enough for a full day off and apparently they \"increased it\" to an amount that \"covers you\" for the Holiday's and such when the office is closed.  I started in October and did not have enough PTO for the holiday's and this ended up counting against me.\r\n2)  Our department spent more time updating our Standard of Work book than actually working.  Our Standard Work would literally change twice a week at minimum and more and more work was being dumped on us at the same time.\r\n3)  The supervisor and manager were terrible micro-managers.\r\n4)  If you are (un)lucky enough to get on a Performance Improvement Plan, good luck to you, because they do not help you out at all.  They will monitor your work with a fine tooth comb and your managers will be the first to bring up how you are still failing, all without TRYING to help make work better.\r\n5)  HHC have these Leadership Behaviors that they make you \"live by\" but they do not even do it themselves.  From personal experience, if you have a \"Courageous Conversation\" be prepared to pay the consequences! Once you speak up they will do all they can to make your life hell and try to force you out.\r\n6)  Management does not listen to their employees at all.  Morale is awful in multiple departments and nothing was being done.  Instead, more and more people were quitting and leaving for better employers.\r\n7)  One of the most frustrating part about HHC is that our Department Director even stated that \"if you are unhappy in your role, just come talk to me and we will find a better fit.\"  This was all just a game they were playing to make it sound like they really did care but they don't.  Look back up to # 5.  If you speak up they will find a way to get rid of you as fast as they can.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll in all I had a very unpleasant experience.  For such a huge organization it really felt like all they want is money, money, money and the employees are the ones that get screwed.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from Hartford Healthcare.  Look at Yale New Haven Health or even Middlesex Health for better options!

Management was more concerned about how fast you answered a phone than how you actually dealt with retirees and current employees retirement questions/ cases. It didn't matter to them how in depth a persons issue or case was, all they cared about was how fast cases were closed, phone answering speeds, and their ratings. Because employees were forced to care more about speed, small details were continually missed and extra stress was put on most people working there. Instead of taking the time to do things correctly, the departments of life cycle, retirement, and benefits were constantly doing clean up projects, onto of their own department work, for upper managements mistakes and carelessness. The office setting was miserable because of the understaffing, constant unrealistic goals set, and unwillingness to change the way cases were approached. In my time there, there was constant turnover of employees. Instead of replacing these employees they would hire temps with little to no experience in HR and expect them to be seasoned Vets within days. When I was hired it took two weeks to gain access to the computer systems. I saw this happen for a few other temps hired in my 8 months there. Lastly, they promise their temps that the jobs are temp-to-hire. I was told positions would be available in 2-3 months from my hire. I would check bi-weekly with my boss on possible openings until I was told by email that the budget wouldn't allow for any unless someone left. That is not okay to lie to employees during the interview process and is why two other employees left around the same time I did. There is no honesty from management and the separation it creates from their workers is truly what made this place unbearable to work at. \r\n\r\nOne last Example: my head boss did not know how to use our main system (peoplesoft) and seemed to have no desire to even try to learn it"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Medical Technology", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "29 Apr 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Hartford, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Few.......
