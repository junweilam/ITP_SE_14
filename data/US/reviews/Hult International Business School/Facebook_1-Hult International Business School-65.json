I only lasted a month here and I knew right from the interview that it was going to be a toxic work environment but I needed money so I could hold out for a better offer. Heres my experience. I worked in their tech department and there was so much gross negligence surrounding security and hazards just one misstep away from causing a fire that it was a wonder that the building was still standing. Speaking of the building, the meeting rooms are poorly made and have no privacy. You could easily hear conversations from every room and I once heard a person reciting their credit card information despite them WHISPERING. The facilities ( theyre are 3 in total ) give off the VENEER of a well-maintained business but the foundation shows how cheaply made and hazardous it is. Which I find to be a symbolic representation of its staff. They present well but are just rotten and prejudiced. None of the staff are qualified to be teaching and the company itself is a scam which is why the student demographic consists of immigrants because they are unfortunately one the most vulnerable demographic in the US suspectible to finance scams and least likely to get retribution for it due to some,if not most of them not holding US citizen status. So deplorable. and the old dust bags in the executive board know this and are just waiting the days away so they can retire with the money they have garnered by feeding these poor students the false promises of a better future. If you are a black person or BIPOC that knows your worth you will be harassed and bullied high school courtyard style to be pushed out to quit so that you cant be fired. And you will be gaslit by other members within the different teams to have them join in on it so you can believe youre doing something wrong when the reality of it is. is that youre not with putting up a charade that white is right and acting inferior to your white colleagues. The tech team is highly prejudiced with how they provide support. they cater to the white staff and students first and treat the BIPOCs as an afterthought. The head of the tech team is super creepy and NO ONE like them and simply tolerates them because of their position. Theyre a coward who will work remotely just to avoid their responsibilities onsite and simply have their other white colleague handle it in their place. So sad. Im glad i got out on my own terms when i did and get this they tried to short me on my last check but luckily i took screenshots of all the time i worked and work I did to rightfully threaten them with a lawsuit if they didnt give me what they owed. so make sure you keep a paper trail of all of your work.

But make no mistake - you are entirely replaceable and your unique skills and attributes do not matter to senior leadership. \r\n\r\nIf you are considering Hult, always remember that interviews are a 2-way street. You are evaluating Hult as much as they are evaluating you. Ask hard questions and ensure you get the answers you need. If you come across this review and my words give you pause - good.

Change Management is an absolute joke and they truly don't care if people stay or leave.  Since I gave my notice, there have been almost ten others who have, as well.  There is HUGE pressure around 'student satisfaction' surveys that have no qualitative information in them, and there is no data to support why students scores go up or down.

The management has no idea what its doing from a day to day basis. Central leadership is on a different campus, and they seem to almost purposefully hire people  who have no business being in that position. No leadership skills, no concept of how changes affect their staff (probably because staff doesnt stay around long enough to actually have an opinion). No position comes with a job description or training. They say things like \"no plan is the plan!\" as a cute way to excuse themselves from taking responsibility for their bad ideas, or the effects their bad ideas have on the brand, students, faculty and staff. The simultaneously claim to be a start up - but then will say they have been around since the 60's. The School and its parent company, EF, seem to be in the real estate business with a side hustle of being a visa mill. The \"standards\" for the entrance process is practically non existent, as they are focused on sales, not standards. At least 20% of the students at any given time are grossly unqualified to be at the school, but they all seem to be rich enough to afford the school. In most cases these students do a semester or two and then transfer to another school after getting grossly inflated grades.\r\n\r\nThe school and EF will send out emails offering a discount on $4000 dollar EF branded racing bikes (they own a racing team) while paying their staff criminally low wages in a city like Boston. At the same time during yearly staff meetings they will tell us sheepishly, that no one is getting a raise, but that they have also devoted $10million dollars to adding better bedroom for the 10 people who sign up for the executive education class. They send their sales staff (not admissions, not enrollment, SALES, because that is what they do) on \"kick off\" trips multiple times a year. When the grossly unqualified sales staff then fails to deliver the next barrel of chum - the rest of the schools employees will get no raises.\r\n\r\nSo, you could crush it all year, be the model worker, do more than you were asked, meet and exceed your yearly goals, and they will tell you that you arent getting a raise. So if the cost of living increases, and your wages dont...you just took a pay cut.\r\n\r\nHave an issue? Talk to HR! Oh wait. They dont have and HR department. They have a single person who lives in Europe who responds to you by saying \"Talk to your manager\" because she doesnt believe in an HR department. Literally the Scott Pruitt of the HR world. There are no trainings, there is no guidance, there are not KPIs or metrics for success, there is no support. You are on your own\r\n\r\nIf you are going to work here - never get comfortable. Use it as a hold over for something better. This place will never actually invest in you. Lots of promises that will never be delivered, simply because they cant do that. You can be \"Hult\" Successful, by sitting at your desk and routinely announcing to the rest of the office \"how busy you are\" and \"how much work your doing\" and how you have to \"launch an exam\", but not actually really do anything of merit. You can be terrible at your job and no one will care, they just want the illusion that things are working, they dont really care because they have no idea what your job or responsibilities are.\r\n\r\nWhen you see problems and try and fix them, they will tell you not to, because that would draw attention to the fact that there is an issue. \r\n\r\nDont work here, you are definitely are worth more at any other position, at any other location. They average pay difference at any other institution in Boston is about $10-15,000 more, with better benefits, access to free education, time off and a more respectful, nurturing environment. If you are desperate. Sure, take the job, but you should immediately be planning to move on, because they will will never offer you anything but the minimum. This school could, and should, be a better place to work, but they dont care enough to do that...because they are a real estate company, with a side order of a visa mill, moonlighting as an education COMPANY, not school, lead by a gaggle of unqualified business people who live in a different country, speak in an echo chamber and lag 10-15 years behind the competition but think they are on the cutting edge.
