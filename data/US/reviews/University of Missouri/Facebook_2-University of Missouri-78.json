You get good vibes working with the kids and planning your specific site and that sucks you into stay then at the office it is horrible. You must look and act a certain way to get ahead and at that there is little to no advancement. Borders on racist and transphobic. Not forward thinking when it comes to tuition. At a time when Adventure Club is hurting for families and kids, they raised rates when they really should lower rates to pack kids in there. Take all kids regardless of their SES. They take state aid for a limited number of kids and have a meager scholarship program. I gave a forward thinking idea to upper management about lowering rates by half thereby getting a higher enrollment but was quickly shot down. I understand a difference of opinion but these are kids needing care. \n\nTo all these reasons Adventure Club is not living up to their mission statement of, \"enhancing the growth and development of the children, families, staff, and communities we serve.\" Or is that a lie?"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great place for student workers", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Graphic Designer in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible scheduling, great job experience", "cons": "Smaller hourly wage compared to other employers"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great opportunity", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Executive Assistant in Columbia, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Reviews jobs and gets pay to be competitive.", "cons": "Low staff count on job duties."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Columbia, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work as student", "cons": "Not much I can complain about"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Support Specialist", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Business Support Specialist in Columbia, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "wide range of jobs available and room for growth", "cons": "very corporate feeling, and very big"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Variable, Depends on Degree Sought After", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Columbia, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tuition and fees are covered.", "cons": "Monthly stipend pay cannot account for frequent 60+ hour work week, though this is towards completing degree granting projects."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Day at Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Columbia, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The environment is fast paced which is something I personally like.
