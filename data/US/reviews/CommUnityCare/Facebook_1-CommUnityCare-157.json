For example, a new attendance policy was finally put in to place. The manager and supervisor insisted that the therapists get their patients to sign the paper even though that takes away from patient care time and is typically an administrative/ front desk duty. -Prior to 6 or 7 therapists going to HR, management did not enforce parents of children receiving therapy to stay on the premises.

Working with these employees was my favorite part about working at CommUnityCare\r\n\r\nWork-life balance is great if you're a salary employee out of the corporate office.", "cons": "Some former reviews said the following, that I can verify with my experience:\r\n\r\n--\"Huge disparity between the senior leadership team, and the \"worker bees\" and the staff changes in senior leadership have not been for the better. They seem to have lost our mission and are just seeking money now.\"\r\n\r\n--\"The high level employees at the admin office get the nice equipment, big salaries and praise, while those doing the actual work often go unnoticed. (I was in the admin building)\"\r\n\r\n--\"Senior management was entrenched in itself.\"\r\n\r\n-\"Cares more about numbers then patients, does not care about employees, does not give necessary time and or equipment for one to do their job efficiently, high turn over especially with Medical Assistants and Care Coordinators, unorganized, takes on to many projects with out the staffing or funds which overloads existing employees, managers are not concerned with staff needs.\"\r\n\r\nI can verify all of these statements. Hierarchical disparity was one of my biggest issues working at CommUnityCare. My role was involved in improving the clinical processes and experience of clinic staff. When presenting the feedback I received from the clinics to management (not enough staff, not the right equipment, etc), I was told explicitly, \"all they do is complain\" As if the clinic didn't have reasonable concerns. I was pushed to only focus on metrics for testing in order to create more favorable outcomes for funding. \r\n\r\nThe chain of command is completely broken. My manager didn't take findings and present them accurately to senior management, rather they manipulated the data to present a false reality. That's part of the reason why senior management is completely out of touch. Mid level mangers are only looking out for themselves. Not to mention that managers take credit for others' ideas, leaving employees without a believable record for any chance of moving up in the company. There's a reason why the admin building is informally referred to as the \"death star\".\r\n\r\nOrganizational strategy projects were completely disorganized. Employees are thrown into panicked, rushed projects that overload them. Plus, some of the projects competed with other initiatives the employees were already working on. There is no coordinated insight on the bigger picture of work being done, leaving people being dragged into multiple meetings talking about the exact same things (myself aside, I noticed this more with my colleagues and felt bad for them).\r\n\r\n--\"No opportunity for advancement as a physician. Physicians or mid level providers with little to no experience are placed into leadership positions or advanced without the positions being offered to more experienced providers.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with this statement as well. I was proud and honored to work with very intelligent/enthusiastic providers, but they seemed to become quickly discouraged by confusing metrics and policies. While they seem up to the task being on high visibility projects, I can understand it can be frustrating to see experienced providers being put on the back burner.\r\n\r\n-\" Incompetant HR systems, politics,\"\r\n\r\n-\"Favoritism.Brown nosing. HR department all have really big heads.\"\r\n\r\nIf an issue arises within your working experience and you feel the need to go to HR, don't. They defend the poor behavior of their managers. This is another example on how this organization never takes complaints seriously and just blames the employee for their own misfortune.\r\n\r\n-\"understand that turnover is bad because of poor leadership from the individual clinics on up.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bit alarming during orientation that the trainer said at the beginning of day 2, \"We know that you have your choices in healthcare systems, and we are glad that you came back today\" This alerted me that there is a big turnover problem, and it seems that the organization anticipates unhappy clinic employees. I asked my manager that same day about any turnover issues, and I was told that it's not really a big problem. Apparently they screwed up pay for hourly clinic employees. At first, they weren't paying people very well at all, then increased wages to be more competitive in Austin. However, they failed to match that increase for existing employees, leaving some staff that were there for a much longer period of time earning less than new hires. Therefore, people with more experience at the company weren't being compensated fairly.\r\n\r\nWithin my department, a respected and experienced director who interviewed me resigned a week before I started (he was part of the reason why I accepted the job). Another talented manager left a week after I started. There is toxicity and incompetence and it leaves good employees stuck at sea with idiots and they end up leaving. A lot of people who have also accepted jobs in my role left within a year of working at CommUnityCare.\r\n\r\nMy boss touted themselves as being data talented and driven, but in reality had no idea how to interpret data. Once I realized that I was blamed for being incompetent or wrong because I presented data with \"bad news\" or \"bad numbers\" (reflecting reality), I realized that I needed to manipulate data to show them the story they wanted to hear, just so I could avoid personal critique. The fantasy data I presented made them so happy and I was told, \"this is the most in-depth data analysis that you have done so far\". They're a total moron and didn't realize that the data was a lie. Plus, they completely ignored professional feedback from doctors with improvements and metrics for tracking success.\r\n\r\nCommUnityCare also made poor business decisions: such as buying out run down clinics rather than using that money to give more resources (people/equipment) to their existing clinics."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Care Giver", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Care Giver in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Helping my clients to be able to do what they were unable to do because of a sickness and/or because of them aging.", "cons": "It just wasn't enough hours in the day to service every client, because some of them I was all they had.
