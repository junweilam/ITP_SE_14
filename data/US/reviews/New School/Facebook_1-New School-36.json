Across the board, The New School is insanely top heavy: people in ridiculously high paying roles (who have been there 7+ years, sometimes longer) doing nothing but making decks and babysitting leadership. If you're under 35, good luck getting anyone to take you seriously\u2014for a project, raise, or a higher position\u2014particularly if you're challenging folks to actually live by the progressive ideals of the institution. I wasn't the only young, energetic person who experienced a kind of slow, sad suffocation\u2014constantly asked to do more and more of the wrong kind of work and discouraged from taking on the real issues (faculty dissatisfaction; overly paid higher ups while worker bee staff members beg for $60K a year; reliance on adjuncts so they don't have to pay for health insurance; overworked/underpaid grad students; students angry because they can barely afford to eat with the high tuition and even higher turnover rate of advisors because advisors, being underpaid and overworked, frequently quit before students can even get to know them, let alone ask for their advice). If you're looking for something with all the pros I mentioned and you don't have too many growth aspirations or mind an e-mail-heavy, Yale-graduate Boomer-dominated culture, apply."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Stay out of New School", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Adjunct Faculty Member in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is located in New York City and there is a lot to do off campus.", "cons": "The administration tries hard to get rid of adjunct faculty who either up for six year contracts, which give them some job protection, and long-term adjunct faculty, who have a lot of job protection and are making more money."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good but isolated", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great environment, great faculty, dynamic environment", "cons": "Everyone is doing their own thing, lack of community"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Flagstaff", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Sales Manager in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A good place to work with a diverse team", "cons": "Not much growth with the type of customers"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Phenomenal Institution", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Assistant Events Coordinator in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Phenomenal institution to work for.
