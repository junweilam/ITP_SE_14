There is simply not enough labor to get the work done correctly and on time. Technical systems are outdated and/or not set up properly, in part due to rapid decisions and short timelines from senior leadership, and in part because staff turnover is so high that so much institutional and technical knowledge has been lost. Faculty do not treat support staff well. It is common to be belittled, yelled at, and mobbed and to watch this happen to your colleagues as well but not being able to do anything. It is especially bad for female staff. This is the most sexist environment that I have ever worked in. Not enough paid maternity leave. Very difficult for staff to take vacations and sick days.
