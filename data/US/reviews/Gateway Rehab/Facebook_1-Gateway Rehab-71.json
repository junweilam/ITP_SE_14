Health is ICHRA, basically subcontractor picks 7-8 choices from the BIG names in your area in the marketplace. Then, based on age and family component, you get a $$$ amount to pick from the choices. Bottom line, health benefits can run from a tank of gas to that new car payment in cost. Overall, health benefits are average at best. Dental and Vision, below average but cheap. All start first of month after start date.\r\n\r\nPTO: they love to claim up to 29 days*** (note asterisk). 29 days is possible provided you work greater than 60 hours a week AND get approved for the OT. ACTUAL PTO is closer to 18 days. NOTE: NO PAID HOLIDAYS (you pay yourself via your PTO), NO SICK DAYS. Therefore, after the 5 or 6 holidays, your actual usable PTO is 12 to 13 days.\r\n\r\nStaffing: like everywhere else, short-staffed. For RN's expect to be mandated 2-3 times a quarter. Pseudo self scheduling, pick the w/e you cannot work, and they pick everything else.\r\n\r\nBreaks: take up smoking, as that is the only way you get breaks. Lunch and breaks are rare, although they deduct the lunch from your paycheck.\r\n\r\nCompensation: slightly below market averages for licensed/certified staff, for unlicensed/certified staff, Walmart pays $5 an hour more! Raises: LESS than 1%\r\n\r\nManagement: New(er) management, talented, but absent most of the time. Although they micromanage well via email, and while they are absent, they surprisingly know about things that happen almost immediately (funny how that is). New management inherited a mess, the current thought process is to streamline, which means more job duties for the staff.\r\n\r\nWork environment: Some VERY talented people, and then some... well, not everyone can be talented. \r\n\r\nCulture: Will spend $$$ on silly things like paintings and rocking chairs, but all the computers are over 10 years old and other than the lobby the decors is not well maintained and very dated. Money is not invested into staff and clearly not the premises.\r\n\r\nAdvancement: zero, and to be honest you probably would not want the responsibility anyway.\r\n\r\nStaff Development: They can't staff to start with. The few things they expect you to do on your own time, getting paid for it is a challenge.\r\n\r\nOverall, a revolving door, lately though they do not replace, just add more job duties to the staff.
