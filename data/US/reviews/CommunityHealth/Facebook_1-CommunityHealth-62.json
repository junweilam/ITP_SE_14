Employees are made to feel guilty and shamed for seeking change and improvement in their treatment. Upper management are unsupportive and disconnected from staff. Executive director is unapproachable intentionally and pretends that she is an open book and open to criticism. The only way to describe the assistant executive director is just a mean woman whom everyone fears and avoids. CommunityHealth uses a culture of fear to control and manipulate its employees. Even though everyone enjoys the actual work, the treatment of employees leads to burnout and extreme dissatisfaction with work life. Staff turnover in 2012 and 2013 was roughly 40%. Excluding upper management, almost no one is able to stay at CommunityHealth for more than 2 years. Upper management is unwilling to address this issue and refuses to take measures to fix this trend, which must lead to decreased productivity and much staff time being spent on re-hiring. Most people leave on very tense terms because of unhappiness, and upper management hides this from board members and donors. The salaries, especially for front desk staff, are appallingly low, even for non-profits. Since salaries and wages are low one would expect excellent benefits. This is not how CommunityHealth operates. With the low wages, insurance and benefits are terrible. Even with a staff of 95% women, there is absolutely no maternity leave, and women are forced to pay for 100% of their insurance to keep it if they choose to take unpaid leave. There is also no guarantee of a job when someone decides to return to work. Much more could be said here. It is very sad that a place that does such wonderful work treats its employees so poorly. Its mission is wonderful, but seems to apply only to patients and not to employees. Due to the vulnerability of staff with poor salaries and benefits, and no access to maternity leave, many staff would be in the same position as our patients."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Wonderful coworkers and patients, poor leadership and employee treatment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Sept 2013", "job_title": "Professional in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "\u2013 - great staff: dedicated, passionate, helpful, low-drama, competent\r\n- patients: often grateful, good structure to help patients\r\n- lots of autonomy in your work\r\n- there is some lip service to the concern that staff morale is quite low, but little action other than token benefits (such as Xmas party or discounted movie tickets)\r\n- recent employee survey showed satisfaction on most things between 78-83%. The Executive Director expressed concern (although is so disconnected that she doesn't understand why, nor asks or engages to find out why). Executive Director is fake, out-of-touch with what is happening in the clinic. Says she\u2019s worried regarding low employee morale, but then doesn\u2019t do anything to address it.\r\n- there was a plan to hire a human resources consultant in order to fix the situation, but staff feels threatened by that since many human resources personnel seem to just reinforce management's philosophy", "cons": "- comparably lower benefits to other non-profits/clinics: low pay (they blame it on resources and then judge you if you if you negotiate for more); poor vacation benefits (only 2 weeks for the first 3 years); only paid hourly for 37.5 hours/week, but you must take a half-hour lunch that is unpaid. However, the ED makes $140,000+ and the Associate Executive Director makes $88K. They seem to have enough money for their salaries.\r\n- no maternity leave policy since not big enough for FMLA\r\n- worse is the motto is \u201cno one should have to go without health care\u201d but as soon as a female employee goes on maternity leave they cease to pay for her health insurance (meaning she either has to go on her partner\u2019s insurance or go on welfare)\r\n- health care reform is around the corner and we are losing patients, but management won't discuss whether they are planning on downsizing staff. They say they will not be closing their doors, but nothing about whether jobs will be eliminated.\r\n- human resources try to make it seem like monthly employee potlucks and discounts on movie tickets are benefits, instead of real benefits like more paid vacation, paid maternity leave or better insurance (organization only pays for 80% of premium\r\n- high turn over (management has been there for 6-14 years, while staff stays for about 1-3 years). I\u2019ve been there for less than 2 years and over 1/3 of the staff has turned over.\r\n- staff feels appreciated by each other, but feels unappreciated by management\r\n- few-to-no advancement possibilities\r\n- volunteer-based providers (doctors and nurse practitioners) -- so quality of care is based on volunteer commitment, not workplace accountability\r\n- Associate Executive Director has a reputation for extreme mood swings and poor treatment of employees and even yelling at  berating coworkers (grown adults!). Much of the issues in terms of turn over and employee morale seem to stem from her management, but upper management and the board don't seem to care or recognize it.\r\n- The organization needs new blood, new ideas and more progressive leadership that cares about employees in a genuine way."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Communications Associate in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A friendly work environment full of great people.", "cons": "There are no cons to working at this company."}], []]
