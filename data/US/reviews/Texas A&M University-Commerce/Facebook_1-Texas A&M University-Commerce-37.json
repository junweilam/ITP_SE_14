There have been numerous audits throughout the campus over the years for various kinds of illicit activity devised by managers. \r\n\r\nMultiple departments and services on campus were outsourced in a bid to make it look like the University was saving money when it came time for Systems to perform an audit. The motivation for the audit was the number of VIP level individuals the campus has as well as their unethical level of pay. VIPs on campus such as the President make enormous salaries that are unethical when you consider the cost of living and average salaries of most people in the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nSerious job opportunities are lacking. You can find a part time job as a student, but long-term, full-time employment is limited. Additionally, even for positions requiring bachelors or masters and seeking years of experience they will routinely underpay relative to even the surrounding levels, let alone national averages. \r\n\r\nTo advance will also require that you play the game and suck-up to corrupt management, even in cases where previously mentioned illicit activity is on-going. Many fellow colleagues have been harassed by management for making sure to follow system policy and the law instead of bending to orders from management. Some have even been harassed horribly after reporting to system auditing; the problem is that rarely is anything really done. The offending managers will usually simply be moved somewhere else on campus with a different title but still make the same money and still causing trouble.\r\n\r\nI would highly advise anyone to pass on this place!
