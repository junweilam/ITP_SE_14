Christians for thousands of years have disagreed on theological topics and its not fair to say that  \"historically, there has been general agreement among all true Christians\" when there have been disagreements and different denominations.

Wives' day might have been more necessary when Cru began and women tended to do most of the housework, but even as a married woman myself, it seems unfair to give me a whole day to do whatever I want when my husband helps out with his share of our household tasks while single people have to do it all on the weekend (when you aren't already working on the weekend). \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of required conferences that seem expensive for what you get; it can feel like being forced to pay money to be forced to \"recharge.\" \r\n\r\nMany of the current organizational changes happening aren't bad, per se, but the way they are being communicated can be confusing and isolating. I don't think that's the intent at all, which is a bummer. But I think there's a generational disconnect, and it will tie back to types of teams -- I like the idea of being more catalytic and sending people where there's a need, but I also really would hate to send my prize students off into the intern lotto machine and have them dropped somewhere alone with a team that doesn't get along the way ours does. I also think the big vision currently being presented about doing more and reaching more wears out metro campus teams who are already spread thin -- maybe a traditional university's Cru movement will have the capacity to add high schools or other new target areas, but for a movement already on a bunch of schools without being acknowledged for being on that level already, it feels like more guilt and pressure to be even busier.
