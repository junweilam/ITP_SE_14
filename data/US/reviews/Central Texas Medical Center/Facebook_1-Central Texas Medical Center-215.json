If you are offended by prayer, don't work here. \r\n\r\nOne of the things I miss the most is the hospital's cafe. Employees are able to payroll deduct discounted meals with their ID badge.

Because we are a smaller hospital, everyone knows everyone. So, communication between departments are easy with more face to face time, rather than sent electronically. There can never be enough communication, but CTMC achieves at covering different approaches. \n\nCTMC is also not afraid to acknowledge hard workers, or great jobs. It might sound irrelevant because \"it\u2019s your job\", but it means the world to have leadership recognize you when you done a great job or just went the extra mile.\n\nCTMC Leadership is outstanding. This is one of the first places I work, where the leaders involve everyone on the team. They are not afraid to train employees for leadership role, while at the same time making sure those individuals meet the requirements for a leader. It\u2019s not about \"experience\" at CTMC, because the only way you get that is with time. What CTMC looks for employees who are team players, and who communicate with not only employees but patients. CTMC does not let bias or favoritism play a role, but rather \"is that individual the right person for the job\". The leaders here focus and give you task based on your strengths, and at the same time strengthen your weak.\nComing to work here was probably one of the best career moves I have ever made. \n\nOne of the biggest pros I have seen at this hospital is CTMC's commitment to the community well being.

CTMC works by seniority not by your ability or intelligence level.  House supervisors know where to find things but not how to handle critical situations, nor do the physicians.  Overall management is very poor.  Staffing is less than adequate.  The computer software used is not efficient nor user friendly.  You spend 80% of your time charting and very little time with your patients.  When Doctors place orders about 60% of them don't apply,  they are just pre-populated.....confusing!
