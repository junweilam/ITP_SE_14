Employees that quit due to this toxic environment are gossiped about openly by leadership in meetings and used as of an example of what happens if you don\u2019t abide by their dishonesty and fraud. Yearly reviews are staged to ensure that people they do not like will be put on a performance evaluation and therefore can be easily fired. When HR is contacted they do nothing.

They were apparently in denial and they branded me as a troublemaker, and one of them even told me \"not to rock the boat.\" At one point they sent me a referral to EAP. Instead of having my work-related concerns and issues addressed when I met the counselor, she asked me instead about my upbringing and my past romantic relationship. (What in Sam Hill?!)\r\n \r\nThe periodic Gallup polls as an opportunity for employees to rate the organization were a massive waste of time and company resources since apparently the powers that be didn't do anything to improve the situation. The management didn't really care at best and was mostly patronizing at worst. \r\n\r\nAfter a while in the department, there was nothing challenging or stimulating. It was stagnant. I was also denied opportunities to transfer to other departments, keeping me trapped there longer. Many employees there felt stuck and miserable (for the same reasons I left the organization), believing they wouldn't get any better job offer out there. They didn't want to lose the secure money and benefits and that kept them chained there. It was scary that the dynamics there in the department were a lot like those in a domestic violence situation. \r\n\r\nI had no choice but to cut my losses and submitted my resignation notice after having worked there for a few years. I decided to stop cosigning their nonsense, and they promptly released me that same day with a few \"goodies\" as a parting gift. I absolutely had ZERO regrets doing that and I never looked back. I even managed to not yield to the temptation of working for this organization again even when I needed money the most during the economic meltdown.\r\n\r\nI'm actually not the one with the same complaints. I personally know MANY people with similar (or worse) experiences working at LLUMC. \r\n\r\nIn short, LLUMC absolutely has no redeeming value whatsoever except for the generous benefits package it offers. (Well, at least I did put the insurance to very good use for my frequent stress-related symptoms!) \r\n\r\nIf you're the free-spirited, creative NF/NFP type (BTW, I'm using Myers-Briggs terms for those of you who are familiar with the stuff), exit stage left before you even enter this institution. It's a horrible cultural fit for you as it's mostly populated by the conventional, rigid ST/STJ types.\r\n\r\nRegardless of personality type, I still wouldn't really recommend this place for employment. There are TONS of better, more savvy organizations and companies out there. They know better. They recognize that bennies extend beyond the usual package of health/dental/vision/life insurance, retirement funds, etc. Many people want a positive, flexible, supportive, and accommodating lifestyle-affirming environment. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I'm awarding LLUMC only a one-star rating. It's actually 1 1/2 stars (the bonus 1/2 is for the benefits package), but there are no halves here. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, there have been (are?) good departments with positive work environment, but there hasn't been any consistency with LLUAHSC quality across the board. So it's pretty much a crapshoot, really. You may or may not end up in a lousy department. \r\n\r\nThis has left a really bad taste in my mouth, so until now I'm still affirming that the forgiving love of Jesus Christ is healing and releasing both me and the organization from the experience of the past and we all go free to be happy."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Happy", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Loma Linda, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I enjoy working at LLUMC because my coworkers are all friendly and helpful.
