When I initially accepted this job, I had hoped to work my way up. Unfortunately, the base pay was disappointingly low, making it an unattractive proposition. I was incredibly grateful when the other company approached me with their offer. On my first day at my previous workplace, I experienced exhaustion to the point of almost tears, and the thought of returning there filled me with dread. The employees consistently mentioned the shortage of staff and frequent turnover, which became apparent why. The workload was overwhelming, and the compensation did not justify the effort. It would have been different if the job wasn't demanding, but they themselves admitted to being weeks behind in enrollment, which I was supposed to help fix. It simply wasn't worth it. I must admit, though, that everyone there was exceptionally kind, and that made me hesitate about accepting the new offer.

Turnover among faculty and staff is colossal. They do nothing about it. They know it is due to paying about half per hour what they should, but yet they don't change their rate and you cannot argue for more per hour. They will not offer you more hours because they do not want to have to offer any benefits. You are a hourly employee and will get less than 15-20 hours a week no matter what your education or experience. No promotions or raises of any kind. You will be assigned more work than you could ever fit into those hours and you will get emails harassing you should you go over your hours. You will also get negativity only from management. For example, if you overlook something in a class, they email you and threaten your job, but will never email you to tell you something positive that you're doing. Only negative. The micromanagement is out of this world, I have never seen micromanaging this heavy. Again, only to tell you what you've done wrong, never to recognize anything you've gone above and beyond for. They claim they are student focused but everyone knows it is all about making the professors do the most about of work for the least amount of pay. People quit left and right because they refuse to budge on pay and hours. Also due to the excessive control they have over you. They will log into your classes whenever they feel and try to find things that are wrong. Not because they have any concern for students, but because they need to make sure people are working themselves to death but are also staying under their hours. They claim you can make suggestions but no one does because they will retaliate. If they said theybwould take an anonymous poll of their faculty and staff regarding these exact issues, no one would answer honestly because they know it is not really anonymous. It's almost a cult-like atmosphere, I've seen that comment before about westcliff and now I understand it. I wonder how much longer they want to play the turnover game before they realize that paying more, giving more hours, and holding management accountable for being incapable is the answer."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Westcliff review", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Student Services Advisor in Irvine, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lovely environment, colleagues and staff.", "cons": "Very undeveloped and understaffed for awhile now."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Would Not Reccomend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Student Accounts Representative in Irvine, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It has a hybrid work system and full benefits.", "cons": "The lack of an automated system makes every single task incredibly frustrating, tedious, and time consuming.

There is not enough staff so often student needs get neglected by necessity to get the daily tasks required to allow the university done. For example, having 900 unread emails for the student accounts department is a common occurrence- and supervisors will tell you to ignore the emails in favor of other more pressing tasks. This hurts the students most of all and understandably leads to them getting very frustrated and stressed out. The lack of an automated system and the lack of comprehensive training leaves a lot of room for human error, which again often hurts the students. Depsite having worked here for six months there are still so many student questions or questions from staffed that I haven't been trained on and thus don't know how to answer. Requesting training means my supervisor will string me along for weeks saying they'll get to it and then eventually giving me a rushed training in the last thirty minutes of my shift which covered the basics and nothing more. The management is clearly not equipped to lead even a small team to success and this makes the life of everyone on the team worse by adding utterly unnecessary complications and stress.

Westcliff University can be considered as a developing and growing company, but from the CEO to all the managers of different levels or departments, they are extremely professional and kind. When I first started the job, my manager established a thorough training schedule, which definitely gave me a clear idea of the company culture and responsibilities. I had the opportunity to get to know the different managers from various professional backgrounds. While having those trainings, my manager also allowed me some time to self-reflect on what I have learned from that day. My manager would also reference outside professional experience to give me a different perspective. Moreover, occasionally we will have some cross-training with other departments to not only help us with our job but also gave us the opportunity to build great relationships with all the other departments. This enabled me to provide the best service to our students. Very often my manager would hold a team meeting to allow all of us to get to know each other on a deeper level. Therefore, our communication within the team was never an issue. Occasionally, we would also have events off campus and they always tried to accommodate everyone's schedule. I remembered I missed a couple of events, even the yacht party, but was quickly updated by my teammates with fun pictures. They always made be feel included no matter what. Some events also included staff awards to show their appreciation and recognition of our hard work. \r\n\r\nWestcliff University has a friendly working environment. Everyone treated each other as a family and genuinely cared for one another. I always felt that they treated everyone fairly. My schedule was flexible and my team and I always worked out coverage for each other if someone couldn't work a specific shift. If I made a mistake my manager would correct me immediately, but would always provide encouraging suggestions for improvements. Moreover, the company really cared about the self-development and professional development of the employees to maximize each person's potential. There were in-house presentations and guest speakers who came to provide workshops to help us with our development. Besides that, take me for an example, my manager saw my ambition and potential and specifically assigned me to work with another department in order to learn additional skills. This was a great opportunity for me and I am really grateful for that. \r\n\r\nOverall, Westcliff is a place you can call home, a place you can truly grow, and filled with joy and love while working there.", "cons": "Processes were constantly and evolving, but that makes sense in a growing company."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Growth, Loyalty, Effort, Innovation", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 May 2019", "job_title": "Admissions/Outreach in Irvine, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I saw Westcliff in it's beginning and was part of their initial growth... no one understands the tremendous pressure of starting a business unless they have done it themselves and the upper management team is a shining example of hard work and innovation. There's an incredible amount of energy and resources required to make sure students are served, employees are paid, and... as every single business is designed to do... create a profit so they can grow each year and serve everyone better. The fact that they were able to exceed expectations in this venture and become as large as they are so quickly is the result of a loyal, dedicated, hard working and innovative staff. They expect the best out of everyone. In today's society of weak minded lazy college grads they are doing something different to create strong minds with their employees through high expectations. They promote that students develop not just hard skills, but soft skills backing their education, so they don't show up to job interviews like a deer in headlights! People see what they want to see and if people are expecting to just coast by at a company like this they won't last. You'll need to exceed expectations and if you stick it out you'll be better for it. That's how it is when you're basically part of a University startup! These days they are much more than that. They've started up.\r\n\r\nThe recent change in location is evidence enough of the incredible dedication of upper management to provide a growth environment and create employment opportunities. Their  loyalty to their students and staff is truly that of a family beyond the family members that work there. People like those who leave bad reviews see what they want to see and I was a part of helping Westcliff staff filter through the best of the best staff members to create the growth environment that exists today. There are many stories of individuals that started in basic positions like admissions and student services and have now become directors and assistant directors... NONE of them related to anyone in any way.", "cons": "The bull pen style environment can get cramped, but you can't start out at the top.

During my time here I was promoted vertically and then horizontally. I started off in Admissions as an advisor, and within 2 years I moved into an Assistant Director of Admission (ADOA) position helping co-manage a team of 10-13 people. After 2.5 years in that ADOA role, I decided I would like to be considered for the Career Services Dept, and I was granted this opportunity from management who believed in me, and continue to do so.  Over the last 5 years, I have seen us skyrocket in growth. Of course, there has been growing pains, but all around Westcliff University has been consistently better month after month and year after year.  We had approximately 50 students in 2014 and now we have roughly 2,400 students worldwide \u2013 97 percent growth! This is highly impressive in an industry where several Universities are closing, yet we are flourishing.  This significant growth has been due to several factors, but mainly it is due to our high referral rate from our students who see the quality of our education (WASC & DEAC accreditation) and dedicated staff/faculty \u2013 94 percent of students would recommend us!  When you experience growth like we have, you will attract and keep those who wish to grow with the University \u2013 those who are not only mission driven, but those who are adaptable, welcome change, like challenges, like to support each other and are excellent problem solvers.  As a reminder to those that worry about changes, the Education industry consistently changes to keep up with innovations, accrediting body requirements and public demand and with that comes process/policy changes.  I have always been drawn to innovative, challenging, yet nurturing environments, with positive people who motivate you and push you to grow, and give you opportunities to take on projects \u2013 Westcliff University has this! With time, along with my typical admissions duties, I had the opportunity to assist in the creation and development of several projects (professional University-wide videos/documents/resources, event planning, webinar hosting, technology research and development, outreach events, professional development workshop creation, and enhancing other services to students). My teammates throughout the years have also been given several projects to work on as well that have transformed them professionally. We have 2 admissions seniors that within 1-1.5 years received a title and salary promotion. I see how other staff show a sense of pride from supporting our students and having ownership on their projects. Westcliff leadership takes care of their employees, listens to feedback and takes appropriate actions when needed. Some things take time, because it involves several factors, but with time, I have seen countless developments suggested by staff: employee manual, campus events, professional development workshops, new technology, etc. I have seen promotions for many advisors across all departments through the years. It seems like every 2-3 months there is another promotion - not exaggerating. Those who get promoted (are not family/friends by the way) \u2013 It is those who consistently show their dedication to students, stay up to date with knowledge, show professionalism and maturity, those who exert leadership, take initiatives, and collaborate well with others.  Additionally, leadership shows their appreciation for all staff by offering semester employee outings, both as departments and as a company: go to local restaurants, bowling, Dave & Busters, OC Fair, Escape Rooms, Paint & Wine, Taco Catering, Staff Appreciation events. \r\n\r\nIn response to complaints on this website, just know there is ALWAYS two sides to a story, and there several employees who are happy and have continued to work here throughout the years. If you are seeking to have hard established routines, zero innovation, zero changes, only doing what is listed in your job description exactly, not support others, then this may not be for you. As a side note, Directors are not family \u2013 we call ourselves family because of how we take care of each other, support each other personally/professionally, and we have a common mission \u2013 to educate, inspire, and empower our students.", "cons": "With all the  growth and exciting initiatives,  I recommend that more communication is shared as much as possible to keep everyone in loop of all the developments."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Opportunities for Growth with Amazing People", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I\u2019ve been working at Westcliff University for several years and there are plenty of opportunities for growth. The staff and management team are amazing people and the majority of people you ask would also agree! \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of opportunities to be promoted horizontally and vertically. I actually came in as a part-time staff member to work as an assistant in one of the departments and shortly after they recognized my hard work, I was asked to stay full-time. Not only have I been promoted, I have also seen promotions throughout all departments. I have seen many staff members who have excelled from an entry-level position to mid-level and/or senior-level management position.\r\n\r\nThe university hires often because they are growing; therefore, in order to support students, staff, and faculty effectively, they need to continue to hire more staff. Those who genuinely care about students and believe in the mission of the university tend to have a more positive attitude. Unfortunately, there are some staff who do not have the same mission as the university and sometimes try to influence others. The reality is that every place you work at will have people who will gossip about their different perspectives (positive or negative). The important thing to remember is only the strong minded will NOT be influenced by just \"one\" perspective. Many of the staff members have their good days and bad days, but I truly feel a good number of the staff members can decipher between a common problem that just needs to be addressed versus what has become an individual's personal problem that was taken out of context. There are always multiple perspectives to every situation.\r\n\r\nThe university have amazing staff who work hard together to support students. Many of them come into an entry-level position and have potential to be future leaders of this current society. Why wouldn\u2019t Westciff University want to develop them? Of course they do! Everyone treats each other like a family not only within the department but also across departments. My reference to \"family\" is the actual family \"culture\", which has been misconstrued as if there were many friends/family members working at the university. To help put into perspective based on some of the reviews, some employees have referred their friends and/or family to apply for jobs at the university. Referrals are common in every company. Nonetheless, these referrals only resulted to a few friends/family out of 100+ employees that are working at Westcliff. This is not much at all if you really think about it. There are also some employees who have worked here for many years and also share the same mission and values, which naturally allowed them to develop strong bonds and treat each other like a family. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the management team cares about the growth of the staff and the university. There are occasional presentations that are held to promote personal and professional growth. The CEO, in particular, is an intelligent, educated individual who is also going through the same growing pains as the staff, just on a different level. He is fair to all employees, whether they are at the entry-level or management level. Everyone just has to remember that the CEO is also human and could very well make mistakes just like all of us. However, he is genuine, reflective and is always willing to make a change. In the past year there have already been great changes and I'm sure his vision is to continue to make improvements. \r\n\r\n\"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.\"  -- Warren Bennis", "cons": "Sometimes the university is growing a little too fast but these growing pains are challenges that are inevitable."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "FREE T-Shirt for this Review", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Admissions Advisor in Irvine, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "~ Hard-working coworkers\r\n~ A $15 Free meal at the end of every 16 weeks (after recruitment) \r\n~ Cubicle windows to see the faces of my coworkers", "cons": "~ Manipulative Bosses\r\n~ Free t-shirt for this review \r\n~ Most of the \"positive reviews\" on here are fake \r\n~ Not enough benefits"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Assistant Professor", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are many opportunities for faculty involvement.\r\n\r\nI love being a professor here!\r\n\r\nFaculty can voice their opinions in various ways. \r\n\r\nStudents are hardworking and care about their grades.", "cons": "I do not have any cons."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best Atmosphere For a University", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Costa Mesa, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing atmosphere, wonderful/kind people, plenty of opportunities for growth within the company, uplifting staff who is always there to help!", "cons": "The school is outgrowing it's facilities, but is managing well for their level of growth."}]]
