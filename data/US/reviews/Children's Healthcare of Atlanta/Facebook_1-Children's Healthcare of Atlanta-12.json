Then the pandemic happened and we granted the opportunity to work from home, however, there were clear reservations. My team was very effective over the 3-month timeframe as were others, however, some were not which is to be expected. All jobs aren't meant to be remote. Once stay-at-home orders began to be lifted, CHOA wasted no time in thinking through how they could get their employees back in that pretty building. Leadership began phasing in as early as June 1st with staff back in two weeks later. Work from home options yet again ceased and the building is back at 100% capacity (probably not 100%, but that is certainly the intent). Leadership has not requested any feedback from their employees which lets us know they really don't care about how we feel or what we think. They are forcing us to expose ourselves and families to this virus that is more out of control now than it was when we started working from home.

The CEO and CAO are running the corporate side like a dictatorship. They think they are untouchable, I do not blame them because there is no accountability whatsoever. People have been complaining for years for this to change and nothing has. Everyone is afraid to call them out because retaliation is the normal there. Since nobody will stand up for what is right, the directors put so much pressure on their employees to the point of burnout. The employees receive no recognition for their hard work and the directors take all of the credit. It was also kind of difficult to see people in management positions or higher who do not even know what your job description is. \r\nIt is also hard to not take notice that CHOA is still functioning years behind other workplaces. Teleworking is a thing of the past. They only allowed it when Covid hit but it was ONLY because it was forced. They did not care about the health and well-being of their employees. It was also said if Covid numbers increased, they would not shut down again. \r\nIt would also be better if CHOA was more transparent. I would be willing to bet if they were more truthful about the furloughs, they would have employees rating them higher because they would have felt important enough to be informed. Instead they announced it out of the blue AND told management to lie about what happened to said employees. If employees were truly being let go, the employee was told they cannot talk about it or they would lose their pay. They use bully tactics to put fear in their staff to keep them quiet.

I cannot speak for the hospital side. 99% of jobs outside of Patient Access lack diversity in a major way. It seems people of color are only hired for Patient Access roles. When you look at VP's, Executives, Upper Management, HR, and anything other than Patient Access, you will see only a dab of diversity. The newly built support building proves this. Just by walking certain floors, you will see 99% of people of color sit on one floor, and walking other floors, you will see 99% are filled with non-people of color and only a small drop of \"diversity\" if you will. \r\n\r\nWhen the new support building was put up, they completely took away work from home. Which is essentially going backwards in a time where we can be advancing forward in the world. Choa is having us contribute to the detriment of the environment by making us commute to work when we have the ability to work from home. The stress of Georgia traffic alone is detrimental to your physical and mental health. However, as stated before, this is all about money. They spent a lot of money on the new building so they want us in there using it. There could have been a better plan to build something on a smaller scale that allows us to work from home if we are able. We now have to share cubicle space in this new building and it is very open and distracting. \r\n\r\nDuring the pandemic they have handled it in the worst way by making us borrow money from the company that we have to pay back in order to meet our 40 hours. They gave us the option to \u201cre-deploy\u201d and work in the hospital but seriously, who wants to put themselves at risk by going to work in the hospital? They are also forcing us to come back to work on 6/29/2020, knowing we cannot social distance due to the fact that we share cubicles. While our competitors have allowed their employees to work from home indefinitely, this speaks volumes on the way Choa operates. They stated in so many words that they do not care about our children & not having access to daycare/summer camps, nor do they care if you have to look after someone who is immunocompromised. As stated, it is all about money. They paid for the building so they want us in there no matter how much it puts us at risk, by any means necessary. With COVID numbers increasing & no medical solution in sight, they want us to risk our lives coming to work when we have the ability to continue to work from home. It\u2019s as if we are being punished for not being able to work in a building they spent money on. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this company is money hungry and only cares about the dollar and not the employee. They will sell you a dream of a \"career\" but keep you stuck in roles that do not allow for any advancement while giving promotions to non-people of color.  Sometimes even your own manager/supervisor will prevent you from growth within the company. They do not care about what is best for their employees, only what benefits them at the expense of the employees who work hard to keep their operations running with little to no reward. They are an illogical thinking company that operates on the basis of, \u201cif it doesn\u2019t make sense, it makes sense.\u201d \r\n\r\nIf you are a person of color, beware. If you care about your mental health, beware. If you care about work-life balance, beware. If you are looking for growth and opportunity, this is not the company for you.

When someone on their team steps up to  address the situation, the manager  may have even asked the person to help, once the situation is resolved by the employee, the manager feels threatened and will hold it against the direct employee,  even going as far as creating a hostile work environment or slandering the person's integrity.
