With any service role you are going to come into some rude people. \r\n\r\nOverall though, it was disappointing to see that the faculty tended to be the rudest, though some were very nice. The faculty are under a lot of pressure at DTS, but many of them have taken an elitist attitude which does not help a ministry environment. \r\n\r\nDTS is a personality-promotion environment. In other words, people are given position and power because they are friends with a leader, or through other political maneuvering. This it how it works: there are many jobs at the school that require skills sets that have little or nothing to do with the skill set the school teaches (theological studies). But, because the school's leadership's skill set is theological studies and teaching, they tend to promote people who have that same skill set, even to positions that have little to nothing to do with that. What DTS has ended up with is an environment that has more respect for people who can politically maneuver themselves (play politics) to positions they might never acquire outside the school. Some of the staff are vastly under-qualified to do their job. Though, I don't expect DTS is any different than other theological schools in this way. \r\n\r\nThe compensations, both in salary and benefits, at DTS is poor. The HR department maintains that compensation is competitive, but that dose not mean it is reasonable or even livable."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great people to work with!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Operations Manager At Washington Hall in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Christian environment, tuition assistance, work on campus.
