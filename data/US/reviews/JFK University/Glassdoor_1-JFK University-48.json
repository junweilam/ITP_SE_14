But once he got to know us, and saw what our purpose in the community is he was fully on board. The problem for some is that he wants accountability and some could not deal with having to be accountable. He did a great job. He had integrity and purpose. He loved this university. It was not his fault JFKU became part of the National University System. The previous president did that. We are not owned by National University. I wish people would stop telling that lie. We are affiliated with the National University System. We may or may not agree with all of the decisions but we either roll with it or find a new job. Telling half-truths does not serve anyone. As far as the review about Dr. Powell eaves dropping on confidential conversations; I do not believe it.
