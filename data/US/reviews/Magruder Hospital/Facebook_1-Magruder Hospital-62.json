I turned out that I was the first NP to come to this place and work full-time in my position and the management appeared to have no idea on how to create this new position; what support my position might require or even how to treat a professional. I had little to no support. I had no office, I had no phone, no mailbox, no PC. I had no place to dictate my encounters. I had no support staff or case managers to run the day-to-day business.  It turned out that it was a very bad idea accepting a job with this employer in the Urgent Care / Occupational Health clinic. I was treated very unprofessionally by my manager, like a factory worker.  I was hired and told that they needed my consultation and experience as I had opened these new clinic successfully in the past. It turned out they just wanted a worker bee. The staff and leadership are mostly small town rural folk, have been there for many years, doing things their own way, they don't want to hear how anyone else does anything and are rudely resistant to change and outsiders. The constant gossip in this place was mind-numbing. There is very arbitrary and selective policy enforcement which management uses to meet their ever-changing personal objectives and to manipulate the staff to those ends. They have very regular internal announcements about their \"top ratings\" which appear to be clearly manufactured. Final word, if you do accept a position with this employer - insist on a contract drawn up by an attorney with contract experience. If they refuse, that tells you all you need to know. A good employer has no fear of a contract. They know how to treat their employees and how to keep their word. The physical plant is outdated and in bad need of repair. Our toilets were constantly backing up and overflowing in a brand new clinic. The emergency department is badly in need of a complete rebuild. There are people in management positions which are completely unqualified in terms of their education and experience but have been there so long that the management does not know how to get rid of them. There is then the second dilemma that management has allowed their employment to continue for so many years in the first place with full knowledge that the employee is obviously unqualified for the job which reflects poorly on senior management. There are people who have only worked in this place their whole careers and nowhere else and this contributes to the problem of change resistance and lack of a view of how the real world works in healthcare."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "A great place to work!!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "3 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Supervisor in Port Clinton, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the best reasons to work at Magruder Hospital is the exceptional patient care, Safety compliance, and the kind hearted staff that truly care.", "cons": "Pay grades could be better.
