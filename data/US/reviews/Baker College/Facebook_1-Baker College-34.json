I have had coworkers that couldn't even schedule a honeymoon or attend other important family events because they conflicted with orientation. \r\n\r\nI do not know what the atmosphere is like at any of the other Baker campuses, but Allen Park is a  depressing campus to work at. Most of the faculty and staff are demoralized by the poor treatment by the campus president. The campus president is not open to listening to his employees, and is more concerned about the physical appearance of the buildings than student learning. You will hear a lot about the campus not having enough money to invest in support staff or student learning, but the campus president will spend thousands and thousands of dollars on cosmetic changes like changing the lighting, painting designs on the walls, or building a more appealing parking lot. There's no place on campus for employees to have lunch or even take a break on campus unless you want to be in the student center and get bombarded with questions from students -- take your lunches off-campus.

So, we always have to be on our 'A' game.  Fortunately student evaluations are one measure of our performance, but not the exclusive measure; contributions outside the classroom are measured, expected and contribute to positive evaluations.  Recent staff realignments hit PhD faculty at our campus, which was completely unexpected.  \r\nStaffing alignment is appropriately dependent on student enrollment.  The school's core market of students is dependent on external funding to study -- either federally guaranteed student loans, grants or other outside scholarships.  Cuts to those external programs have immediate impacts on enrollment.\r\nDespite providing lifetime placement assistance to our graduates, the school does not have an outside alumni association or foundation that solicits supports for infrastructure or student scholarships.  This contributes to our vulnerability to external funding fluctuations.\r\nA good number of support staff have been hired after completing degrees here, so there is a bit of an in-bred \"we've always done it that way\" mentality in some departments.  Some of the staff have become apathetic, \"whatever management wants today,\" which can be dispiriting.  \r\nA large pool of current management is reaching retirement age concurrently.  They have agreed amongst themselves to stage their retirements in order to prevent total organizational shock from one large out-flux.  Stepping into these roles are both externally recruited and internally promoted academic professionals with advanced educations (reputable PhDs) and new ideas, which are shaking up the longer-term staff quite a bit.  Change is in the wind; some of it forced due to this resistance.  \r\nI'm looking forward to improvements in IT applications -- internally developed systems were \"reframed\" with Windows overlays, but they remain the same cumbersome legacy applications that require significant internal support.  The new VP of IT has initiated a search for an externally-developed true ERP application network to support our operations.\r\nWorkload as a faculty member is significant:  I teach five classes of 25 students each, support a student club, hold office hours and special review sessions, manage a pool of adjunct faculty and student tutors, contribute to the curriculum updates and rework, provide system-wide support for multiple classroom-focused technology initiatives, and conduct tours of the campus for prospective students.  Fortunately for me, I personally find satisfaction in being able to manage so many initiatives at once; others may find the workload imposing.  Our employment agreement specifically excludes outside teaching initiatives, not that I would have the time to take anything else onto my plate.\r\nOne does not work in the academic or non-profit sectors for the compensation.  Benefits are very good (healh insurance, etc.), but my salary is less than 1/2 what I was earning in the for-profit sector.

She is absolutely outstanding. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I feel the college have found a balance between ensuring course consistency between campus locations and empowering instructors to do their jobs quite well. They set standard projects and rubrics that account for a percent of the overall possible grade for the course, so there is consistency between campuses and different instructors/instructional styles, while giving instructors the freedom to make the bulk of decisions regarding testing, assignments, styles, etc. \r\n\r\nFinally, I see opportunities to advance from or expand my current position.

I also learned how to enter final grades and document attendance on their electronic system on my own. Thankfully, I am familiar with many of these tools, but I can see where this would be a major problem for someone who is a bit out of touch with newer methods of record keeping and file sharing. I have also come to realize that it is rare to know exactly what classes/days I will be teaching until the week before the classes start, which leaves little time for curriculum development for classes that are new to me. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have had multiple issues receiving payment for training and raises.

I cannot believe I wasted so much time working here but I hope to get out this summer for the fall term, even if I have to get out of education altogether, I will not work here another year.", "cons": "Worst paying postsecondary institution in Michigan - maybe the entire country. The administrative assistants are below the poverty line! They recently discovered this at a financial seminar held by Baker folks themselves!!!! The deans and directors are barely paid what a McDonald\u2019s manager makes, while the management makes 250,000 - 600,000 with faux degrees from an online diploma mill and no prior academic experience. \r\n\r\nThese people invented the term \u201cmicromanage.\u201d Constantly firing people for no reason - talented people. Upper-management only wants \u201cyes\u201d men/women who bow to them, and do not question them about anything. Don\u2019t even make a suggestion. If they think you are smarter than them - you are out. Those who realize this early leave voluntarily - very high turn-over rate. Bonuses are used as threats all year long. Insurance is inadequate with a lot of out of pocket costs. It feels like I don\u2019t even have insurance. \r\n\r\nThey take advantage of people on many levels. Salaried people are expected to work 60+ hours, constantly working until 10:00 PM to work mandatory orientations and expected to be right back in the am at 7:30 for the next orientation. Don\u2019t even think about missing an orientation or you will be on the list for the next round of eliminated positions. \r\n\r\nComplete removal of upper management needs to happen quickly. Even part-time instructors are not happy as they feel mandatory in-services are a complete waste of time - no benefit at all. They are underpaid and overworked - never compensated for the extra work they must do or get replaced. \r\n\r\nManagement is too far removed from situations to be of any help. They are ALWAYS spending hundreds of thousands on useless remodels, but still laying people off and combining 4-5 positions, expecting one person to do the work that was done by 4-5 employees with no compensation. \r\n\r\nThey definitely have the praise up, blame down attitude at Baker. Mgmt will routinely call people to their office and literally yell at them like children, scolding them and treating them no better than treatment prisoners receive.  Completely disrespected and humiliated on a regular basis - ask anyone who works there - deans, associate deans, directors - it doesn't matter - if you are not a relative, you are marked. Nepotism is rampant at all Baker campuses. You don't have to have a degree to be in upper management if you are related to someone who is!! \r\n\r\nThe management tosses around buzz words and the \"flavor of the month,\" but really they have no clue at all. I\u2019ve worked at three campuses and it is the same at every campus. They think they are better than everyone and they disrespect all employees - especially at the Flint campus. Faculty and staff are asked their opinions rarely but if at all it is just to placate them. Employees are not treated as the professionals - not even the deans. The deans cannot make any decisions without the approval of the mgmt. This goes for EVERYTHING from how to respond to a student to ordering sticky notes, to what you say on your voice mail which, by the way, your mandatory voice mail has a 12 point rubric and your supervisor will randomly call it each week and \u201cgrade\u201d you on it and send it to the president who will then send you a nasty email if you didn\u2019t get 100%. \r\n\r\nNo such thing as exit interviews, so they never fix the problems. You cannot even make a complaint or suggestion and forget about HR - go to HR and they are immediately on the phone telling your supervisor every word you said. So much for HR confidentiality.  Many dedicated, good, talented people leave because Baker didn't hear what they had to say or work with them to keep them. \r\n\r\nGood luck using your vacation time. There are too many mandatory dates with PD, orientations, meetings, etc. that you cannot possibly use it and you cannot roll it over. \r\n\r\nStudents definitely run the school. What the student says, we MUST do, and definitely \u201cbend over backwards\u201d for the students who are only there for the financial aid check and will even voice that to faculty. Management will not listen to staff - they will take students word for anything and fear the students will go to the president. They manage by instilling fear in all employees. If students complain it can cost you your job. Students are treated like gold while employees are treated like dirt. \r\n\r\nProbably the worst part is being treated so rudely and disrespectfully by the \"bosses,\" who bully the rest of the employees.  Everyone is in fear of being humiliated, or losing their jobs. To make matters worse, staff is steadily being cut but remodeling continues. Avoid this employer or be prepared to be worked liked a dog, paid minimum wage and disrespected by those running the campus. If you have a real degree, not from a diploma mill like those in charge at Baker, do not waste your time working for them. The college is on a downward spiral - has been since 2012 and it is going down very quickly now - so called leaders are incapable of managing people or their problems. They all have a plan to retire soon, pad their pockets, and run from the mess they have created."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Computer and mathmatical tutor", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Jul 2013", "job_title": "Professional Tutor in Clinton Township, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I really enjoyed helping the people who were right on the cusp of figuring out the answer's for themselves.", "cons": "I did not enjoy someone trying to get me to do their homework.

The entire system of employees were notified by way of 13 emails, worded in a classless manner; no real explanation was given.\r\n\r\nUpper management reminds me of children playing at business, and seem to think they no longer need to follow policy, procedure, or employment laws. \r\n\r\nBaker does not compensate employees well, and think nothing of offering a professional with 15-20 years experience, and graduate degree a salary of $35,000 annually, while management is earning inflated annual salaries and bonuses.\r\n\r\nAnnual bonuses are dangled in front of employees, and each year we receive threats that that small, added compensation will be yanked away.\r\n\r\nUsed to have great medical, dental and vision insurance, but insurance has now been changed to a terrible policy that no doctors want to accept.

There is no system in place to conduct exit interviews - so they never fix the problem of why our staff is leaving.  We have had so many dedicated, good people leave, because Baker didn't hear what they had to say or work with employees to keep them.  There are so many days/weeks/months off that we are not allowed to take, because they are mandatory work days/weeks/months.  Students run our school.  Whatever the student says, we do, just so they can maintain their student status.  We bend over backward for the wrong type of student who steps all over us to make sure they are getting their financial aid - yet take no responsibility for their own education.  Our limited enrollment departments are the only departments where the students are smart and want to learn - the medical departments.  The students here are rude, act entitled, uneducated (it is a right to try school - so anyone can come here), and live off of financial aid.  They are trying to make everything \"centrally located\" which means that Flint (their main office) would be the hub for a lot of departments - financial aid, business office, IT.  This is causing a lot of staff to be cut, yet remodeling offices continues. Our advising department is nearly depleted, yet they expect students to never have to wait to see one of the advisors.

Significant layoffs have taken place, (probably 5 rounds this year that I know about), leaving people without the experience necessary to be successful to fill the voids created. The college handled the layoffs very poorly: communicating the changes very poorly to the \"survivors\" and those affected, and poorly communicating the state of the college.  Thus demonstrating that those who can't do business well,  do actually teach it. Clearly those in leadership positions are not business savvy. Baker has been a case study in \"what not to do\". \r\n\r\nAdditionally some of the college's pay practices have been sketchy at best, encouraging employees to do professional development directly related to their work for the college without pay, or reducing rates of pay without advance notice. \r\n\r\nBaker also does a terrible job preparing the faculty for their roles, making decisions regarding what you will be teaching at the last minute, and making books and resources for the class available too late to be properly prepared. In many cases the UBD (Understanding By Design) courses are designed by people who are not in the field and are clearly not subject matter experts. In addition to having poor content, the UBD restricts the instructor's ability to present relevant material that would actually prepare the students for their future. New faculty is poorly trained on internal systems (Blackboard, APA format, etc.) and resources to help them in their new position. I always feel bad for students who have a new instructor who is struggling to figure things out. They pay for the full class, but clearly don't get the full educational experience.\r\n\r\nHistorically Baker was very proud that the adjunct faculty were working professionals. They did a fantastic job preparing students. Our current direction is making Baker a joke, and the unprepared students are damaging the long-standing reputation.\r\n\r\nThere really isn't room to grow for adjunct faculty. Number of classes available to teach are restricted (due to both union concerns, and ACA restrictions to the number of hours to be benefit eligible). You really don't have much of a voice or any freedom in what to cover for the term or how to teach. At this point Baker should either set up the \"checkout counter\" and handout degrees to anyone who can pay, or sell prerecorded videos of lectures.
