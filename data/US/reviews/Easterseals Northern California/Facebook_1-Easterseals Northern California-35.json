How can you effectively support a client when each of you are on your own? What is the point of a team, then?\r\n\r\nI am not surprised at the high-turnover rate. It is such a disservice to the clients: in those two hours, multiple times a week, they could be learning and growing, but instead,  stagnancy and waste of time that is precious to their critical developmental periods.  It is so sad. Constantly having new BI's, PS's, and CM's does not help at all.\r\n\r\nBI's are the direct line of service. They should be valued and supported when having to implement these behavioral plans, that they did not create, without a BCBA/behavioral analysis background. ESBA does not ensure that the plans are being carried out effectively, if at all (How can you run goals when the clients are constantly engaging in behaviors, and no one supports you in this?).
