Staff from all professions (from housekeeping to RN to MDs) work collaboratively for the good of patients and visitors.  We have a wonderful staff of volunteers that help out in numerous departments.  We have world-renowned doctors, many advanced practice nurses, and a culture in which education and professional/personal improvement are always encouraged.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the wonderful staff, there are many achievements that ANW was been awarded.  We are listed as one of the top hospitals in several areas by several different surveys.  Patient satisfaction is a number one priority.  We are currently applying for Magnet designation; a goal the nursing department has been diligently working on for the past few years.\r\n\r\nThere is truly a culture of collaboration at ANW.  This is one of the reasons that patient's choose ANW over other hospitals in the area.  We have many ancillary departments that specialize in certain areas to provide the best care possible to patients.  Registered dieticians are available for questions, patient teaching, and diet recommendations.  Spiritual care staff is available for staff, family, and patients around the clock for several different religions.  We have a huge integrative medicine department that provides aromatherapy, massage, music therapy, and accupuncture among their list of services.  Social workers are available seven days a week to meet with patients, staff, and family to provide for discharge planning and assistance or to help in difficult decision making processes.  There is an ethics department that consists of staff from several disciplines that is available for difficult situations.  Security & behavioral health team up to help across the hospital when a patient becomes a danger to themselves or others.  And security is quick to respond when a situation arises that doesn't involve a patient.  Housekeeping and maintenance are quick to respond 24 hours a day to any page they receive.  As a nurse, all of these departments make it possible for me to do my job to the best of my ability and to know there are resources available when I need them.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of a great resource, the nursing department formed a Rapid Response team several years ago.  This is a team of highly trained nurses and respiratory therapists that can be called to the bedside across the hospital to respond to situations in which the bedside nurse has questions or concerns about the patient's condition.  Because of this team, we've been able to get these patients transferred off of a medical unit and to the ICU quicker and with better hand-off communication.  \r\n\r\nAt Abbott, as a nurse, you'll never feel alone!  We welcome new grads as well as nurses with varied levels of experience.  And, management is willing to work with you.  We have several different shifts available from casual positions to full time positions around the clock!  When I graduated from nursing school 2 years ago, there wasn't another hospital that I wanted to work for.  I love Abbott and wouldn't trade it for the world.  There is always room to grow and improve yourself.  Just this year, Abbott rolled out a \"be fit\" wellness program that didn't just focus on physical health, but rather the health of your whole being.  Financial health, mental health, work-life balance, and physical health were all included.  Employees saw improvement in some areas and new initiatives in others.  This is a program that will be carried into 2009 and truly transform our staff into being the best role models for our patients that we can be.  Again, just another way that ANW is at the forefront of employers.\r\n\r\nThings to watch for:  check out the \"backyard initiative\", community giving campaign, and all the medical research being done at ANW.", "cons": "Abbott is located in the heart of the Twin Cities.  For most of us, that means a commute through traffic in the morning, either going to work or going home.  And, while security does their best to secure the hospital grounds as a safe place, crime is still an issue in the area.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge volume of patients and family that visits the hospital each and every day as well as a large staff on each shift.  It can be somewhat daunting at first.\r\n\r\nWe are not a level-1 trauma center, but we are a level-1 heart and stroke center."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "RN Cardiac ICU and Telemetry", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Aug 2020", "job_title": "RN Staff Nurse in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Diverse patient population in terms of medical conditions as well as cultural backgrounds & socioeconomic situations\r\n- Excellent learning opportunities related to partnership with the Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation & its physicians\r\n- Many resources for nurses to utilize in patient care; materials almost always in plentiful supply\r\n- Nurses are both allowed and encouraged to practice to the full extent of their scope, knowledge, training and abilities.\r\n- Pay is good, shift differentials are competitive", "cons": "- No short-term disability coverage for registered nurses \r\n- Unit had a lot of turnover and young staff overall; many were not supportive & caring coworkers in terms of providing feedback for improvement & growth in nursing skills & knowledge\r\n-As management on the unit changed, shortly after I began my transition from telemetry to ICU, with the new manager I noticed that I was not valued as a person or as an employee. When I gave my notice that I was leaving, I only knew my managers had received my letter of resignation because I was taken off of the schedule after my end date. There was no direct acknowledgment of my resignation, and I was told by several coworkers who left around the same time that they experienced this also\r\n- Exit interviews are not standard practice, with direct supervisors or with HR. I had to request an exit interview with HR in order to discuss the problems I felt made the work environment unhealthy for nurses and potentially posed a risk to patients. \r\n- You can see on the unit when you start that you won't be taught new skills or trained on more advanced therapies for a long time. Most people- across shifts, 8s or 12s, D/E/N, will wait years for management to set up training in more advanced therapies (like ECMO, CRRT/CVVHD, therapeutic hypothermia (aka 'targeted temperature management' for cardiac arrest survivors), and open heart phase 1 recovery. While there's something to be said for making sure people are ready to take on these more complex patients, it's also detrimental to the staff who are trained to do these treatments because they burn out faster and become overworked since so few nurses are trained to care for the sickest patients at this the largest private hospital in the Twin Cities.\r\n\r\nScheduling is a disaster; the union scheduling contract is often flagrantly violated and make changes after the 'final' schedule is posted, they also schedule night shift workers with random days on in a stretch of days off, or a night off in between two nights on (then the one night off) and another night on."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Overall, a good employer.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Aug 2009", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Top management works hard to engage employees.
