I've worked for NAU (state government), for the federal government and in the non-profit sector. Of the benefits I received, NAU's were the best in terms of paid leave (both sick and vacation) as well as their retirement matching (both for service professional and classified staff employment categories). The medical insurance was excellent, offering low-cost options on campus which could be optionally paired with large provider networks through BCBS. Of the sectors I have worked in NAU was also hands-down the best about tuition support as they have a tuition waiver with ABOR if you are a full time salaried employee. \r\n\r\nI worked as a systems analyst primarily with web application development and another significant boon was that the team I worked with used modern technologies, was open to innovation and provided considerable opportunities to build skill in enterprise application development with emerging technologies.", "cons": "Though the benefits were so good, I ultimately opted to leave NAU because I did not feel my job was secure. I worked during the \"Cheng administration\", whose MO was to systematically cut resources to university staff and departments while centralizing control across university departments under the university president. For that reason during my time working as a student and staff member for 6 years at NAU there was consistent, widespread upheaval and dissatisfaction across the university both from students and staff. When I became salaried staff as a service professional, the president had to \"personally sign\" a contract renewing my service every 6 months though I was considered a fully salaried employee of the university. Furthermore, although working for this sector would seem to imply a better work-life balance than private industry, the resource cutting led to staff routinely working unpaid overtime hours to make up for under-staffing. I knew some people in my office were sometimes working as much as 80 hours per week. I came to feel that 6 month contract renewing and chronic understaffing did not bode well and I left NAU. I believe that this was an administration-specific problem but I did not want to hold out for an administration change. \r\n\r\nSome other cons are that in general salary does not match cost of living in Flagstaff (somewhat low). This has impacts to the community as NAU is the largest employer, thereby setting a generally low bar for income in Flagstaff. Furthermore, there is little movement in promotion potential. Whereas you might be able to \"move up\" within 2-3 years in some organizations I felt I was likely to have to wait 5-7 years or diversify and leave my team for promotion."}, {"Recommended": "Yes",

This is hard to navigate because there are so few employees in the State Office of Arizona GEAR UP. One of the mangers is the director's best friend and that's like having 2 bosses. \r\n\r\nMy first year was a training year but no one let me do my job because they're control freaks. I brought it up to my supervisor at my annual evaluation and he said he knew and to just roll with it. Thankfully, I left after 2.5 years because I was being bullied by half the managers and it was becoming ugly. They started tricking me and stealing my belongings out of my receptionist's desk in an effort to get me to quit. I never responded hate with hate. I think most of this was in part because I found out they were mis-spending federal grant money. They were trying to bait me into saying or doing something against policy or get me fired so I'd look like a disgruntled employee. They replaced me NOT with another admin asst but a data entry specialist. Their financial manager left soon after I did and I think it was because of this misuse of funds. \r\n\r\nThe State of AZ forces you into their retirement & medical insurance programs, so, potentially, a large part of your paycheck goes towards this.\r\n\r\nThe North Valley Campus is depressing. \r\n\r\nThe staff on this campus engage in gossip like they've got nothing better to do."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good employer with great benefits.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "8 Jul 2014", "job_title": "Support Systems Analyst in Flagstaff, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work environment is generally less stressful and with a more relaxed atmosphere than many corporate jobs.
