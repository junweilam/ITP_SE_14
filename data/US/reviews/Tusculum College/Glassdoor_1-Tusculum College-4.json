Over 150 football athletes are recruited each fall with tremendous turnover in the spring. Most students just end up in massive debt.\r\n\r\nThe current president fired many upstanding faculty and staff to hire his friends from his former institutions. He's hoping his pipe dream programs are going to make him look like a hero, but most faculty believe he's doomed the university. Faculty morale is in the toilet. No raises for the three years I was an employee. Because of that, most faculty are lazy and only do enough to get by. \r\n\r\nSeveral accreditation programs are going through or are complete that are, more or less, works of fiction. Faculty turnover is bad. Most are recruited with huge promises, realize what's going on and get out as soon as possible, leaving only those who cannot find jobs anywhere else. There are a lot of faculty and staff who have been promoted to incompetence. \r\n\r\nProspective faculty, staff, and students should look elsewhere.
