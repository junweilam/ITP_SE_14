I understand that Hall Directors are pretty low in the organizational chart, but there was a constant level of condescension and lack of caring that made the department culture miserable. Students were Hall Directors at one time and a parental culture of  \"do and don't question\"  and a lack of being treated as a professional very much  still exists  The majority of decisions are made  without input and  handed down in the middle of the week. Any suggestions or questioning of practices is discouraged. Assistant Directors even split up professional staffs for meetings because in their words: \"they felt threatened\". As a whole, communication is inconsistent, secretive and usually comes as a mandate. I've heard \"I need XYZ\" by the end of the day\" on many occasions and have been sent scrambling to complete tasks at a moment's notice .  Residence Life comes with su[roses and unexpected moments but many times I've been sent running by disorganization and demands instead of a ringing duty phone. Training for students and staff, when it does exist,  is highly unorganized and little time is put in.  A culture very much exists of \"my way or the highway\" when it comes to the Director and he rarely communicates with Hall Directors. There is a high resistance to anything new or technologically related and a priority is made to keep anything as cheap as possible.  Lastly, work life balance isn't valued. RAs are permitted to call you personally ( not the duty phone) whenever the have an issue and you are required to respond to your building 24/7.
