I would be told to allow myself to be disrespected if it was my supervisor who was disrespecting me, because he was a man and he was going NOWHERE FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO STAY THERE. That man whom I reported on a daily basis continues to verbally assault the other female employees because he feels entitled to do so.
