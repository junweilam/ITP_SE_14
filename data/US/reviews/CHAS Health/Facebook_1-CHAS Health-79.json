None of the management have attended more than highschool so if that tells you anything.

But they will keep the employees who are getting hippa violation after hippa violation. They keep those employees AND give them raises and promotions. They do this because management doesn\u2019t want to handle the issues themselves so they keep passing the problem to other departments. CHAS is based off grants etc tax payer money and other avenues. And I can tell you from experience that your money is being wasted. Half the time they create roles that don\u2019t do anything to give their friends a promotion and job. So most the time these people are standing around talking, online shopping, or just causing problems. The people are sneaky and conniving. It\u2019s like highschool all over again - but with people only having graduated from highschool one should not be surprised of that. The managers and supervisors and admin are lazy. From the lowest man on the totem pole. The people on the floor are working the hardest and getting the least compensation.
