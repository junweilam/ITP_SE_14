Co-employees are friendly.", "cons": "What I find to be a con, you may like, so here goes:\r\n- Interview - I had a gang interview with several \"supervisors\" and one \"manager\" in the room. They read questions from a paper and then wrote down my answers. Very unprofessional and stressful. If they don't write down what you say and how they respond to you, they will later deny it ever came up (i.e. salary requirements.)\r\n- Job Offer - They waited 3 MONTHS to offer me the job. Then they lowballed me. When I reminded them of the salary requirements during the interview, they denied they ever agreed to them. I found out later that several other employees were also lowballed and had to wait months for an offer. I guess they figure if you're still out of work, you're desperate and you'll take anything. Which I, like a sucker, did. Very bad way to start out a new job. And the job offer comes like this - the salary is $XX.XX per hour, final offer, take it or leave it. Very nasty way to make an offer, IMO.\r\n- Exempt / Hourly / Per-Diem - Be VERY CAREFUL when getting hired that you know which classification they put you in. I thought I was going to be \"Exempt,\" but when the offer came in \"hourly,\" I was like - wait, what? Here's why - they want you to document every single little thing you do to justify each and every minute of every hour. Make a business phone call? Write it down (i.e., called hospital, 3 minutes.) Type an email? Write it down. (i.e. typed email to XYZ Hospital - 4 minutes.) Get the picture? Can you say MICRO-MANAGEMENT??? And co-workers with the same job title told me they typically had to work 12 hours a day just to be able to document 8 hours of billable time. Sounds like a Labor Standards violation to me.\r\n- Parking - You have to pay for your own parking. Not only is it an ordeal to drive in extreme rush hour traffic to downtown L.A. every day, with a 8:30 AM non-flexible start time, but then you have to pay for your own parking in their lot for the luxury of working there.\r\n- Health Insurance - SUCKS! I mean, what? They ARE a health Insurance Company!!! But they don't even offer their own plans to employees! If you are single, it's not too expensive, but if you have a family, count on $700+ per month out of your paycheck for a decent Blue Cross HMO or Kaiser.  This was WAY TO EXPENSIVE for me, as I was lowballed in salary (see above.)\r\n- Training - All new employees must attend their mandatory 3 day training class in the \"company\" (not actual job training) before ever setting foot in their actual job. What a waste. So if you don't like the job (as I didn't), you wasted all that training time for nothing. I think it would be better to have employees attend that training after their first week or two on the job, to eliminate all the folks that will quit when finding out their job sucks.\r\n- After company training - No one gave me instructions. I didn't know where to go. I showed up for work, and no one knew where I should sit, who my manager was, or what I was supposed to do. No computer ready for me, no desk. And the people who interviewed me were all out of the office. The on-the job training was by co-employees with the same job title who kept telling me how much they hated their job and complained about everything company related. Way to start a new employee out!.\r\n- Environment - Cubicles are tightly packed around each and every floor, with supervisors constantly seeing what you are doing 24/7. You can hear a pin drop, or a fart from 5 cubicles away. Employees are scared to talk. People whispered on the phone. You could hear keyboard keys from 3 cubicles over. Seriously, it is the quietest work environment I have ever been in in my life. To some folks, this may be a plus. But to me, it was enough to drive you insane. I heard that the folks in the customer service building were very loud (obviously), and also the IT department, but where I was, crickets. Not for me. Felt like a slave. Every time I went to the bathroom, everyone knew. I need a bit more freedom, sorry.\r\n- The job itself - Much different than what I was told it would be on the interview. I felt like the actual job was much worse, and they knew it, so they hid the details in their advert and the interview. To me, it was a bait and switch. \r\n- Quitting - No one cares. No exit interview, no one from HR called to see why I quit. Maybe if someone called and I said all of this to them instead of typing it here, they could have implemented changes so new employee turnover is not so high. Have you noticed - they don't even respond to these bad reviews on Glassdoor? That should tell you something."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Eligibility technician", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Authorization Clerk in Monrovia, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Busy environment,  makes day go much faster.

Most times it\u2019s repetitive and not a lot of work per individual, which leave employees bored out of their mind. They promote employees internally to high impact positions, even though the person doesn\u2019t know how to do the job (remember they don\u2019t train properly), this results in that person in a high impact position doing poor work making it harder for other employees to carry out theirs.
