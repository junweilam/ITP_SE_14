As a HACC student, I know that some instructors require students to go to the Learning Center and get a signature for an assignment.  It seemed to me that some instructors also sent students to the Learning Center rather than teaching them properly.  Student tutors are not instructors, neither in education levels nor in pay.  It actually seemed as if these instructors were trying to prove that the Learning Center (and the library) is worth funding, and so they forced students to go there.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of tech problems -- IT was in the Learning Center fixing problems more often than should be required.  The computers and the printer would randomly have issues.  I know that one day during finals the printers in both the Learning Center and the library were down.  Two of us wanted to print additional notes for an open-book test and could not because of the tech problems."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Negative employees - finance dept", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Harrisburg, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance, decent pay, and tuition assistance.
