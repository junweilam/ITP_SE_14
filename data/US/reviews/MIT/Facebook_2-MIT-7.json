Out of 10, I give their administrative processes and oversight a 4. DLC's (department, labs and centers) follow their own processes and central HR directs close to nothing on an institutional level (i.e. central HR does not require that all areas use the same process for collecting references (mine were actually never checked), background checks, annual review increases, etc.). - Folks who have no business being promoted are frequently promoted. This exists everywhere but I have never seen it to the extent that it exists at MIT. I.e. The senior HR leader for the school told me to offer lower than what HR compensation approved because everyone negotiates (this is a legal issue because only basing salary on negotiation is harmful to the salary gap as males are historically more likely to negotiate). I of course did not do this, but from what I understand other DLC\u2019s in the school do. This person was recently promoted to an even higher-level position. - Be aware of who you are talking to when asking current employees how they like working at MIT. If you are talking to someone who has been at MIT for over 15 years as apposed to someone who has been there for 3 years.

Everyone got in for a reason; they\u2019re smart and excited about something.

Want to take grad classes in your first semester? (I did, it was fine.) Want to take ten classes this semester? (I did not, but you can.) This is a double-edged sword, btw.\r\nThere\u2019s a strong culture of getting undergrads involved in research. Real research too, not just washing dishes and doing gruntwork. If science is something that interests you, that\u2019s a big leg up for grad school.\r\nThe alumni network is the real deal. I got my first job out of college because my boss was an alum; he knew exactly what my training was and what I was capable of, so he hired me on the spot. Connections I made on that job are probably getting me my first job out of grad school too. What you know is important, but who you know matters an awful lot too. Also, \u201cnobody gets fired for buying IBM\u201d\u2026or hiring MIT alums. It\u2019s a name brand, and that counts.", "cons": "There are more resources than you could possibly take advantage of, and nobody to tell you no. MIT students tend towards the overambitious and excitable - they take on too much, and then burn out. I did too, it happens.\r\nThe above is exacerbated by the \u201chardcore\u201d culture of MIT. I think it comes from most of us having an easy ride through school - there\u2019s no honor in getting an A on a test when you\u2019ve got a pack of morons setting the curve. The honor comes from doing it with style. So there\u2019s an idolization of truly awful work habits. The person who plays Warcraft for 20 hours/day while taking a full courseload is far more elite than someone who has the life management skills to finish their work and then go to bed at a civilized hour. It took me entirely too long to realize just how wrongheaded this is.\r\nThe damage is compounded by MIT\u2019s terrible handling of mental health issues. If they suspect you\u2019re depressed, they will find a way to kick you out of school. (They\u2019ve lost several multi-million dollar lawsuits over people killing themselves on campus. If they kick you out, your suicide costs them nothing.) This is true of many elite schools, but MIT is notorious, and a pioneer of the practice.\r\nFor grad school, it\u2019s worth noting that MIT professors are\u2026perhaps not ideal for beginners. They can recruit anyone they want, so the full professors tend to be stars who run mega-labs. That\u2019s not the worst, but it\u2019s easy to slip through the cracks. Also, some of them have gigantic egos, and if they don\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough\u2026I have stories, trust me. One professor, among other things, came up to my parents at graduation and expressed surprise at my having gotten a job. (Bless my mother, the insult went right over her head, and she happily chirped away about my new job until the professor stomped off. It was beautiful.) I\u2019d gotten a B in this person\u2019s class - no excuses, I\u2019d badly overloaded myself that semester - and they\u2019d been out to get me ever since. Wasn\u2019t just me, either; as I said, I have stories.\r\nThe junior professors are, if anything, more dangerous for naive and unwary grad students. As I said, MIT can recruit anyone; they don\u2019t really hire junior profs because they plan to keep them. Instead, they hire for what amounts to a seven-year fellowship, where MIT gets its name in press releases about bleeding-edge science (read: stuff that probably won\u2019t be reduced to practice in the course of a normal-length PhD), and the professor gets top-notch resources and talent, such that in seven years\u2019 time (with good luck) they might have proof-of-concept data that would interest a good school (maybe UMich or Cornell, but not MIT) in hiring this person for a real job. If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into, and don\u2019t have the skills and experience to carve out a \u201cbread and butter\u201d project in addition to the crazy moon-shot stuff\u2026there are a lot of long PhDs, given the quality of the entering students.\r\nThis is by no means specific to MIT, but if you can get into MIT, you can probably get a large scholarship at a very solid school.

You have a lot of flexibility to choose when to work, but of course there is a lot to do. Especially when collaborating with researchers and students the hours can get wonky, particularly near deadlines. There is little distinguishing of evenings, weekends, holidays, etc. as \"sacred\" time, but there is also the assumption that you will use your own discretion for giving yourself fair downtime as needed. I personally welcome this flexibility as it respects your own time management style as long as you're getting things done.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, everybody here is highly motivated. You don't come to MIT for the paycheck -- you come for the exchange of ideas and amazing learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nAs an employee you have the chance to sign up for courses at MIT provided they are relevant for the job.

In the middle of a recession, undoubtedly there were recipients in the division whose families have been directly, perhaps painfully, affected by the economic downturn.

Consequently, they should be able to work in an environment that supports them and their growth.  The organization has a long way to go in that respect.

A fiercely internally competitive culture retards successful collaboration, and the 'what's  in it for me' attitude prevails because it is rewarded.

The differences between what's actually done at MIT and what's done elsewhere are smaller than might be imagined, but the profs here excel at salesmanship above all else. When you talk to people involved in student startups, and drill down to the specifics of what they're doing, you often find they're based on fundamentally flawed concepts. These people aren't being willfully dishonest, they've just succumbed to delusion and it can be heartbreaking to see when you consider the resources at their disposal to figure things out.\r\n\r\nMore Exploitative than Anticipated\r\nIf you're going to grad school, you basically accept that you're signing yourself into indentured servitude in exchange for apprenticeship. The trouble is that it turns out it's not really apprenticeship at all. Most of the labs here are run like idea farms for the benefit of the career and reputation of your prof, often with little to no meaningful input or guidance from him or her. This can be especially true if your prof has acquired you to do things outside his or her area of expertise. Independence is great, but feeling deeply accountable for the quality of something that someone else is taking credit for can be a tough pill to swallow year after year. Some profs adopt strategies for maximum short term output from their labs that can be pretty brutal on everyone involved (including them). \r\n\r\nCounterproductive Competition (occasionally)\r\nMost people here are great, but there's a small subset that are pathological narcissists skilled exclusively in using others to accomplish their aims, meanwhile reassuring themselves and others of their inherent superiority. This is an unfortunate byproduct of the prestige of the institution--it attracts these types and they can't be easily recognized from a CV or an interview. All I can say is that if you've developed useful capability, you need to be wary that you aren't being manipulated or sabotaged; these things happen. Don't let it prevent you from interacting, but you have to always keep on guard in the back of your mind.
