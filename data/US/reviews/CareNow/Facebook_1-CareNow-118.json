It used to heavily center around patient care and doing what's best for the patient. Now all they care about are numbers. Patients are just figures on a gauge. Bonuses are all providers care about. \r\n\r\nIf you have a family, you'll never see them. Carenow refuses to work with your schedule. It even sent out a memo recently that basically said you can request time off, or give schedule preferences, but it won't be honored and pto can be denied for any reason. I've had to put off going back to school for three semesters because carenow won't work with me. \r\n\r\nThe rules and policies constantly change. You get yelled at constantly for breaking rules you had no idea existed, because they were just created that day. They can't make their minds up about anything. \r\n\r\nI don't know about other positions, but front desk is underpaid. They try to make up for it by having differential payment on certain shifts but it still doesn't make up what you're losing. And forget about overtime. I had 3 hours of overtime on my last check so they cut my hours this week. If you pick up a shift at another clinic your hours will get cut at your home clinic to get you as few hours as possible. \r\n\r\nSeverely, painfully understaffed. When asking management why we cant get additional coverage on very busy days, we were told that we get \"lazy\" when there's adequate coverage. Which is wholly untrue. Just because your staff isn't running around losing their minds does not mean they are lazy. They can't keep employees and the turnover rate is huge. I've been with Carenow for 16 months and not once in that time has my front desk been adequately staffed to meet patient need. I often have to stay an hour and a half to two hours after my shift multiple days a week just to get what needs to be done, done. They expect us to do too much in too little time. Furthermore, this year they decided to make a new position at the corporate office, so one person makes the schedules for all of the patient reps in the whole division instead of allowing it to be on a clinic to clinic basis like it always has been, and it's resulted in chaos. There are so many open shifts, they have no idea what they're doing because they weren't carenow employees, they are outside hires so they have no clue how the scheduling should work. \r\n\r\nThe equipment is ALWAYS malfunctioning. They have started buying clinics these copier/scanners that don't scan. They'll act like they scan but the information doesn't get sent, which negatively affects us because then we get a 500 chart list of charts that need to be found, pulled, rescanned, out back together, and put away. The computers break down constantly and are so, so painfully slow. Yell at us about efficiency all you want but we can only go as fast as our computer. The id/insurance scanners don't work and are also so slow it's faster and more reliable to make a photocopy on the barely functional copier.  \r\n\r\nFront desk employees are treated with very little respect. They have a positive/negative log which keeps track of the employees, but I have never once seen a positive written down. They only care about the negative. You can have the best costumer service in the world and be praised by multitudes of patients, but that will never get written down. Few minutes late? You can bet it's logged even if it's in the \"grace period\" you have to be considered on time. \r\n\r\nThe company is so concentrated on expanding that they let the clinics they already have go completely ignored.

But still always running out of supplies! \nIncredibly low morale due to constant high expectations. Work comp, employee health- drug screens/physicals, urgent care walk-ins, and Covid tests out the wazoo!  Trying to keep the visit, and wait times at a minimum (under 45min from door to door), but volumes up, doesn't make sense. One is going to suffer. We are humans, and for quality care, things take time. You can't have both every minute of every day.  Add in the fact that Covid tests are coming in from web check-in, telehealth, and walk-in daily, what do you expect?! Thankfully, often times there will be an front desk, MA, and RT working, but RT's don't help the MA's much, and are thrown into the front desk here and there with very little training. Ridiculous demands.\nHCA has a history of treating their employees awfully, blatant lies, and shady dealings with the pay you work hard to earn. I'd do yourself a favor, and keep looking.
