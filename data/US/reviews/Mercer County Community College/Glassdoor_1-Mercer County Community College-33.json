A vote of \"no confidence\" in the Board by full-time faculty has been rumored for some time. These votes have no teeth, however. Business as usual will probably result. Just like the vote of \"no confidence\" in the now disgraced College President.\r\n\r\nThe College President was just escorted off campus by security for wrongdoings after a months-long investigation. A new President begins in two months.\r\n\r\nEach of the VPs need administrative assistants at $40k-$60k. Some VPs even have two assistants to keep up on their tik tock and facebook game. All of the VPs get to work from home and have the administrative assistants do most of the work, as with the Divisional Deans. \r\n\r\nMany of the Divisional Deans are either hands-off or micromanagers or managing in absentia, showing up on campus maybe once per month with rumors of other full time jobs in addition to high-paying MCCC jobs.\r\n\r\nGROSS NEPOTISM/CRONYISM - Members of the MCCC college board of trustees have repeatedly had friends and relatives hired to full time, high paying internal positions, even when there are better candidates. These positions are all $100k-$200k+ jobs.\r\n\r\nADJUNCT MISTREATMENT - The administration has a belief that it doesn't matter if you mistreat adjunct faculty.  \"Adjuncts are like Kleenex - use one up, get a new one\" was even stated publicly at a full-time faculty meeting by one of the former Vice Presidents of Academic Affairs.\r\n\r\nLACK OF ADVANCEMENT - Promises of full-time employment for adjunct teaching professionals are usually lies. The College has the current belief that attrition will drive full-time faculty down to 30 or so with an adjunct pool of hundreds. Don't believe the lies that a tenured faculty individual is going to be retiring soon and replaced. Most are not going to be replaced. But they will still dangle the prospect of full-time work to adjunct faculty.\r\n\r\nAll of this is done to help the bottom line of the college which is struggling with low enrollment. However, they keep adding more Vice Presidents almost monthly with high salaries. \r\n\r\nLOW ADJUNCT PAY / LACK OF RESPECT- Most adjunct faculty can only make a total of approximately $25k per year at MCCC even though the salary per hour is high. Although adjuncts make over $60/hour, they are precluded from working more than nine hours total. \r\n\r\nAdministrative professionals start at $40k-$60k. Most of the staff positions start at $40k-$60k. They will gladly hire more full time staff, but not promote adjuncts to full time faculty.\r\n\r\nThe pay disparity and lack of respect from the VP level and above - where adjuncts are viewed with contempt - is well known.\r\n\r\nPOOR COMMUNICATION - Inter-departmental support from IT, maintenance, and facilities is relatively poor. They have no processes in place for industry-accepted infrastructure management. No one double checks if things are OK and working. Everything goes through the \"schooldude\" website, on a first-come, first-served basis - when they get to it. Yet things are still rarely completely correct once completed, with a lack of follow-through.\r\n\r\nLACK OF COOPERATION - The board of trustees, the former College President, and VPs view the relationship with all faculty as antagonistic rather than cooperative. If the end goal is good learning outcomes and a positive environment, why make each conversation an argument? Shouldn't everyone have the same goals?"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "go somewhere else", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Security Officer (Full-time) in West Windsor, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "you don't do much, good benefits.", "cons": "bad pay, boring... very boring."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Reducing reliability", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Head Lifeguard in Hamilton, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I got my certification and my baseline requirements to move forward with my bachelor's degree here, as well as more experience in customer relations, my program of study, and progression towards my degree for less with tuition reimbursement.
