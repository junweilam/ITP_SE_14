The senior administration tries to get faculty to funnel their research into niche tech areas (almost completely sidelining the liberal arts) because these areas bring in quick money and have short-run, superficial \"impact\" (really, it seems to be mainly about flashy visibility in the news). They keep buying new campuses and buying people from other institutions instead of fully supporting existing faculty and enriching the learning experience in Boston.  To pay for all the new campuses they have increased the number of students paying tuition to the point where all of the students who apply to go to Northeastern in Boston cannot actually all be in Boston during the course of their undergrad careers.  First, they doubled up students in the dorms, and now a significant number of students will be forced to be at another \"campus\" location during part of their degrees (branded as \"mobility\").

Meetings are scheduled over your lunch, and you are encouraged not to go out of the office for lunch. I've had the worst onboarding experience of my life, where months of old work were piled up for me to find on day 1 of my employment. I wasn't allowed the time to properly do any mandatory trainings, and it took almost a month to get access to software that I needed to do my job because my boss was unbelievably negligent. The practice and overall style of management in that office is extremely outdated, including their software and technology. Leadership is old, and only interested in doing things one way, and one way only. There is zero creativity. Leadership talks down to you, and you work for them, not with them. They lied about the hybrid expectation during the interview, stating it was flexible 1-2 in office, then pulled a hook line and sinker requiring me to be in office everyday. I wasn't allowed to have focus time on my calendar, I was told by my boss that I needed to be available at all times. My boss was very inconsiderate of people's time, she would drop sudden teams calls constantly checking in anytime I was granted a work from home day, after begging.

(See below for con on this point).", "cons": "\u2022 Lack of training and organization\u2014especially for adjunct faculty. Unless you had pre-existing relationships with existing faculty I could see it being incredibly hard to understand your responsibilities and how your courses fit into the overall curriculum.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Despite being encouraged to help students with extra-curricular activities, there were massive managerial failures at the senior leadership level surrounding the program, expectations, compensation, etc. Often it was a game of \"he-said, she-said\" that was frustrating for me\u2014but more importantly, for students. It looks like this inefficiency has been improved since, but I think it's a big problem for the college. \r\n\r\n\u2022 My advice for other adjuncts in particular: ask lots of questions, get involved in the community, and document everything in writing. If you go above and beyond, I truly believe the school will reward you for it, but you need to watch out for yourself because of the lack of organization and shuffle of responsibility. Make sure you're speaking to a decision maker and have documentation of expectations, and you'll be set."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life
