There is very little opportunity for advancement unless you become licensed. I will say that the worst roles in this organization are, patient service rep, MA, call center, medical records.  The work life balance does not exist.  Schedule s can change daily, you think you can leave at one time but cant.  10 and 12 hr days are not uncommon. When you close is when last patient leaves.  Last patients are often critical and you can stay 1- 2 hours later just waiting for a last patient to make a followup appt. You are expected to help other areas when short handed plus handle incoming patients for 5-7 Drs. and possibly dental, BHS, Insurance, and other services providers. Patients are rude and expect you to always accomodate them, regardless if they respond to your request for information. Patients take complete advantage of HB. Many have no ID, Ins, copay, wont complete documentation and if you question them, they will file a complaint on you. Again the PSR role is the worst. Managers will bully you.  Some workers do ok. Others dont. Drs rule. Try it, if you like it, stay. If not leave.
