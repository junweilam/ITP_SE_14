Their 401K is NOT matched., AT ALL Organization is somewhat disorganized. There are some CNA's that as an RN you cannot deped on and dread sharing patients with. Some CNA's even hide to avoid work and ignore calls requesting thier assitance on the walkie. A lot of registry RNs and registry CNA's because they find better opportunites or just simply burnout. Doctors have RN's enter their orders, even if they are sitting in front of a computer.  Patient population is horrid, lots of psych, homeless, and drug seeking frequent flyer patients. Annual pay increase is a joke, less than $1, if even that. Management can be clicky with favorites. Cafeteria closed on weekeneds and closes at 1:30 on weekdays. Often short staffed and sitters not avaiable for patient's that need them. Often times RN's end up with \"primary\" patients in which the RN is resonsible for RN and CNA duties. Out of the two nursing stations only one of them has a monitor tech who also answers phone calls and patient call-lights. At the other nursing station the RN's are left having to answer the patient call-light calls and the phone."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Unhealthy and Nasty Place to Work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 May 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Tustin, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some staff are good.
