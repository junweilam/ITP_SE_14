The administration, management & HR are the worst I have ever experienced throughout my 18 years of working there. If you have serious concerns regarding workplace harassment or bullying, they will not care or support your concerns; they will support the bullies & allow them to continue to work without any consequences. During the coronavirus pandemic, the new CEO has decided to take away everyone\u2019s scheduled vacation time - no other hospitals in the area have done so. We were told by management we cannot refuse to care of coronavirus positive patients - there are many healthcare workers that have serious health issues - asthma, immunocompromised, battling cancers & going through chemo. Making them work with these patients could literally kill them. \nSo management & this new administration are treating all of their workers without any regard or sympathy toward them. It\u2019s never been this bad as it is right now.\nAlso, the benefits are awful. We don\u2019t have separate sick & vacation time; we accumulate very few vacation/sick time hours every 2 weeks. If you are pregnant, you have to use 2 weeks of your accrued vacation time & then if you qualify for short term disability, you only get paid 60% of your salary for only 4 weeks despite, for example, if you have C-section & according to doctor\u2019s orders cannot return to work for 8 weeks - they will still only pay for 4 weeks. If you have surgery & need to be off work, you have to use all of your vacation hours - there isn\u2019t an option to not use vacation hours if you don\u2019t want to. And health insurance is really bad - luckily I am able to get it through my husband\u2019s work. \nOne more con - many units within the hospital are old & outdated; many work areas are unsafe & hazardous to work in. Most inpatient rooms are not private & very small. The hospital decided to invest lots of money into building many new clinics while ignoring the extremely outdated patient floors, ER, procedural areas."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great, friendly environment.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Rockford, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I greatly enjoyed the friendship that grew among my co-workers.
