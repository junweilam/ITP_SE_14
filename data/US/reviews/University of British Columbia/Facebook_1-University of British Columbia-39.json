Expense reports expected to be done weekly (and part of performance review) - I was lucky to get them done every 3 weeks.  Lack of empathy or understanding from management. No support whatsoever.  Do NOT accept a bonus from this company - when you leave by month 5 you will need to pay it back. Short term disability does not kick in until after you've been there a year, fyi.  Consistently worked 50 - 60 hours a week without management taking notice or realizing that workload was too heavy. Many colleagues worked on the weekends to try to keep up, but there was no way to keep up.  When you leave the company, the benefits you waited 2 months for will end the weekend after you leave - not until the end of the month like so many other companies."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Working at UbC", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Resources, community, connections, beautiful, educational", "cons": "There is nothing to complain about at a world class university."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "TA / RA", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Assistant in Akron, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Department is overall good.
