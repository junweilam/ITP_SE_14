So everyone's experience will be different. But it's a great place for people without degrees to work because there is pretty much unlimited opportunity for advancement if you do good and play your cards right. You don't need a degree to advance high with pres and make a good living. There were lots of managers who got the position the old fashioned way. By just working hard and proving themselves.\r\n\r\nMy skill set is in logistics... I started as a central supply tech at Rust making $16.50 an hour. After three years and two promotions I'm sitting at $20 an hour. There is so much room to grow if you apply yourself and don't start drama.\r\n\r\nA lot of what you experience comes down to the kind of management you have. When I first started I had a terrible and abusive supervisor who bullied, talked down to and berated the staff. But the staff went to HR and HR got rid of that supervisor very quickly after an investigation. They take that stuff seriously... Which is wonderful. The new supervisor that was transferred in was a great guy who didn't hold the staff back and encouraged growth.\r\n\r\nThe culture at Presbyterian is refreshing. HR is scary effective at rooting out abusive or bad managers which makes it an ideal place to work for those looking to start a career. They genuinely seem to care about the staff and they give regular raises... They will even give all staff things like $2000 bonuses and an extra 40 hours of PTO out of the blue. Presbyterian wants to be competitive... And they are not afraid to spend money to be that way.\r\n\r\nWork/life balance is great in every area I've worked in. There would sometimes be pressure to do OT but it was never forced on you. The supervisor I had understood and accommodated the needs of staff with family. I don't think I've ever had a day off denied while at Presbyterian. But I know it's different for clinical staff from what I've heard.\r\n\r\nAs for pay... It's fair and genuinely competitive for support staff from what I've seen. One thing to keep in mind is that pay is exclusively based on experience listed on your resume. So make sure it's all listed. I use two resumes at Presbyterian. One of them is short and pretty to get the attention of hiring managers. The other is less pretty but has every bit of experience I have itemized so HR will give me the pay I deserve. I recommend you do the same.\r\n\r\nOverall I'm happy at Presbyterian. I'm treated with respect, the work is rewarding, I'm compensated fairly and I feel like I'm in control of my career with very few barriers to achieving my goals.\r\n\r\nI spent 10 years working a dead end logistics job with little room for advancement. And it feels like I wasted a decade of my life there. I don't feel that way about Presbyterian. My only regret is that I didn't join earlier.", "cons": "It's not all good... But you are generally able to effect change to fix the things that aren't good if you keep a level head and act in good faith. Just remember that pay is almost exclusively based on the experience listed on your resume. So get that resume right."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good Start", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Albuquerque, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits were great and helpful.", "cons": "At times units was short-staffed."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Aug 2022", "job_title": "RN Manager in Espanola, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Co-workers, pay, leadership, patient population, sense of community.", "cons": "PTO, entry level positions are hard to keep filled."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Medical Coder III in Albuquerque, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary, benefits, home/work life balance", "cons": "Difficult to advance, people spend their entire careers here."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good times and bad", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Nurse Technician in Albuquerque, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The unit I worked for felt like family most of the time, lots of opportunity for overtime, cross training etc.", "cons": "Pay seems lower compared to same position at other places."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good people, bad company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Cardiac Monitor Technician in Albuquerque, NM", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- good benefits (note: good not great)\r\n- most coworkers are awesome.

It is hard to get a job here if you do not have an inside person that you are close too. Than if you do get a job here without knowing anyone the team is rude and gang up on you, treats you horribly, leaves you out of things, and makes you feel like an outsider. \r\nThere is no real chance for advancement if you do not know anyone. That means you have to be someone's neighbor, best friend, neighbor, or family member, otherwise you will not have the opportunity to advance. \r\nAlso, the raises are a joke, they are non-existent and they beat around the bush about not giving a raise. Even with nothing but high scores on you annual review there is not a lot of opportunity given or raises for that matter. \r\nThey were having financial issues before being sued and now they are being sued by the Attorney General. They claim that this is all just not true. But the Attorney General is not going to put his reputation on the line just to go after an insurance company that is innocent. Also, if you are being sued for not paying what you should, where is all the money going? Why the financial issues? This is not the first time Presbyterian has decided not to give raises, yet raise the amount of all of our benefits. \r\nThat is another thing, they tell LPN's get your RN, Associate, now they are telling both LPN's and RN-Associates to get there BSN in order to advance and be a manager. To get a BSN costs anywhere from $20,000 to $50,000 and you are not giving raises. So now employees are supposed to go into even more debt to advance, only to not receive a raise. \r\nThat brings me to another aspect, why is it so hard to talk to a Human Resources Representative? They have HR locked up like Fort Knox and if you try to go speak to someone from HR then you get  advised to call AskHR so you call and the person answering doesn't know what to do, so they transfer you to someone else to leave a voicemail, only that HR person does not call you back. Crazy.\r\nBenefits: I came to this organization for benefits and the cost to me keeps going up. When I first got Presbyterian Insurance they had no PCP's to see. It is hard to get seen, even at their UC which will tell you they are at capacity, even if you are really sick or bleeding. So then you ask for a list of covered providers and they do not have one.
