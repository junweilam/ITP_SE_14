If you are scheduled to work a particular weekend and you request PTO over that weekend you are expected to find someone willing to switch a weekend with you. I believe PTO should be yours to take when you want it, without having to get someone else to work for you. They need to find and hire more PRN employees that can just cover when people go on vacation. Also people weirdly don't really work different shifts to cover, like if you are day shift pretty much only day shift can cover for you, even though Evenings or Nights could easily just add a few hours to their day to help cover the gaps. And when an employee has a known upcoming leave of absence (for example a female employee is pregnant and will be having a baby) they don't think ahead or even post the job listing for a replacement or part timer until after the leave of absence begins which means when someone is hired, they're really down two employees because the person training isn't able to get as much work done while they're training."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great people - horrible leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "25 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Boise, ID", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People really want to care for patients.
