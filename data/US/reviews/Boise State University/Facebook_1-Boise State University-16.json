Inconsistent standards for employees The majority of employees have never had a job outside of school, or lived away from their parent's home. This gives them unrealistic expectations and more pride than experience. Zero respect for my initial job title. I accepted temporary responsibilities when my first supervisor left.

Everyone is expected to be a Swiss Army knife worker on the pay that is 20% below market average minimum.
