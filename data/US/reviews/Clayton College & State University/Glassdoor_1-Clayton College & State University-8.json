Working with CSU students was immensely rewarding, as they typically came from under-represented groups and backgrounds. College should be for everyone, and CSU gives hope for that ideal to be realized.", "cons": "What I'm posting below are the responses I gave in my online exit interview. There are a few prompts, followed by my honest responses. -Reason for leaving CSU: My contract has not been renewed, but nobody will tell me why. I suspect foul play and am seeking legal action against the university. -Comments Regarding Your Work and Work Environment: Our workload is higher than that of comparable universities. This has been pointed out empirically to our department chair and dean, but neither seemed to care. The chair decided to form a committee to pursue the topic, I signed up, but the committee never actually formed or met. Colleagues who have been here for decades reported that they\u2019ve complained to the dean about the unfair workload for years, but nobody seems to care or hear. We cannot fulfill our duties to a high standard with the given workload. Meaningful research cannot be done without the support (re: time) required to do so. Quality mentoring of students also takes time, which is in short supply. Teaching so many courses requires a sacrifice in quality, rigor, personal well-being, or some combination thereof. None of this touches on the fact that we are woefully underpaid for our services. I can make more money working an entry-level position (requiring only a BS in biology) as a lab technician at another school. When chances were given to voice opinions about how our department, college, or university could do better, we are often met with obstruction, indifference, or hostility. Maintaining the status quo is the typical message received, and I believe I have been outright retaliated against for pushing us to do better. This is a toxic work environment that rewards compliance and mediocracy. The upper administration will talk about shared governance, but decisions are made for faculty, not with faculty. This was blindingly apparent throughout the response to the pandemic, and continues in our enrollment crisis. One need only look at the administration\u2019s attack on the Faculty Senate to understand the core issue. -Comments Regarding Learning and Development: Our department makes only the smallest token gestures towards the development of its faculty. The chair does not advocate for faculty needs, respond to their biggest concerns, or openly communicate his expectations. Until he was forced to change his practices by the provost, a secret spreadsheet was used in our annual evaluations. We were not allowed to see the spreadsheet, and when I asked why, no reasonable answer could be given. It speaks to a fundamental distrust and indifference towards faculty and sets up an environment where bias, discrimination, and favoritism can run rampant. I was told at all three of my annual reviews that I was doing well, and that I was on track to earn tenure. Now I am going to be unemployed, but not because of any issue with my performance. I was never notified of a shortcoming in teaching, research, or service. Quite the opposite, in fact, as I was told I had one of the highest scores in the department in my last reviews. When you are performing at 678, 758.5, and 779 (out of 800) over three years, what more can be done to show you deserve to continue working in the department? No efforts were made to help me develop further, and no indication was given that further development was needed to keep my job. -Comments Regarding Supervision: My department chair regularly bent or outright broke policies and procedures. Students who did not get a satisfactory grade in my class were allowed to take upper-level courses for which my course was a pre-requisite. Those students repeatedly failed their attempts in the upper-level course. Multiple faculty in the department complained about his override \u201cpolicy,\u201d and when the curriculum committee brough the issue up, he gaslighted them by essentially saying everything was fine and there weren\u2019t any issues. My chair was uncritical of attempts by the dean to interfere with a search for a new faculty member. He communicated the dean\u2019s unethical decisions to the search committee and defended them as legitimate. This involved both disqualifying a candidate before application materials were reviewed and disqualifying a candidate based on where they earned their degree. My chair never treated me fairly. The job description changed upon verbal offer for my position, which I\u2019m sure is against policy, if not outright illegal. I believe I was punished for speaking out about ways to improve the department by being assigned courses I did not desire to teach. Our chair pushed back against the faculty-generated idea of praising us for our research accomplishments. We instead did it ourselves through email and posting of manuscripts on our door. He creates a stifling, oppressive atmosphere. As described previously, I never felt my chair had the progression of my career in mind. No meaningful advice was ever given. He had to have his arm twisted to institute a peer evaluation system for our teaching, but made very little effort to see it through. Faculty signed up to observe each other and complete evaluations, and the chair signed up to observe each faculty member at least once a year. There was no oversight of this program, so, although I provided a thorough and thoughtful review for my colleague, nobody ever did the same for me, and the chair never attended my classroom. My chair resisted attempts by the curriculum committee (of which I was a member for three years and the chair for one of those years) to improve our curriculum. We wanted courses to be structured to provide a pathway for student success, wherein their knowledge would build upon foundations as they progressed from introductory to upper-level courses. The faculty even voted for these changes, but the chair did nothing to institute them. We were once again opposed, stifled, and expected to continue to service the status quo. My chair did come up with a multi-page document to share ideas about how our department could help with the ongoing enrollment crisis. However, though this document was sent to our faculty, it was never discussed at a faculty meaning. The ideas (some of them quite good!) languished in limbo, apparently to the chair\u2019s satisfaction. When a colleague presented empirical data illustrating the decline in enrollment of majors in a foundational course for the major, the chair ignored the presentation and instead spent department meeting time on messages that should have been (and sometimes were) emails. The leadership void was palpable on a daily basis and absolutely suffocating. My chair repeatedly cancelled department meetings without justification, leaving us even more adrift in the sea of missing leadership. One of these cancellations came after I asked my colleagues to support regarding my non-renewal and when a co-worker asked the chair to address rumors circulating in the department. He clearly saw silence and non-engagement with the faculty as the solution to difficult conversations, dodging anything resembling adequate leadership. Our department has seen substantial turnover in the past five or so years. I knew about this when interviewing for the position, and asked my chair for comment. He saw no pattern in the departures of multiple tenure-track (and some tenured!) professors, and did not seem interested in trying to understand what changes could have been made to retain that talent. He told us that the dean is comfortable with a 10% per year turnover in faculty, which is insane. We are a department of ~15, so, on average, we\u2019d be replacing three people every two years? How can we function like that? How will morale be kept up in that environment? When the dean was confronted with these sentiments, he deflected. That was in the same meeting where he could not articulate a plan for what he\u2019s like to accomplish over the next three to five years. Pathetic. -Non-Compliance and Complaints or Issues Comments: My dean asked illegal questions of myself and a colleague during our interviews with him. He asked each of us if we were married, and my colleague was asked if she was planning on having children. My dean told my chair to exclude a job applicant from consideration before their application materials had even been reviewed. My dean rejected the recommendation from a search committee to hire an acceptable candidate, on the basis of the dean not liking where the candidate earned their degree. After filing a formal complaint about the above issues with HR, I received a letter of non-renewal. My department chair was aware of my dissatisfaction with my dean prior to my HR complaint, and I have every reason to believe the two of them worked to eliminate me from this position. When I filed an open records request to understand why my contract was not being renewed, an internal document showed no legitimate reasoning given for my elimination. When I made this document public (it is, by law, the property of any Georgia resident), seeking support from both the AAUP and Faculty Senate, the administration retaliated against the entire Senate. Based on the allegations made by the anonymous complainants, I have every reason to believe that my chair was among them. These are all deeply concerning issues that point to a rot at the heart of the administration. Unfortunately, my chair is getting a promotion now, to be leader of a new, larger academic unit. I\u2019m not religious, but I figuratively pray for the souls of those who will now be under the supervision of my dean and chair. God speed! Bear in mind that my department chair was appointed as chair by the dean, and was not selected by a search committee given the opportunity to fully consider external candidates. My chair is being promoted to director without ever having undergone an evaluation by his faculty, as that process only happens once every five years. Why are faculty evaluated yearly (actually, every semester) by their students, but chairs only evaluated once every five years by their faculty? -Rewards: Our base salary is demonstrably low, and uncompetitive with comparable universities. I did appreciate the willingness to negotiate for a higher starting salary, and the cost-of-living increase from the governor certainly was welcome. There were never any annual increases, despite having to jump through hurdles and a secret spreadsheet (see above) to compete for potential increases. If this is what the university considers a \u201creward system,\u201d it is a joke. The benefits were sufficient. -What did I like most about working at CSU: The potential to make a difference. Working with CSU students was immensely rewarding, as they typically came from under-represented groups and backgrounds. College should be for everyone, and CSU gives hope for that ideal to be realized. -What work-related issues, areas, policies or benefits would you like to see improved? Pay needs to come up to respect the expertise faculty are bringing and actually make CSU competitive with comparable schools. Leadership (deans and chairs) need to be held accountable for the progress, or lack thereof, of their respective units. The university must strive for transparency in its internal workings and function on the principle of shared governance, not simply pay lip service to the term. -Would you consider re-employment at CSU? Why or why not? Never. CSU is a sinking ship, taking on water from the ongoing fallout of the pandemic. The leadership seems content to watch the water level rise instead of bailing it out, or, god forbid, trying to find and repair the hole. -What changes would be required to attract you back to CSU? Clean house. We have a new president, so that\u2019s hopeful. The provost, dean, and chair of biology need to go. Faculty time and expertise need to be valued, both financially and in terms of time. We cannot do our jobs well when we are asked to do so much. This is why so much done at CSU is done poorly or just to a low standard."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Watch out", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 May 2023", "job_title": "Adminstrative Coordinator in Morrow, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting job with good benefits and a good location.", "cons": "Too much depends on your supervisor; a bad supervisor makes a bad job.
