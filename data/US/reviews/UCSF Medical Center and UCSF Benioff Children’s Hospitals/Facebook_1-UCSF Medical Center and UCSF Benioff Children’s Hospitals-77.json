Positions have been open for months and management refuses to consider remote work. Meanwhile there is a steady stream of employees leaving for jobs where they can work hybrid or remotely. \n\nAcross service lines and multiple departments, there is a complete lack of transparency. Management operates based on favoritism. Promotion is based on who you know, not merit. Some people work much harder than others, but are rarely recognized. Unionized jobs means ineffective people stay for years, while good workers get frustrated and leave. The culture is very white, very \"nice,\" and very passive aggressive. Those who don't fit in to this culture are either excluded or targeted. \n\nThere is a lot of talk about \"patient care\" but hardly any social work department funds actually go to meet the real needs of patients and families. There are award ceremonies every year where prizes for \"social justice\" work are distributed. Meanwhile there\u2019s never enough money in the budget for meal cards, hotel vouchers, or parking stickers. Social workers are told to \"conserve resources.\" Parents of pediatric patients are sleeping in their cars and living off free snack bags. Management does not work with the development office to get more funds for families of sick kids. \n\nSocial workers in pediatrics are risk-averse and territorial, always trying to protect themselves at the expense of colleagues and clients. Many staff at BCH have only ever worked at UCSF, so they don't realize that there are better ways to do things. Or maybe this is their last job - a lot are \"lifers\" with no motivation to improve because they are just counting down til retirement. Even those who are willing to try something new or different are scared to speak up because they want to keep their jobs.
