A lot of managers hiring family, Hospital management has allowed an NP to work in their urgent care who also happened to be the wife of a senior executive in the hospital leadership team. Was denied an opportunity to interview for another internal position due to another employee recommending their family member despite the fact that I was more qualified. \nDuring the Snow-pocalypse we had, ALL staff at ALL locations (main hospital, and urgent care clinics) were expected to come in regardless of weather or status of utilities in the facility. Granted, this hospital is an OUTPATIENT orthopedic surgery only facility, no one would die if these surgeries were canceled until the weather improved. Their urgent care clinics were very low volume clinics as it is, it was highly doubtful that anyone would come to a minor urgent care while there was several feet of snow on the ground. Staff were told they should be prepared to sleep at hospital facilities for days on end regardless of their situation. (I doubt the one executive told his wife she would have to stay at the urgent care with no electricity or running water). This all occurred while management was able to work from home. (A lot of \"do as I say, not as I do\" attitude from management. Management did not seem like a team player. I personally raised a question to leadership who were RN's and said \"If it comes down to it, and we don't have the staff, you have RN after your name. Are you prepared to roll up your suit sleeves to help out the clinical staff?\" I never got an answer)\nWhen I first started in their inpatient unit as a PCT, the unit manager was great and supportive that I was a student. Then she left to go to NP school. The new nurse manager (Deanna Hamilton) came in and that's where things took a turn. I noticed more and more that the unit become more unhappy and at times toxic. Other employees were written up for trivial things. She was not very supportive of me being a student. While people were nice for the most part, I felt very unsupported at times. There would be times were I would ask for help or clarification on policies and the response I would get is \"Shouldn't you know that.....did you go to the meetings...\u2026\" and other snide comments."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "BEST PLACE TO WORK", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Director in Tyler, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great employees.
