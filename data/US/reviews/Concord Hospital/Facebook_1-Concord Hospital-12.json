We have each other\u2019s backs and I have always been proud of that. \u2022 Pay is pretty decent. Starting at $18.00 but most start at $20.00. Night Diff is $5.00 and 3-11 is $3.00. \u2022 Great Equipment is provided: New Tasers, Belts, Cuffs, a whole Security Operations Center, and a state of the art radio system. Brand New Security Vehicle. If we need something they do provide. \u2022 Training is alright. The new training manager does a solid job on making sure that people have the resources that they need. \u2022 Earned time is very good! 400 Hours a year and if you need a day off, management will approve! \u2022 Support staff are awesome. Amanda and Sue are the best and they are not nearly paid enough for what they have to do!", "cons": "\u2022 If you were former Law Enforcement/Corrections you are good until you mess up. If you ever carried a badge on the street the expectation is that you will come in and think like a cop. If you never did, the expectation is that you stay your course and do the grunt work. \u2022 Management is \u201cMicromanagement\u201d One Manager is good, the other manager is an equivalent to a dictator. If it\u2019s not in policy its wrong. Management does an amazing job at Monday morning quarterbacking and deciding how you should be doing things, just from reviewing camera footage. If they don\u2019t have a correct answer on something, then they tell you to do it a certain way, you do it that way and they say it was wrong. \u2022 Refuse to acknowledge the culture problem. The managers to the director refuse to acknowledge the massive culture problem in the department that has gotten worse. From hiring a Managers wife for dispatch, to ignoring Officer\u2019s and Lead Officer\u2019s concerns, to allowing Medical staff to make decisions on behalf of safety and security. The department as a whole in the last year has lost some great officer\u2019s and the leaders think it\u2019s because there are better opportunities out there not because the culture has gotten so bad! \u2022 The department is run like a small Police Department. The director is a Democratic former Police Chief, and all three managers are former Police Officers. For example, a crash on campus is investigated by Concord Police. They come and take a report, but then Security Officers write a report. EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED. EVERYTHING IS A REPORT. If you got out of Police Work to stop writing reports, this will not be the place for you! \u2022 You will get hurt! This is not a sit down, watch camera\u2019s type of job. You respond to all types of calls including running into dangerous situations with sometimes only 2-3 Officers. When you arrive you have to take direction from Medical Staff even if they don\u2019t know what to do, or if the situation has nothing to do with a medical issue. Many Officers are getting hurt, concussed, and banged up because they are running low on staff and patients are becoming more violent. \u2022 The Behavioral Health Department is a mess! There are two locations, Yellow and Blue Pod. Both are in the ED. Blue Pod is not locked but Yellow Pod is. A lot of the Yellow Pod Staff throw you under the bus or decide that they don\u2019t like you just because. As an Officer, you get ZERO training on handling Behavioral Health Patients and everything you say is wrong according to Staff. Lately they have been placing 3-4 juveniles into a locked unit with convicted sex offenders and management is OK with this because it opens up beds in the ED. \u2022 The Process improvement is punitive. The whole point of the I-Care reporting system is to help fix issues within the organization. The Security Department is the only department that seems to think they are above the process. After an I-Care is written (even minor ones) they pull you into the office, ask you about it, and then tell you that \u201cthis talk is not bad talk\u201d and they then proceed to tell you everything you did wrong without half the time taking into account your side. \u2022 They will throw you under the bus for the sake of the organization before they have your back. For a bunch of Former Police Officer they don\u2019t have your back. You are thrown to the wolves and Managers/Directors can never do wrong. \u2022 The Hospital as a whole has become a miserable place to work. All the resources have been diverted to Laconia and Franklin. The hospital is not cleaned, the patients are not receiving appropriate care and EVERY staff member, minus the boys/girls on the Third-Floor are suffering.
