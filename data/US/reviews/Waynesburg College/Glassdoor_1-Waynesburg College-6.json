They say they want terminal degrees then get rid of professors with them for no valid reason! If a student complains, the faculty is assumed wrong and called into the provost's office and confronted. They will post the current professor's position while they still work there and not even tell them they are going to let them go. The last Provost was so bad others refused to work with her and was forced to resign. The current provost is a lawyer and unprofessional! The administration is very political and certainly does not act in a Christian manner.  In 3 years, one department has got rid of all their good professors with doctorates. If you are crazy enough to work there, make them put you on a tenure track contract immediately. They like to put new employees on one-year contracts and pressure them. The administration has frozen the tiny 1% yearly pay raises, yet the President\u2019s and Provost are obscene compared to the size of the university. I highly recommend you find another college to work for. Don't think that things will go different for you."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Workstudy student-worker", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Mar 2013", "job_title": "Student Worker in Waynesburg, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people I worked with were wonderful, and they were accommodating to my school schedule and projects.
