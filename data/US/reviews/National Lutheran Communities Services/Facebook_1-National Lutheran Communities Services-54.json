Things feel a bit chaotic right now but I think that is what is happening everywhere. Definitely some favoritism happens at the leadership level.

I am especially looking forward to the DEI program becoming more expansive than it is right now, especially in regards to sexuality and gender identity.

I've never seen a company that struggles to retain their employees so poorly and it's not surprising to see the good employees leaving at such a rapid pace leaving inexperienced employees in their stead. I'm not quite sure what the numbers are, but I can't imagine the retention rate of employees being over 50%. The compensation is also atrocious. In 2 weeks of searching for another job, I was able to find another company that offered more than 30% increase of my salary. This seems to be a general theme I found when discussing with former colleagues who have also left. You will need a direct supervisor who can negotiate on your behalf to get an even small percentage of what your market value is. NLCS boasts their partnership with an outside company who helps to research what salaries their employees have but it's clearly not working as it seems like neither inflation nor job skills are taken into account for this \"raise.\""}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It's ok", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Nov 2022", "job_title": "IT Support Technician in Rockville, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent people, ok pay, good team.", "cons": "Head management changed and had to make cuts decided that IT was the place to start."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Used to be great, now ok, lots of room for improvement", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Manager in Rockville, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and amount of time off.
