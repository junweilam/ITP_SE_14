The whole experience quickly revealed the values and belief systems of the company.  Outwardly, they present much concern for the client.  Internally, our program was told, time and time again, to reschedule and cancel client's appointments to further the executive management's agenda.  Their agenda will override any and all client or employee's concerns.  This is important to know, not only from an employee perspective but also as a client.  Bottom line is:  the propaganda Rosecrance puts out about their values, etc. is NOT congruent with current employment relations and practices.

Disrespect and direct insults from management. Unit staff has no back up from management when it comes to patient behavioral issues, if the patient had insurance there will be NO repercussions no matter how well documented, unit staff has no authority to deal with inappropriate behaviors . Management/HR lies about raises (often promises 50 cent raise after 6 months and yearly.) Fact is at best you will only get a 33 cent raise yearly and thats if you are VERY well liked, most get much less. SOPs very much out of date. One was just \"updated\" this year saying that staff should wear gloves when changing diapers on the family unit, that unit has been gone for over 4 years. However management will be quick to ask you when you ask a question (that they usually don't know the answer to) \"What does the SOP say?\". The computer system is terrible and there is NO training on how to use it, it's all trial and error. Also the system goes down often with no other patient chart back ups for emergencies.
