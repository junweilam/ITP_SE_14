They began micromanaging and cut staff to the bare minimum. This resulted in our excellent manager leaving the company. The next manager was inexperienced though I believe she tried to manage the many new projects thrust upon her as best as she could. In 2014, Healtheast brought in managers that were incompetent, very authoritarian and disrespectful toward many nurses. Some nurses were immune. Management had their favorites and their scapegoats. Staffing was a complete mess. We were short almost every shift and little was done to remedy this. The manager refused to help with triage as past managers had done. Nurses were forced to work double shifts sometimes overnight (3-11pm then 11pm to 7am) due to sick calls that left us with no night RN. Management again refused to step up to the plate and take responsibility for the department and the staffing woes we had which were due to their incompetence. Then when patients were unhappy with wait times or if lower priority patients received less attention, our manager would reprimand us for it.  Though she refused to assist the nurses or to remedy the staffing shortage, our manager was quick to write nurses up for even trivial matters, anything that bothered her really, with no sense of equal treatment for all. One evening an RN was forced to work alone on the busiest night of the week. This was not due to sick calls but due to vacation time being granted to all the other nurses scheduled that night. One of these was a last minute vacation request that our manager approved knowing this would put only one RN working that shift. Normal scheduling for such a shift is 4 nurses and even then it is challenging. This nurse worked that shift alone and received no support or direction from management whatsoever. Phone calls and e-mails were unreturned. Several days later our manager went looking for problems and mistakes from that shift.
