Most classrooms do not have heat or air conditioning so it's sweaty in summer and freezing in winter.\nDid I mention that when I left the whole school was on probation and not expected to be open in 2 years because they give almost every student a scholarship so the salary I was offered before I left was barely 30K/year for 30 credits/year. The highest levels of admin have ZERO respect for faculty and I lost track how many times colleagues in my department were insulted with name calling and broken promises from so-called leaders.
