One person was always late, left for periods of up to 2 hours (serious), antagonized the clients, neglected basic documentation, and deflected blame onto others when criticized. I endured this person for 3 years, and despite management assuring me that they would handle my and many others' complaints, they acted identically. It was demoralizing to put in genuine effort and be reprimanded when someone who repeatedly shirked the rules was able to keep working. Shameful. Other, prior employees would neglect their duties and allow clients to live in squalor. Expect to work harder if you are a good employee, as coworkers have no accountability with no supervisor present in-house.\r\n\r\nCoworkers frequently told me about how management attempted to coerce them into putting in more hours. Nobody trusted that management would help when bad things happened. I often had to deal with unpredictable situations on my own.\r\n\r\nRarely did I feel like my workplace concerns were taken seriously. Various supervisors would say that they empathized and that things would change, but I never saw it. Scarcely did I feel good about going to work after a point. People always complained and they complained about the same few topics that never saw resolution. Everyone resented management and the bad actor at our house. I don't think anyone actually trusted one another. \r\n\r\nCommunication was pretty bad. I routinely found  out about new client information, appointments, dietary changes, schedule changes, and so on secondhand instead of from leadership. For a long time, I was one of the few at my station that regularly communicated house discrepancies. This only improved when new hires came onboard and helped pick up the slack.\r\n\r\nI learned over time to self-advocate, since communication was lacking, morale was always low, and people were not trustworthy. I could only depend on myself in the end, so I became good at micromamanagement.

Medication management is a huge part of the job, and I always felt super uncomfortable because I felt like a nurse should be monitoring medications. \n\nBy the way, THERE IS NO SUPERVISION. You are COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN. there is an on call supervisor that is supposed to be available by phone or text if needed, but there were quite a few instances where the supervisor would not answer the phone, so I had to make a decision on the fly, and if it turned out to be wrong, I would get blamed for it, when really the supervisor should've ANSWERED THE PHONE. \n\nI did not like being the only staff on site during my shift. There should be at least one other coworker, in case something goes terribly wrong. I also feel there should be trained security onsite, in case a client gets physically aggressive and possibly dangerous. The lives of the clients are completely in your hands, and that's a lot of pressure.\n\nI will admit that I made mistakes during my time at Mosaic, but the upper staff often expected me to know certain things that were not common knowledge, that should've been explained to me when I was hired or during training, and I would find myself in situations where I truly did not know what to do. And again, if a supervisor is not answering the phone, you're on your own. \n\nPaid Time Off: often, having this benefit was useless because the majority of the on call staff are either college students who have classes during your shift, or people with other full time jobs. You have to \"secure coverage\" before asking your supervisor for the time off. It was a hassle every time. So, work life balance was often nonexistent. Good luck planning vacations. \n\nNote: the job description on Mosaic's site is not telling the whole truth about what you're about to get yourself into. If you're interested in this position, and get asked to interview, make sure you ask them to explain to you in detail what you will be doing. I did not do this, because I thought I had a good grasp on what I would be doing, and I was horribly wrong.

They make the HR representative for benefits so hard to contact.", "cons": "Management is very unprofessional. Seeing the patients be in a \"crisis\" and not get the therapeutic help they needed was very upsetting. This hospital lets people who are NOT trained to run groups are responsible for helping patients. While some people had their bachelors degrees, a lot of the time the bachelor degree was in a completely unrelated field. I just do not understand how they can let people with only a high school diploma run \"therapeutic\" groups when they have not properly been trained.\r\n\r\nThere is no help when it comes to people who even want to properly run groups. The way that staff talks to patients is beyond disrespectful. \r\n\r\nSheppard Pratt has a way of making it seem like this incredible place to work for, when in reality you are put in danger for horrible pay.  Males on the line made significantly more than females. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"annual raise\" of 2% was mere cents for what Mental Health Workers make and never made a difference really in your paycheck.\r\n\r\nMandations were awful but not the worst part of the job. \r\n\r\nTurnover rate is so high, they even had a survey about why people were leaving, but nothing was done. Everyone was scared that names were attached to the survey because they had you enter in your email so you could win a \"raffle\". \r\n\r\nIt's a shame that I once took pride in the fact that I worked at one of \"the best psychiatric hospitals\" but I now see that it was the \"best\" because of how much stuff they cover up, not only on the units but upper management. \r\n\r\nSome staff brag about how they \"took down\" patients with force because they were acting out too much. \r\n\r\nThey do not work with school schedules but they promise you in the beginning that they do. \r\n\r\nHonestly just the treatment of the patients overall is sad. People come to this hospital for help. I do not believe that they truly get the help they need, even if it is short term care. I would never ever let my child or anyone I know willingly go to this hospital. \r\n\r\nParents would ask to switch doctors for their child and would not be allowed to. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity for growth but always tell you that they are \"looking into a program that would have advancement opportunities\".\r\n\r\nHonestly people spend more time covering up mistakes and lying about what Sheppard Pratt is as opposed to making it a better place. \r\n\r\nThe entire hospital is just corrupt.
