There were horror stories about some of the doctors working there being very controlling of how things were done and by the time I left, I had horror stories of my own. Many areas lacked appropriate supplies. Rolling walkers for pt's to use could not be found except for the one's carried by rehab. dept. staff. Also hoyer lifts or gerichairs could not be found on nursing units to use with heavy dependent transfer patients and nurses would not move these pt's at all since only Rehab staff were \"qualified\" to manage their mobility and nurses did not have the equipment to do it anyway. Wheelchairs in the hospital had their removable leg rests permanently welded on which can make transfers very dangerous in many situations. When I worked at Jackson, Rehab staff were asked to bill for 90% of their time (which is impossible to do even if you could document all of your caseload in the remaining 10% of your time). Case Management and MD's frequently would make discharge decisions and tell pt's where they were going to go and then afterwards consult PT/OT staff to see the pt and expect therapy staff to support those decisions even when pt functional ability did not support those decisions. This was especially prominent on the orthopedics floor where many pt's (esp. total joint replacement pt's) who were able to mobilize independently were still encouraged to go to Rehab by the case manager and doctor."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Working at Jackson Hospital", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2012", "job_title": "Systems Engineer in Montgomery, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My position at Jackson is challenging and rewarding.
