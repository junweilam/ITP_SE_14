Ultimately made the decision to leave when I realized it would be impossible for me to have friends outside of EC, have a family, and be apart of a \"growing church\".  The emphasis was always on growth and numbers -which I respected because it kept us accountable.  However, there was no work life integration.  \r\n\r\nIf you had any interests outside of what the church was doing - it was wrong and you were asked to not do it and judged for having \"conflicting priorities\".   You cannot work at Elevation Church and have healthy boundaries with anything outside of the church - UNLESS - other staff are doing too.  Like having a volleyball team or signing your kids up in dance.  If its not just you - its appropriate.  \r\n\r\nOn a campus level - I only had one day off a week and sometimes not even that.  You could say no, but it came with consequences.  To be completely practical - I had to cancel my gym membership because every time I tried to go - it was closed.  I lost friends because they did not go to my campus or to the church at all and I did not have time to see them.  When I did see them I was so distracted - I would not have been my friend either!  I was told that I might not be able to go to my only brother's wedding because of what the church had on the calendar."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "What an amazing place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Matthews, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In my opinion, I couldn't imagine working anywhere else! \r\nWe are family.\r\nI've never worked somewhere like this where I enjoy all the people I get to work with!
