I understood this was a startup company, but they have been opened for over a year and they STILL have the same issues. \r\n\r\nFor instance, SAFETY. They understaff so badly that people have gotten hurt and they don\u2019t care. They follow a \u201cgrid\u201d and that \u201cgrid\u201d is terribly dangerous to you the worker and the other patients. There were times when MHTs would be by themselves with a violent patient and got hit and since it was in an area where there happened to be no cameras the patient was always correct and the staff would be told to \u201cget a lawyer\u201d... Seriously! Its terrible. \r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT: You NEVER saw them on the floor and if you did they would either be yelling at you or going against policy and letting the patients do whatever. It was terrible, no one is on the same page there.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATION: TERRBILE! There isn\u2019t one!!! They say they care in orentation but I was there for a couple of months and it was the same issues, and they would focus on the tinyest things instead of the bigger issues.\r\n\r\nSTAFFING: So many people call out ALL THE TIME! Leaving you with NO STAFF! So now its severely understaffed and dangerous! WHen you needed a manager NO ONE WOULD COME! They used supervisors BUT sometimes even they weren\u2019t there! \r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE: There wasnt any. On the weekends it was a free for all for the patients. No therapists, doctors, social workers come in on weekends so nurses and MHT\u2019s were left to do groups and the rest of the day free. It was terrible, then since they were ALWAYS short staffed patients couldn\u2019t go down to the gym or whatnot because it wasn\u2019t safe! \r\n\r\nSECURITY: There is NO security durning the day. Only 3-11 & 11-7a. BUT, they make them as MHT\u2019s and sit on 1:1 so if something is happening they cant do anything. So unsafe! They figure durning the day they have enough \u201cupper managerment\u201d who are USELESS and just STARE and watch! None of them would restrain a patient in high heels and suits!\r\n\r\nBUILDING: Its falling apart! Housekeeping is a joke! There only there during the week, 7-3 and its 1 or 2 people! The place is gross and filthy! They hardly clean the adolescent unit because there so scared to be over there and when asked they say there too busy because they have the whole place to clean. So what does that come down to MONEY!\r\n\r\nMONEY: This place is ALL ABOUT MAKING MONEY! They do NOT care about the patients. These patients are so acute and you need proper staff to help them and its not far for 1 person to set the whole milieu off because you cant have any \u201cextra\u201d person to help de-escalate. \r\n\r\nCODES: Tons of restraint codes. Espically on Adolescent Unit. They understaff this unit a lot, so you can\u2019t properly keep them entertained. That\u2019s also where structure comes in, not enough structure to keep them busy.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT: HOSTILE! As soon as I stepped onto the floor, nurses, MHT\u2019s, therapists, were so upset and angry! Angry because of all these issues that have been brought to management and done nothing about it. I have seen MHT\u2019s and nurses walk out because they are in fear or their license and TRUST ME this place could careless about your license or safety! \r\n\r\nPAY: Yes they do pay good BUT is it really worth all the hassle, unsafe practices, and losing your licenses for a company would could care less about you and the patients in the end. People call out ALL the time and now your stuck doing checks all night even though you shouldn\u2019t be but what are they going to do?!\r\n\r\nINTAKE: They DO NOT screen patients! Meaning that these can be ex felons, sex offenders, rap sheets a mile long and the staff is not properly trained to handle that nor the staffing ratio is so bad it\u2019s very unsafe.\r\n\r\nOverall: people are tired there, the staff that are good and come in are overworked and tired and end up leaving because of the practices. There is a HIGH turnover rate. You will find very few nurses and MHT\u2019s that were there when the place opened after that the place is running on new people. They are hiring and doing orentation every 2 weeks and some people leave right away because they see and hear what is going on. Its sad. The idea of helping patients is there BUT it all boils down to TERRIBLE management and making money! \r\n\r\nMy advice, dont waste your time."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Awesome staff, terrible management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Mental Health Technician in Westborough, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The MHTs, RNs, clinicians, and medical staff are all amazing and hardworking.

They are understaffed yet send people home to fit an arbitrary grid system that leaves MHTs alone on units at times dealing with 12+ patients. I have been scared for my life and the lives of patients and my coworkers too many times to count due to management\u2019s inability to schedule and staff units. All they care about is opening new units to fill beds and make more money, even though they don\u2019t have enough staff to function with the already present units. Employee turnover is as high as I\u2019ve ever seen it at a company due to these issues. About half of the orientation groups quit their first day on the units, and the ones who stay quit one or two weeks later.
