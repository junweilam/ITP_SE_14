If you're a student looking for a job on-campus, there are few cons to tutoring, but I have heard on the grapevine that dining hall workers, especially non-student workers, are not respected and that injuries have occurred due to understaffing leading to dangerous conditions.\r\n\r\nOne con of tutoring is that I was only paid for up to 15 minutes a week of preparation time (ie, a quarter of my hourly salary). This is ridiculous because a good tutoring session will require at least a half hour of preparation. If you team up with other tutors to prepare material, it's more reasonable, but if you are the only tutor for the class and you genuinely care about your students' success, you will probably end up doing unpaid labor in order to prepare for your sessions (making sample questions, etc)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Promotions non-existant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "5 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful city, supportive coworkers, Excellent benefits.", "cons": "Staff have no room for upward mobility, near impossible to get re-classified even if they add extra job duties, every boss I had there told me the only way to \"be promoted\" was to look for a new position which is never what I wanted to do.

Which is good in it own way.  But actual action would be ever so much better.  I have known more than one person who has been discriminated against and it has been shrugged shoulders from administration and a trip to the counselor who says file a complaint.\r\n\r\nA PI should be granted a good deal of freedom to run their lab as they see fit.  But that said, grad students without a home in a lab because of a cantankerous PI shouldn't be sidelined.  The departments I have seen treat the students that don't find a good match instantly with a PI as extraneous flotsam that should just float away.\r\n\r\nI have also noted serous academic miss deeds by some faculty.  The research data gets fudged a bit, a data point dropped here or a control run slightly off there.  Students should also be holding their PI's to the mark.  But when the PI's hold all the cards and management doesn't act like the students have any value...  No one is going to come forward.  The trouble is it isn't egregious it just teaches people that cutting corners is ok.\r\n\r\nThis is a big one!  The cost of living is absolutely sky high in this area.  You are going to rent a one room studio for over half your monthly salary.  Because of the poor road layout you spend 20-40 min just getting off campus to get home, that is if you drive.  Parking is absolutely outrageously expensive too.  OK, so you take the bus, it is free after all.  But NO!  You can't.  You absolutely can not take the bus.  Why?  Because they are full and full for hours.  Wait at the bus stop at 8pm when you have been in lab since 9 am good luck.  You are going to stand there till 11 pm on some nights.  So you get home at 11 pm you don't have time to cook!  So you ether go out to eat or starve.  There is one other option.  Live on campus in family student housing...  Which is ok.  But not an option everyone likes as there are kids.  Yes they do scream at 7 am in the morning...  Which is ok if you don't mind a neighbor could be doing the same thing off campus.  Long story short the housing there is HORIBLE!  Far to expensive, and getting to it is way WAY to much work.  If you go to grad school you expect to spend 60-70 hours working.  When you spend 20 hours a week commuting when you live locally!  You are not going to be able to pull it off and come out achieving the work you want.  I would rather work 90 hours and not have to commute as much."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Working with Drupal for Fun and Profit", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Aug 2013", "job_title": "Web Developer Assistant in Santa Cruz, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, not much challenge to the job, very little oversight,  lots of experimenting and learning Drupal even though I had pretty much no coding experience.", "cons": "Working in a cubicle in the basement with only 3 people in a huge room is a pretty depressing work environment, made worse so than the two days a week where you work completely alone.

It is very \"hands off\" so they won't help you if it's your first year (won't tell you which textbooks the department uses, or what is actually supposed to be taught/covered in the course). They tell you to \"teach whatever you want\", try to get the lecturers to take the responsibility when there's a strike or some kind of discord with students, instead of issuing a department-wide policy (such as students asking for no-harm final during protests). A big issue was giving false reasons that are against union contact for why they are paying a lower salary than they originally quoted (mislead about it; when the union rep looked at the communications, the rep said he was \"floored\" by it). The big one was they said they didn't want me to make more money than a particular person based on their personal preference (not university or department rules) even though I had the mandated qualifications and the very good teaching reviews. There is little to no room for promotion because a part-time lecturer is an Adjunct (although they don't use that term, it's effectively what it is). You are not guaranteed full-time courses or even any courses from term to term, and could be given courses at the very last minute. I believe you can get a small raise eery 4-6 years, but was told that unless it's stated in your employment offer they can try to take away the 4-year raise. You do not get certain union rights until you teach 18 terms which is about 6 years.
