When it all boils down, being an admissions counselor is a sales job so you have all of the travel, goals and pressure with none of the pay. I heard more than once from the President that admissions counters are a dime a dozen so they aren't worth a decent wage. When I was there, we had to work our standard 8 hours in the office then make calls to prospective students at night. In addition there were many of weekends for visit days and such. All for a barely livable wage.\n\nThe admissions leadership is in desperate needs of a house cleaning. They insist on doing things the way it has always been done and refuse to adapt to the millennial generation. They need to bring in all new leadership or accept that the counselors will never meet their goals. \n\nIf you are a student just out of college, it can be fun to get to travel and be on the road with other admissions counselors but it gets old quick. There is no way you can do with job with a significant other, let alone kids since so much time is demanded of you. Simpson needs to learn about flex hours and how to properly treat admissions counselors or they will continue to have to constantly hire because of turnover."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Simpson College", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Security Officer in Indianola, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Feels close knit, easy to form connections, benefits", "cons": "Not immune to drama, poor pay and very limited ways to increase pay"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "The students are awesome, the pay is not.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "2 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Admissions Counselor in Indianola, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I loved getting to work with students on a daily basis.
