This assistant CNO had security tow my car on a Friday at 2 in the afternoon. The tow place closed at 4 and if a tech hadn't offered to drive me to the tow place, I would have had to wait until Monday to get my car and pay $300 because it is $100 a night to have my car there and they are closed on the weekend. A security guard even said that they had never seen someones car get towed before and he has been working there for over 20 years. I just wanted to do my job and be happy. Apparently having experience and a good education means nothing when you park in the wrong parking spots.
