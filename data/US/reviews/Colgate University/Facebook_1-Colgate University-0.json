If, like me, you've had your fill of loud, crowded cities, it's a really wonderful, beautiful location.  There's also a really great community of junior faculty as well as young people in the area (many of whom went to Colgate, then continued to hang out).  Colgate is also very good for families.", "cons": "Colgate is at the leading edge of every bad trend in higher education, and brainless trend-following is at the top of the list!  The curriculum is being dumbed-down and grade-inflation (and work-deflation) is rampant because the target student for admittance is wealthy, whiny, and helicopter-parented.  Colgate builds its brand as being a sports & party-school conduit to high paying jobs you'll get through connections, not because of anything you learn in the classroom, and resource allocations reflect this, and the management desires only the double-down on these aspects, hastening the school's descent in the rankings (even while it tries to \"game the system\" of rankings with absurdities such as enforcing enrollment caps only the semester when US New & World Report is \"counting\").\r\n\r\nAnother con is for people who come to Colgate without families, ironically.  The structure of health insurance, as well as the child-tuition benefit, and even a mortgage assistance program all provide big bonuses to people with lots of kids and who are ready and financially able to buy a house in short order (before tenure review).  Even the structuring of campus activities and focus on the family in terms of child-care and fringe benefits makes clear that the university's preferred employees are those with a stay-at-home spouse and big families.  There are lots of reasons why this is in the university's interests, of course, but it sends a clear message about which employees are valued and which are expendable.\r\n\r\nA related difficulty is that depending on what your partner's work and training is, it can be nearly impossible for the local economy to provide meaningful employment to a \"trailing spouse\".  This is particularly true if that partner has anything to do with academia, either in a teaching or any other capacity.  While the school pays lip-service to the idea that it wants to \"help\" new faculty's partners find meaningful employment, this is a huge hypocrisy which clothes a \"willingness\" to exploit highly-trained and -effective people far below their value, along with the implied affront that such partners should be grateful to have any position at Colgate it all, since the institution is practically God's gift.\r\n\r\nIn fact, lip-service and hypocrisy suffuses every part of this institution, which is increasingly run according to externally imposed \"best-practices\" with little attention to the views of the faculty."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent work place environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Visiting Instructor/Assistant Professor in Hamilton, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent work environment plus the opportunities to work closely with smart and engaged students.

Working for such a small institution requires that individual employees have large amounts of responsibilities in very specific areas. As such, there is little catalyst for mid-level management to provide opportunities for your growth in new areas because there are not enough people to delegate responsibilities to. In order for you to learn/grow, you have to do it on your own, private time. This time is not compensated.\r\n\r\nA culture of doing more than double the work that you are compensated for has become the norm. In order to receive a significant raise, promotion, or title change, you have to do the work of others for over a year before being recognized. Sometimes, you are not recognized for this work at all. Many mid-level employees have double and triple job titles as the only way they can hope to advance is to take on more and more work. Colgate benefits from this culture financially as instead of hiring three directors for very different roles, they can hire one over-worked, under-paid director instead.\r\n\r\nBy \"significant raise\" I mean 2%. Incredibly slow growth makes it difficult for the institution to maintain a work force for entry level positions. Young people are taken advantage of regularly by a system that is operating at a cut-throat level of business usually reserved for Wall Street financiers.
