If you have any other choices I\u2019d recommend you take them over NCH.  Until management makes some changes this is not a good place to work.  Three of the biggest issues I have are:\r\n\r\n1. Management overworks everyone.  Most doctors, nurses, and staff at NCH are pretty unhappy.  Since I started at NCH about 5 years ago the workload has steadily increased.  The amount of time you have to see each patent has been reduced.  The number of clinics you have to do has increased.  The number of publications you need to have to get promoted has increased.\r\n\r\n2. NCH has a very restrictive non-compete clause.  The non-compete clause is non-negotiable and extends for 100 miles.  This prevents you from being able to work anywhere in Columbus or in nearby cities such as Dayton and Cincinnati.  NCH added the non-compete clause because too many doctors were leaving to go to work in Cincinnati or Dayton.  Instead of trying to make the work environment better they just decided to add a non-compete clause to prevent anyone from leaving.  Before working at NCH you need to ask yourself why they need a non-compete clause that extends for 100 miles.  They have very few patients from Cincinnati so a doctor working there wouldn\u2019t be in competition with NCH.\r\n\r\n3. Too much focus on the bottom line and profits instead of patient care.  NCH is bad about replacing people who leave.  To save money they try not to hire new staff and instead just force everyone else to do more.

They push you to contact people's emergency contact numbers just to get patients to enroll in the program. You are also expected to contact non-enrolled members' providers and ask for patient phone numbers to call which leads to other providers to feel uncomfortable and angry because typically this information is not shared. While this is legal, I did not find it ethical. Again, no information regarding these calls were disclosed during interviews.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, they have overhired causing a majority of  new employees to have empty caseloads and new employees are expected to make these \"enrollement calls\" until they have something to do.
