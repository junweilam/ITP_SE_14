The HR Department has not had a Director for more than 6 months in the last 2 years. \r\n\r\nNo long term vision for the company / department: They just buy clinic after clinic while cutting open FTEs, forcing ever increasing workloads of anyone that departs onto their peers. \r\n\r\nYou honestly won't know what work you'll be doing in 3 months because they don't know themselves.\r\n\r\nThe way both the Administration treats, and allows Physicians to treat, the general staff is horrifying. I've heard recorded phone calls of Surgeons threatening to get Help Desk staff fired for just asking troubleshooting questions. I've had Nurses tell me stories of Physicians threatening to kill them. That's not hyperbolic, they really threatened them and when they brought it up to HR, they were moved into a different department; No corrective action for the Doctor who threatened them."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Meh", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Surgical Aide in Cape Girardeau, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits\r\nNice environment\r\nFun job\r\n\r\nNothing else", "cons": "Poor management and pay\r\nConstantly changing\r\nNot enough support"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Required review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cape Girardeau, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and friendly colleagues", "cons": "Large work load and short staff"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Nice Working Environment", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Lab Assistant in Cape Girardeau, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good flexibility with scheduling, Decent Pay", "cons": "High benefit plans, Poor management"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "What", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Patient Care Attendant in Saint Francis, SD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great job.
