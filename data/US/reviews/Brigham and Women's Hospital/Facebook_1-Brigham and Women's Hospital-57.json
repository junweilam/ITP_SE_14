Therefore, you only have 29 \"days off\" per year, however you choose to use them.  If you subtract the 9 federal holidays, you're at 20 total days off per year.

Often times, these are the CCRNs who are a part of every committee representing Care Coordination, which is an embarrassment.

Additionally, as most hospitals are, many of the admins perform low-quality work and repeatedly make the same mistakes, that we are then forced to pick up the slack for. There were never any consequences to anyone in administrative roles, and they are impossible to fire, which leads to a glut of unqualified and poor workers, which then hinder every other aspect of hospital operations. My team was micro-managed, and yet when we did have problems, such as direct conflict between what two different doctors wanted (ex, both wanted access to the ultrasound at the same time) we were told to \"figure it out\". The idea that the lowest people on the totem pole (MAs) would \"tell doctors what to do\" is ridiculous and insulting. Also, the hospital was greedy. It seems silly, but for all the time we worked there, we never even got so much as a t-shirt. We were expected to PAY for merchandise with the hospital's logo on it. They told us \"we should be grateful\" when we were given a half-eaten platter of cold sandwiches after we were forced to work through lunch due to short staffing. Additionally, management bullied us, making comments on our appearances/weight, literally workplace harassment. When one of us left the company, even if we gave 6+ weeks notice, they never started looking for a replacement until after the employee had left, leaving us all short-staffed, unable to use vacation time for months at a time. When a new employee was not capable of performing the work, even after months of training, we expressed that to management. We were yelled at and told \"it's your fault he's not getting it, you're not training him properly!!\" even though every other employee my team had trained has understood and subsequently been able to perform their job. The patients were rude, and instead of the doctors having an ounce of backbone and telling them \"no, we can't see you when you show up two hours late and yell at the receptionists\" they let them in, where we are then expected to accommodate their poor behavior. All in all, I was miserable from start to finish during my time at BWH, and I'm so relieved to have left. I will never go back there, not even for my own care.
