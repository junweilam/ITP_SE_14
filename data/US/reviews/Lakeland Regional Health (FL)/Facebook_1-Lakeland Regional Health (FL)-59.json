Please don\u2019t be deterred by the 1 Star on HealthGrades, this is a wonderful place and the managers truly care about the staff. I primarily work in the SICU, but we can also pick up in other ICU units (Neuro ICU / MICU / TICU). It is a wonderful place to work. The staff is helpful, the managers have your back, and the doctors are team players. There is no Doctor vs. Nurse or Dayshift vs. Nightshift. Everyone is part of a team, and it makes for a great place to work. Here is the skinny\u2026. WORK DAYS\u2026.We work 3/12s, and there is always the opportunity to pick up more shifts. Currently, you have the option to work your 3 shifts on weekdays only, weekends with 1 weekday, or weekdays with rotating weekends, however I have heard they are only doing rotating weekends in the future (every other weekend). PATIENTS - The patients are very respectful and pleasant, which is amazing! Obviously, not everyone is going to be nice, but it\u2019s so much better than others places I\u2019ve worked where the patients are rude, hateful, and try to push your buttons in the hopes you will overstep so they can sue you. FLOAT DAYS - Every 4th shift, we do have the potential to float to a floor, and when we do, everyone is so appreciative. BENEFITS - Aetna for medical and MetLife for Dental. The price you pay depends on your family size. There is also a good 403b, Roth IRA, life insurance, and short / long term disability. If you have to do light duty, they will allow you to work in the Tele room. EARNED TIME OFF (ETO) - I believe they start you with 2 weeks of EARNED time, meaning you have to accrue it\u2026.you don\u2019t immediately have 2 weeks on January 1, but you can usually find someone to cover your shift.", "cons": "Just minor things really\u2026 - Not a Magnet hospital, but working on it. - In my opinion, the nursing pay could be better. - Intermittent staffing shortages, but that is everywhere. - The day shift employees (at least in the ICUs) have to park across the street, which can be inconvenient during bad weather. - We just started our ECMO program and are still working out the kinks, but overall, it\u2019s going great! - The cafeteria is expensive, they charge an arm and a leg for salad bc they charge by weight. - There are quite a few morbidly obese patients, so please be kind to your back when turning.
