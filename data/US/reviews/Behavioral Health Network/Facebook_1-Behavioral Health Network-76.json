At Boundless, I see all of those values in action every single day. Benefits are good, especially PTO. When you need time off, you are allowed to take time off, whether you're sick or you're going on vacation or even if you just need a day off. I have even been encouraged to use more of my PTO just to promote my own well-being.

The leadership most of the time take zero accountability for any issues that arise and if they do it's because, they messed up so bad that they couldn't hide from the fact. If there is a way to blame their hourly staff they will take the opportunity to do so, many staff are fired/suspended or have some type negative review of their actions if at all possible.\r\n\r\nOh, as for reviews and evaluations, they are only done when it benefits the coordinators or the Program Directors to minimize their work load. So if you want a bonus or high marks for the year end review good luck because, it won't happen. Their training sessions are a joke, all of the policies and procedures are constantly bent to the convenience of the management or flat out ignored because, again there are accountability issues all over their admin offices.

At the end of the day an organization lives and dies by it's leadership and there is none here to be seen, you'll have better luck finding it in a kindergarten class. For the record I left the company on good terms and was able to find a place that cares about it's employees and doesn't find any way possible to fire them for the most petty things.
