The facility here in Estherville are in such an utter disarray, no real leadership at all. Scheduling and staffing are not done by one department. Administrative jobs are so spread out, there is no streamlining of functions going on. They need real leadership here.\r\nI saw no long-term goals while I was there. There is very little planning or directions going on, workers barely knowing what\u2019s going to happen the next day, except the Upper Management\u2019s favorites, they know what in the plans for the week. To be fair, there are a couple of good workers in there, but they are doing their best with what little tools they are given. They need more good workers and get rid of the bad ones. \r\nThe Administrative Support Staff workers are poorly trained. They have favorites workers too, so the enforcement of rules is not consistent, they will not write them up but will write others up for the same offenses. They are not very honest, they do not keep their promises, they\u2019re cut hours of some workers and giving them to others. They are selective in accommodating a worker with disabilities and not others. They are not recruiting, and screening, interviewing applicants properly. \r\nConfidentiality is a nil there, paperwork lays around for others to see and read. For example: a coworker filled some paperwork out for time off for medical reasons. Someone read it and tell someone else. Another example: when a co-worker had an urgent private matter that needed to be attend to. She had only told the Upper Management in confidence and requested time off. Well, the Upper Management talked about the private matter and the co-worker came back and was dismayed to find her private matter made the gossip mill among the staff and residences. When she complained, she was taken aside and scolded by another Upper Management staff, so she quit. Also, the security cameras? Anyone could view the videos then gossiped about what they viewed. Yes, it had happened many times while I was there. Only the Upper Management should be allowed to see the videos. No confidentiality at all, there.\r\nA new person gets little training. Many of the workers who been there for years are behaving like a pack and gang-up on a new person. It is hostile environment, and it is growing worse at time goes by.  Some new staff and residents are being mistreated. Good workers come then quickly leaves when they realize how bad it is there. I had complained about a volatile action that was taken against me from a co-worker. I could have been injured.  She was spoke to about it. Since she was one of their favorites, so she was still there, and I moved to another department.\r\nThere are far too many young adults, no mature person on the evening shifts. They want to finish their work quickly and as result incomplete with the residents, they rush through their duties, just so they could sit down, and talk. They don\u2019t handle the expensive equipment correctly, and they slammed furniture around. The good nurses had tried telling them to do better work, but they don\u2019t listen to them and the Upper Management don\u2019t back them up. If they write them up, the Upper Management will give the name of who wrote up and the nurses suffer retaliations from the worker and their friends.  Good workers who stays, they moved to other shifts to get away from them. The residents suffer for it. The numbers of skin tears, infections, and depressions are growing. When they are put to bed at 7:30pm and they are wide awake at 2am. When there is one CNA on staff for 30 some residents at night and it is overwhelming to care for them when they want one on one attention. \r\nThey\u2019re had been short of staff on nights and they are overwork since January 2018 and the few staff left are pushed to give adequate cares the residents required. They call you day and night to work. Many concerns are voiced but are not addressed, except the major ones, that would get state attention are quickly handled. \r\nThere is an imbalance of support between shifts. One is invisible, least of thought of, while the other is first thought of when there extra money in the budget."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "a wonderful place to be employed :)", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Feb 2011", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant in Algona, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a wonderful feeling knowing you can help someone with the things they can no longer do themselves.

I just learned that even though they do pay holiday pay when you work one, they average it out to only pay you 5 out of 7 hour shift so that you still make the same amount of money you would on a normal day. Constantly overworked. My knees are going bad after 1 year of working here. Disrespect from nurses and aides, and impossible deadlines for apartment turnovers from upper management. You are expected to clean the apartment cielings, walls, floors, counters, toilet, sinks, shower, light sqotches, oven, fridge, outlets, baseboards, doors, door frames, under stove and fridge, closets and cupboards including all shelves and inside and out, you must climb the counters to clean the tops of cupboards. And all this is expected to be done in less than 6 hours and at your normal pay rate. They hide behind being \"non profit\" as to why they can't pay more or improve working conditions. On a normal day I clean 12 apartments in 7 hours with 2 15 min breaks and no 1/2hr lunch. After the apartments are done in which you can spend no more than 35 mins per apartment, you must vacuum the hallway, dust all light foxtures, disinfect handrails, and wash the walls. It is too.much for one person And we are constantly understaffed. Because no one wants to do hard physical labor for $11 an hour while enduring disrespect from all sides. And my job is easy compared to the care center housekeepers. They must clean up to 40 rooms per day in the same 7 hour shift. They are smaller and 2 rooms share a bathroom but it is obvious why they can't get anyone new to work there. I will be looking for new employment very soon because i am absolutely disgusted by their treatment of most of their staff. They pay lip service about how were all needed but it's all fake.
