Both of these individuals do not want to hear your opinion or respect it.  They've created a culture where you cannot say a word without getting your hand slapped or taken to the principles office.  Over the past 3 months, over 45% of the Admissions Staff has been given a verbal warning or written up for no valid reason.  The new management is simply trying to show their power of authority by writing people up.  Another con is the nights and weekends.  They expect you to be in the high schools during the day and with families in their home on nights and weekends.  There is literally no work to home life balance, which can cause strife in your own personal families.  Another con is that they have been on a pay freeze and hiring freeze for years. When jobs are posted, it is simply because the person employed quit or was let go, not because they are growing and have jobs that need filled.  I have never found a company with a culture like this, it's absolutely sickening that HR has let this go on for so long.  Take my advice and please do not even consider taking a job with this company because you will regret it.  There is not one person in Admissions that wants to work there, they are simply waiting it out to see if Management changes over the next year.  Management is also very condescending when they speak with you and treat you as if you are incompetent, when in all actuality you are more competent than they are.
