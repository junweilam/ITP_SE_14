Again, we are a hospital, how can we not give staff STD?! There have been improvements: for a year or more overtime pay for the nursing staff was taken away and nurses were regularly being mandated to work double shifts. That has ended. But mgmt doesn't understand why there are still bad feelings from the staff. Also, our cleaning staff hire in wage was cut to minimum wage. Again, mgmt doesn't understand why turnover has increased greatly and the regular staff is being over worked to compensate for not having a big enough cleaning crew.
