There is tasty and moderately inexpensive dining on campus (available during the fall and winter semesters), and an abundance of water fountains and bathrooms available.  Many of the people who work for the organization are pleasant, and taking time off isn't often a problem (this may depend on the particular area of coverage).  The colleges are also in close proximity of several fast-food options for lunch, and for a lot of people it's convenient to take classes (extremely affordable classes) at night after working during the day.", "cons": "To put it lightly, part-time employee compensation is insulting.  There are several different \"levels\" of wage for part time employees, which correspond to the job role.  For example, a computer technician may be a level three, while a library clerk may be a level two.  This is mandated by the union that is in place, which despite claims about protecting employees and offering great benefit, have wages for a level three (the top \"normal\" tier of worker) starting around $10/hr after 90 days, capping out at ~$14 after eight years of service (not including the 2.5% annual increase per pay grade).  This can be contrasted with a level one worker earning a paltry ~$7.75 after their 90 days.  Additionally, the annual raises begin on July 1st, and if you haven't reached your one-year at that date, you'll have to wait until the NEXT July 1st to begin receiving your annual raise.  So, for example, if you were hired in August you won't receive your \"annual\" raise until you've worked for 23 months.\r\n\r\nBenefits are essentially non-existent.  On July 1st of the year if you've come to a full year of service you will begin to accrue time off at 1% of what you work, which given a 30 hour a week maximum, you'll have a little more than two days off.  Of course, just like the pay raises, if your start date was after July 1st, you'll need to wait another year to begin accruing time off.  Over time, this grows to 1.5% for years 3-6 and 2% for 6+.  The only insurance option to buy in to is an offer for 1% off of Metlife.  There are a few discount offers through the union, the best of which is a 15% AT&T contract discount.  There are a multitude of holidays and days off, but for part time workers this isn't a vacation day as much as it's a \"don't bother coming in because we're not paying you\" day; part time workers do not get any kind of vacation pay for holidays, regardless of whether it's a day like Memorial day, or Christmas.\r\n\r\nManagement in my department doesn't manage much at all.  There is little, if any leadership, and the opportunity to move up to a full time position is wholly dependent on either someone quitting or dieing, provided that a position isn't eliminated to save on payroll.  Please bear in mind that this may be different based on your department.  The full time positions pay very well (too well, in my opinion) and offer good benefits as far as I can tell, but with financial hardships for the college and a lack of government funding (and an increase in attendance) there is a constant need to save money and eliminate positions.  Additionally, there is a move to make more positions part time, thus saving the college money.  In fact, in a recent \"state of the college\" address, the president proudly displayed on his Powerpoint presentation that less than ONE THIRD of the employees at the college are full time.  This is ironic, given the fact that many managers and administrators are more than happy to request expensive equipment and room changes, such as unnecessary computer hardware and printers, expensive software, and electrical/network installations."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good place to earn entry level tutoring experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Sept 2012", "job_title": "Foreign Language Tutor in Warren, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Give you a chance to get tutoring jobs with no previous experience provided that you know the material very well and can provide a letter of recommendation.
