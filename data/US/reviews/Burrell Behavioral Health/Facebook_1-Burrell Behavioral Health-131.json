As an African American woman, I feel that the smaller clinics need training regarding the language they use. Although it does not seem like the staff in clinic mean to be provocative or racist, they have implicit biases that say otherwise. I worked for Burrell for six months and my experiences with the clients were great. It was so great working with the clients that I ignored the unprofessionalism of staff at the Sedalia clinic. \r\nThere have been racial undertones in their conversations and right out divisive talk. This has made me very uncomfortable working for Burrell. Since I am not from Missouri, I am not accustomed to many of the states values. One thing that is universal is professionalism and I have not gotten that from my short time here. \r\nAlthough I had a great experience working with the clients and gaining knowledge to further my career, I did not feel welcomed when I first started my career with Burrell. There was isolation. \r\nThere is a lack of diversity and inclusiveness in the Sedalia Clinic. I believe all clinics should have sensitivity and cultural training so that staff are well equipped to handle racism and crude comments. Language is big part of what we  Community Support Specialist do. \r\nI appreciate your time and thank you for reading my concerns.

We have paid holiday time, and accrue vacation and sick leave at a competitive rate.\r\n\r\nCo-workers - This is probably the best part of my job.  I work at Gardine, where there are only a small handful of employees, so having a crew that works well together is imperative!  But even though our house crew is small, the company has a much larger crew, so whenever I've needed time off for vacation, or even the one time I had to call off for an emergency, someone has always been willing to help out with covering hours.  I have not worked here for very long, but there have already been at least three occasions I can think of where someone has gotten sick or hurt, and I've watched the team pull together to help take care of things till that employee was able to come back to work.  It's really great to have a reliable team where we have each other's backs.\r\n\r\nCommunication - We have weekly staff meetings so that everyone is on the same page, giving a sense of solidarity that is especially important when dealing with the clients we work with.  We also send out daily written logs to all of our staff so that we can keep abreast of everything that has happened every day.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for Growth - Any time a position has opened up throughout the company, it is first offered to employees who are already here.  I am comfortable in my current position but feel confident that if I ever want to move up, I will be able to do so.\r\n\r\nWork Worth Doing - Working with mental health patients is a special challenge, but definitely something that is worth all the hard work our staff puts into each and every day.  \r\n\r\nAppreciation - Nothing makes a job happier than feeling like you're appreciated!  I've worked under two different supervisors and both have taken the time on a few occasions to just shoot me a quick email thanking me.  It's a small, simple gesture that really made my day!  Our coordinator recently sent a mass email thanking all of us who stepped up to fill in for a sick employee - so nice to know that when our team works together, it's noticed and appreciated!", "cons": "Pay - The pay isn't great, just a little bit above minimum wage.
