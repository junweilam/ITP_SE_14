The one job you couldn\u2019t offer me enough money in the world to return to is Career Services at Remington. I\u2019ve never woken up sick to my stomach in the morning for any other job. The president walked in every morning to look me over and see what I was wearing - always professional, always the right length, always appropriate. But every morning, I was given the once over. So was my team. The phones are bugged; meetings are listened in on. Reviews with the regional president are nightmarish. He tells you how to prepare then does the opposite of what he says he will do. He sat in the back of a dark room and degraded my team, my progress, everything I did while I had to look ahead and was advised not to turn around to speak to him. I was told what colors to wear on those review days. I was told not to wear lotion or perfume or too much jewelry because it \u201coffended him\u201d. While being spoken to like an idiot, I was told to just sit there and listen and never talk back. What kind of workplace is that? As for the work scope - it\u2019s impossible. If 100 kids graduate, you\u2019re expected to place 100 kids in jobs. If you place 99, they ask why you didn\u2019t place 100. The problem was places wouldn\u2019t hire Remington students because the education they get isn\u2019t good enough to get them hired. While cold calling to try and place students in jobs, employers would ask what school I was calling from. When I told them Remington, sometimes they would say \u201cwe don\u2019t hire Remington students\u201d. Sometimes they would just hang up. If the regional career services director is feeling pressured enough, they\u2019ll tell you to fudge the numbers - and they\u2019re ALWAYS feeling pressured. Remington is an awful diploma mill and every location should be forced to shut its doors. Please avoid it. You won\u2019t last long anyway - they don\u2019t keep anyone long. When they do let you go, they\u2019ll make you sign a document that states that nothing unethical is happening at Remington and that you never witnesses anything that could be deemed unethical.
