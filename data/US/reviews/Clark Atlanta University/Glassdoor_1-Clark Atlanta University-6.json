The people they have in these so-called \"Officer\" positions do nothing but try to dump their work off onto other people and pretend like they're busy when they do ABSOLUTELY nothing. These officers (especially the Chief Development Officer) constantly make excuses for not performing their duties; however, they'll turn around and expect one coordinator to carry the load. When it becomes too much, they'll try to say you're having trouble with \"prioritizing\" or \"time management\" and will do nothing to contribute. You can only claim lack of resources, low budget, and \"the way things are\" for so long...the working conditions should NEVER be that way - and they wouldn't be if the leaders LEAD and do their jobs. I performed two jobs with multiple people to report to on a meager salary. The hypocrisy and lack of respect is palpable.\r\n\r\nThe \"me above you\" mentality runs deep here. When you call supervisors out about their behavior & decisions, they'll be quick to pull you from projects (to make it look as if you're not performing everything in your job description), write you up on egregious accusations, and take advantage of the system to make your experience difficult. My job was threatened multiple times due to fallacious claims before they conspired with HR to wrongfully terminate me because I wouldn't play into their hand and HR and my former bosses made up lies to cover their own tracks. \r\n\r\nHR is antiquated & complacent, gives the \"runaround\" about corrective action, and will flip the script to side with supervisors giving employees unfair treatment. \r\n\r\nNot to mention that this is very little order and structure within this department and they're not doing an adequate job generating or handling funds to the point where they can barely fund their PhD students.
