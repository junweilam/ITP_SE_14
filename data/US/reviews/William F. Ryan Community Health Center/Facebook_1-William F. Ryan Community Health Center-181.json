Honestly!! The Administration is horrible. They are a bunch of bullies and gangsters. No matter how hard their employees work, they don't give them any respect or signs of gratitude. All they do is bully you and threaten you with unemployment. They don't treat you like a very hard working adult. We have lost great Nurses, Pediatricians, Specialists, and Receptionist for no good reason. They have no reluctance to fire anyone, no matter what their title.  The turn over rate of all employees is faster than at McDonalds.  When you go to a place and hear that this person is new and that person has been here for a couple of months then you know there is a problem.  The Pediatric Director will boost about how long a couple of the Pediatricians and Nurses have worked for the Center (A COUPLE!) -- but will fail to tell you how many Doctors, Nurses, and Receptionist have left, or how many they have fired. They were GREAT workers too!!!  Three of the Pediatricians within the past year have even sued them because they were VERY WRONGFULLY fired.  Yeah, ask about all that if you are going to interview. They WILL call you for an interview too because they are terribly short staffed. The patients are even tired of the high turnover rate of Physicians and many of them have left the center because of it. Continuity is lacking!  They don't care how hard any of their employees work or how late they  stay each day in order to provide quality care to their patients. They just have the 'ON TO THE NEXT ONE' attitude.  If you don't believe this review, ask them BEFORE your interview about the  high turn over rate of Pediatricians, Specialists, Nurses, and Receptionists.   The Administration can care less about complaints from the patients or the staff.  As long as they can bill Medicaid or any other health insurance they are happy.  \r\nTheir motto, \"Health Care is a right, not a Privilege\" sounds great but Treating Their Employees with respect should be a Right and not a Privilege too!!! Congressman William F. Ryan must be  rolling over in his grave.  Trust me, don't waste your time with this place. Visit if you want and talk to the staff. They are not happy at all.  I'm tired of the high turn over rate and the VERY wrongful write-ups of the staff. After the holidays I am going to happily \r\nresign!!  That will be a gift to myself. I would tell you to print out this review and ask the Doctors, Nurses, front desk staff, custodians, and security guards to comment on it but they \r\nprobably won't give you an honest answer because they know the bullies will be after them. People have children to feed and bills to pay so giving you, a stranger, the 'Heads Up' may  not be in their best interest (no matter how badly they want to tell you the truth).  Seriously, keep looking.

Condescending air. \r\n\r\nOne particular example: If you clock in even ONE minute late in your first six months, you may be fired on the spot; management reminds employees of this regularly. Given this, I would try to arrive at least 15-20 minutes early. I was never late and never missed a day. However, on occasion, I arrived early to work (by only 15 minutes) in order to be sure I was never late and subsequently not fired. After arriving to my office about 15-20 minutes early I was questioned about why I was arriving early. I was told that employees are not allowed to arrive early because it \"looks suspicious.\" Human Resources actually asked, \"Why on earth would you want to arrive to work early?\" I asked, \"What do I do when it's snowing outside, trains are delayed, and I can't be one minute late? If I arrive 15-20 minutes early, what do I do? Can I really not come in when the building is open, my office and desk are open and jsut sitting there, and others have already started their shift?\" Their reply: \"I guess you'll have to freeze outside in the snow.\"\r\n\r\nAnother example: I genuinely had the flu. I worked in a department with patients with a compromised immune system. I was not allowed to call in sick because I had \"only\" been working there for 4 months--and had never been late or missed a day. (Their probation period is 6 months, and during this time you are reminded that you are dispensable and can be fired on the spot at any moment if you break policy.) I was instructed to go into the office and \"prove\" that I had the flu. I was told that if I did not go into the office, I might be fired. I went into the office. To prove my illness, I coughed all over my supervisors.  While I gladly enjoyed coughing all over the supervisors who required me to come in as proof of my illness, I was appalled that I could not be trusted as an employee and that the organization would risk having an employee endangering the health of others by being forced to come in when contagious with an airborne, communicable illness."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst place I have ever worked at.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Patient Service Representative in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I\u2019ve met some great people along the way, that I can truly call my friends.", "cons": "The challenges I\u2019ve encounter here are, once you make a mistake, you become a target.
