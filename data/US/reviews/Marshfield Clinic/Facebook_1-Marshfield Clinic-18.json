MC has doubled in size over the past 20 years, and there has been an associated huge increase in management positions, most of which do not directly answer to physician supervision. At all levels we have disconnections between the care we try to provide and the management structure. For instance we have odd situations like the inability to make changes in the letters we send to patients when they receive an appointment or to change the staff process for making appointments because physicians cannot get the attention of middle level managers, and middle level managers have no real authority. Physicians are leaving at a rate never seen before (in the past stability of physician pool has been high) as production pressures increase and increased production requirements serve as a mechanism to cut salaries. Thus physicians are under intense production pressure with a management that is self-maintaining and apparently incapable of addressing core inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nThere are droves of attorneys in management positions, in my view an important cause of a change in culture over the past ten years from one in which physician voices were heard and respected to one in which physicians and other employees are treated with equal disrespect and disregard for their work environment and the role the work environment plays in overall quality of life.

Sadly, they are overworked, under appreciated, and poorly utilized by management.", "cons": "Took this job right out of fellowship and worked there for almost 4 years.  Honestly, the best decision I made about this place was to leave.  \r\n\r\nThere is too much micromanagement from the top down.  Middle managers and administrators make EVERYTHING a battle.  This all comes down to the \"old boy\" network and bullying culture promoted by the system.  \r\n\r\nAlso, because service waits are long, customer service poor, and the location inconvenient, Marshfield Clinic has ceded A LOT of ground/market share to Aspirus and their other competitors in Wausau. This has resulted in a poor payer mix and increasingly non-compliant, entitled, and difficult patients.  Meaning you're often finding yourself fighting an uphill battle on the patient care front, as well.\r\n\r\nPhysician/provider burn-out rates here were abnormally high to begin with and only got worse as Marshfield Clinic sunk further and further into financial strain and insolvency.  Retention is exceedingly poor and getting worse year after year.  Most providers were looking for new jobs when I was there and many have left in the time since my departure.  Those that remain are merely getting their ducks lined in a row before announcing their intent to leave for better, more stable work environments.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is they can't be trusted to hold true to the terms of a salary agreement.  This means that the negotiated production rate/RVU basis that you've negotiated for the upcoming year can NEVER be counted on to be what you actually receive.  Invariably, well after the fact, changes are unilaterally made in favor of the Marshfield Clinic.  What this means for providers is that they are working harder and harder, and while they generate more revenue for the Marshfield Clinic, they are taking home less for themselves.  This also contributes significantly to the high provider burn out rate and also means that you're seeing so many patients that patient care suffers.\r\n\r\nFinally, the computer record system here, which was state of the art in 1997, hasn't kept pace with technologic advancement.  It's the EHR equivalent of being an AOL user in 2014.  Because MCIS is so poorly managed and run, they will never be able to catch up or keep pace with the advances and changes that are necessary to put together an efficient and facile EHR product."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Director in Marshfield, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people are awsome.

What a mistake!!\r\n\r\n-The city is ok.  It is isolated from large urban areas as it is in rural WI, but that was not what made my time with MC unbearable.\r\n\r\n-The staff, for the most part, is very friendly.  However, there were a significant number of MAs and RNs who made life a nightmare for physicians and other staff.  Their attitude was dismal and their respect for patients and HIPPA non-existent.  Many times I found them discussing protected health information between themselves while at lunch in a public location.  Even after I informed the clinic management, nothing was done about it.  This is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n-The management is utterly useless.  Concerns are not handled in a confidential manner and no results/consequences are ever discussed.  In fact, decisions are made behind closed doors by HR, management and lawyers for the company before the employee is even aware that there is any type of complaint against them.  The employee is not contacted or has a chance to give his/her side of the story at all.  Once the decision is made, he/she is told of the results.  Not  good for morale.\r\n\r\n-Clinic morale was at a low during this past year.  There were numerous staff cuts (which were not disclosed to staff until after it was printed in a local newspaper) to different departments which made things worse in regards to clinic flow during the day.  Many times I had to share a MA during the day with another physician.  Poor girl was running around like a mad woman trying to juggle 4 exam rooms.  \r\n\r\n-Division medical directors (DMDs) are out of touch with the physicians who are actually working with patients.  They have no idea what their long term goals are.  They spend an enormous amount of time micromanaging and focusing on minutia that they miss the forest for the trees.  The amount of time spent on salary discussions for individual physicians is ridiculous.  They are unwilling to meet personally, instead choosing to deal mostly via email.  In fact, a lot of the time, phone calls and messages go unanswered for weeks.\r\n\r\n-Once again, DMDs only inform the employees of decisions once they have been made, usually by email, even if it is bad news.  No one is willing to speak face to face.\r\n\r\n-DMDs do not want you to develop your own plan for your professional development. Since they themselves do not know what they want, they can't tolerate providers making decisions about how to expand and grow their practice.  You ideas will be dismissed.\r\n\r\n-Others have talked about a bullying culture at this organizations.  This is true. Not only does it happen from the top down, but also amongst the same level employees. The best performers are only rewarded with more work, not promotions or wage increase and those people who are mediocre  at their job are often  promoted due to their seniority in the organization.\r\n\r\n-The situation has gotten so bad, that numerous physicians have left within the past year, with me being one of them.  The smaller centers have almost no specialty coverage and a lot of the ones they had, are now gone."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Work Assessement", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Rice Lake, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Managers are as flexible as they can be.
