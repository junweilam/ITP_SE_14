Test it out, if you are a minority, ask them about their retention rates (especially of minoritized groups), you\u2019ll see who they are immediately. \r\n\r\nPeople here value their titles more than human-centered approaches. You will be tossed aside and thrown out if you try and exercise any inkling of empowerment because this place will rob you of it. \r\n\r\nSave for some of the folks who actually know how to do their jobs, the place is full of paper-pushers, who have mastered the art of \u2018email forwarding\u2019, and passing the buck on to the next person who also does not know how to do their job. If you want something taken care of by any department, be prepared for a long wait, with most just forgetting they are employed at this place, or others who think they\u2019re too good or too important to respond to you. \r\n\r\nThe treatment you\u2019ll get from some departments is nothing short of inhumane that I don\u2019t know how an institution like this has proceeded to operate for so long with their cruelties and yet pass themselves as a \u2018student-centered\u2019 institution. If that\u2019s the case, why are their enrollments continually dropping and students are pursing legal action against this place? \r\n\r\nIf you get a job offer or an interview with this University: RUN. You\u2019ll be robbed of soul, life, dignity, and a chance at better pay compared to industry standards, it is a true bait and switch. For instructors, the pay is abysmal for terminally degreed workers. Pay is nearly half of related-industry standards, and for staff, at least 35%+ lower than most other industry professionals, which is not a living wage in the state of CA. However, this is not the case with their leaders, Director level and above are paid their market value.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is adequate as a starter institution, but stay longer than 4+ years and you\u2019ll stagnate fast, as their adherence to the archaism of outdated institutions dulls their sharpness and leaves them inept at competing against an ever-evolving educational marketplace."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The university does not care about their employees", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Campus Safety Officer in La Verne, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Tuition remission but with restrictions", "cons": "Low pay and horrible organizational culture"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Fun place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "21 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Adjunct Faculty in La Verne, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is very respectful and nice.

The quality of the students (below CSU level, way below) and generally the faculty is not great either. Adjuncts range in quality hugely- as recruitment is based on who you are friends with. Most of the full time faculty couldn't get a job anywhere else, they like to pretend they are there as they really want to support first gen students, but that is BS, they are really just not up to the measure to work elsewhere. The professional staff tend to be better- but it is really hard to get fired so who knows. \r\n\r\nCult of personality- so the entire place is small and run via personality driven decision making. There is no accountability (literally no process for a yearly review and faculty have no review after tenure) so it is really irrelevant how well you do your job. You are surrounded by people who are working as they have a friend of relative who got them the job, they are related to a manager, or they graduated from ULV. \r\n\r\nStaffing- so most complain about understaffing, and that is part of the problem, but it is more that there are not enough competent people to do the work. There are areas that are thinly staffed, but for the most part there are just people who need to be fired so someone who can do the job can be hired. It is not really capacity as much as capability. \r\n\r\nPay- low, lower than other places, but if you aren't doing any work then maybe you are being overpaid? There has also historically been issues with people brought on at different salary levels, literally with no consistency so there are people who are grossly overpaid and others who are hugely underpaid. The biggest issue was people being paid as \"receptionists\" when they were really doing coordination work- to save about $7,000 a year. \r\n\r\nLack of management- so there are two forms of management. Over-promoted internal staff- who actually care about ULV but probably don't know what they are doing or External recruits who are supposed to be bringing best practice (highly questionable if that is happening) and are there just long enough to get the promotion on the resume, get on the conference circuit and get another job. Neither is good, I am not sure which is worse. The later has been a real issue as of late due to attempts to get big projects for a media splash- rather than quality and consistent education. \r\n\r\nInternal policies- not followed if they exist at all. Jobs don't even float internally, you just find out about a promotion/new role for someone's favorite later. Really unprofessional and no training for these newly promoted managers."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Research Assistant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Duarte, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Checks paid on time, direct deposit, great working with other faculty, brilliant students, help engage the community", "cons": "Sometimes there were limits on how many hours one could work per week, and if your hours went over you they would not roll over"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Head Coach", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Head Coach in La Verne, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great University, expanding campus, fantastic location, diverse student body population, the campus offers a small town feel while numerous attractions are a short drive away.", "cons": "Tuition rates seem to raise each year while tuition assistance and financial aid seem harder and harder to acquire."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Toxic Work Environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Information Security Officer in La Verne, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-403b 10% university matching + 5% mandatory employee matching.\r\n-generous sick leave (1 day/mo.) + PTO (22 days/year) + paid vacation between Christmas & New Years\r\n-there are some nice folks here\r\n-flexible hours for the most part\r\n-it is rewarding to help students learn new concepts & to be given occasional opportunities to speak to students", "cons": "-salary below industry standard\r\n-many tenured faculty encountered were extremely rude, immature, and resistant to anything technological changes necessary to improve the information security posture of the university.\r\n-even within the Office of Information Technology (OIT), there are several folks who've worked there a long time that are unwilling to listen to desperately needed security recommendations because they are so set in their processes which made for a toxic work environment.\r\n-unwillingness of management to resolve disputes between lower-level employees when conflicts arose which affected ability to perform stated role.\r\n-unwillingness by nearly all faculty to attend mandatory information security training despite the fact this group of employees needs it the most.\r\n-faculty senate is a toxic plague that is infecting every aspect of the university as tenured faculty complain about every aspect of administration and demand that they be given special treatment and a say in every major policy or decision.
