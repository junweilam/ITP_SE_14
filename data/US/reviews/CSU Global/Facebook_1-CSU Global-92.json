I know for a fact that current employees added their reviews to try and boost CSU-Global\u2019s glassdoor score. This is not conjecture \u2013 they told me they did it. They are not honest reviews and that\u2019s why they aren\u2019t detailed. \r\n\r\n Anyway, I don\u2019t normally leave reviews, ever, however I feel compelled to warn the world about this place and the harm that it causes. I waited until the emotional PTSD from this company wore off before I wrote my review so that I could be sure that my review was honest. And in ALL HONESTY\u2026run for the hills if you\u2019re offered a job here. Seriously, you\u2019ll thank me (and all of the other reviewers who said so) later. I've know multiple people who left here and needed medication or therapy, not joking. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s so much to warn you against but in an effort to keep it as short as possible, let me sum it up for you. I\u2019ve never worked at a company where so many people leave against their will (ie, they are fired or laid off). I distinctly remember that during the first all-staff meeting I attended, Dr. Becky said that they expect everyone to work hard (an understatement) and not expect to be paid much (a truthful statement) and if you don\u2019t like it, you can leave. She then proceeded to start almost every meeting that way for the years I worked here. Clearly, it's a churn and burn mentality. \r\n\r\nAnd that, right there, is the crux of the problem with CSU-Global. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, is dispensable. It does not matter how hard you work, how many hours you put in, the title you achieve, even how ethically you approach your job\u2026you mean nothing to Dr. Becky. CSU-Global likes to put its people into positions that they are not prepared for, not provide any training or resources and then when they, inevitably, fail, fire them and get someone else to do the work instead. Never once do they stop and ask what they are doing wrong? That\u2019s the first sign of insanity, right? Doing the same thing and expecting a different result\u2026Dr. Becky will never take responsibility for the awful conditions she both tolerates and perpetuates. Why? Well, she gets \u201cresults,\u201d according to the Board of Governors. And, apparently, they don\u2019t seem to mind who she mutilates in order to get those results. \r\n\r\nIntrospection and self awareness are foreign terms to Dr. Becky, she's the most clueless person in the university. The most ironic part is that NO ONE tells her anything, they hide most of the issues from her because they know that as soon as she finds out, she'll overreact and start reorganizing and firing. This literally just happened to an entire department THAT WASN'T BROKEN - their numbers were better than most universities...but she overpromised and underdelivered and had to throw someone under the bus. For example, she has no idea that the student management system has been in shambles for over a year. She doesn't know half of the systems are broken or partially working, making everyone's job more difficult. I sat through meeting after meeting where there were plans about HOW to hide things from her. Honestly, she's a joke and a cancer to a university that could be great.

Everyone is miserable, and you always feel like management is mad at you, and you don't know why. I've been told that other if anyone complains about how the president is treating them, they're fired. They do firings twice a year, and they never give a reason other than \"restructuring.\" And it's usually whole groups of people at once.

They did what was asked of them in order to succeed in the university. New management came in and the structure shifted to the for-profit model of chasing students and calling multiple times a day. But, don't you dare point that out to management. The type of student they are marketing to now is the student who wants a free laptop or pell jumper. If you don't have serious students and want to keep introducing new plans like focusing on Freshmen and selling specific degrees, you should just admit you are now a for-profit who focuses more on quantity than quality. \r\n\r\nMeetings are all about how to sell different degrees but we shouldn't be pushing students to get a certain degree. It is all about numbers of dials and talk time. The same people are recognized and it feels gross to have to waste an hour of your day each week to listening to the same names being recognized for numbers, numbers, numbers. If you don't hit high numbers every term, you are on a warning and can expect the pressure of whether or not you will have a job next month. \r\n\r\nIt used to be fun to go in and see co-workers, but there are so many now that no one knows anyone else. The new management has hired double the amount of counselors who are pushy sales people instead of those who listen to what the student actually needs. I've heard it first hand and had students thank me for being honest and recommending alternative options instead of forcing them to spend more money or time if CSU-Global is not the best fit for them at this time. It's best to go in, do your job and go home. They have created a very competitive environment among employees and it's very uncomfortable. We used to hang out with one another outside of work, but that changed with doubling the number of counselors and creating teams that compete against each other. They are putting attention into these games where you're against other counselors instead of working as a team. \r\n\r\nYou take home a lot of stress and anxiety because you want to do what is best for your students (the whole reason for the university!), but you have to hit other matrix numbers in order to be there. I used to know my students much better before we switched our management structure. That place made me a very angry, antisocial, stressed out person. The second I left, I felt a huge weight lifted and I feel I can be happy again. I'm not alone.
