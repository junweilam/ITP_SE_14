No support for the position due to some hidden baggage in the department and in the administration. I've been at Park for 7 years and the last Director of Campus Safety was excellent but he quietly went away like all of the others. This is a university that is a cancer to itself. The new president is not being told what is really going on. There is no priority for safety here. Great example is that the Director of Safety reports to the head of maintenance. There are people concerned about their safety here but Campus Safety is not allowed to talk about issues. I don't recommend this position or any other. There is no job security here.
