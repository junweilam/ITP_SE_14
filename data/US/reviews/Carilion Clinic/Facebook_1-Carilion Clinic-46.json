Since they don't have the technical knowledge to disprove the information they're giving, they're likely under the impression everything is totally fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nVendors completely walk all over everyone. No one will change contracts, despite whatever solution in place being riddled with issues. There's a few exceptions where it reached a boiling point and solutions were changed, but they're few and far between. Expect repeat, fixable problems to occur ad-nauseam until specific doctors making over a million dollars a year (no joke, go check the publicly available 990 forms) complain about it. Bonus points if they wake you up at 3 in the morning. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a handful of individuals, information security is not really taken seriously. Systems are left in vulnerable states for months (even years occasionally) at a time unless the issue is so egregious they have zero choice. The attention given is quite random and follows no real contextual priority system. It took a very long time to get simple, industry standard controls into place that should have been present 5-10 years prior. If this is something you value as a part of your M.O., I would probably look elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou get a lot of PTO, but you'll never be able to take it all. I'm pretty sure they're aware of this as well, which is why they let you \"cash-out\" the PTO. This is actually cool, so I won't complain too much here, but the premise remains that you're not gonna get your full time off if your job has any sort of business-dependency. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you upset someone or have too much of a disagreement with someone who's above you in TSG or in a clinical role, despite no matter how correct you are, you WILL be railroaded out of there by HR. This didn't happen to me, but I personally did witness several individuals have the HR department weaponized against them when they rocked the boat a bit too much. This creates an openly malicious workplace environment for anyone who tries to speak up about potential ethical issues. Which there are many of.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess-heavy CAB allows essentially nothing of real importance to get done at the urgency it needs to. In some cases, this is okay, as it does avoid potential issues. Most of the time it's just a way for non-technical leadership to try and insert themselves into technical issues to look important. This is incredibly obvious by the fact that specific changes, such as major networking infrastructure reworks, are ALWAYS immediately approved despite carrying higher risk than, say, someone changing a text field on a web application. Specific managers make a concerted effort to always involve themselves with changes that they have little knowledge of, and are by no means subject matter experts. Instead of deferring to said subject matter experts, their word is often taken at face value since they \"talk the talk\" well. Certain groups are given much more scrutiny than others, which follow no real pattern and are almost certainly arbitrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's an ongoing joke within TSG that the solution to all problems they have is to hire more directors. The amount of bloat in middle-management is astonishing. Larger than any other place I've personally, or anyone else I personally know. This includes seasoned, veteran systems administrators with decades of experiences in similar size environments. It's like the joke from Office Space where Peter tells his interviewers that he has 8 bosses. There are, depending on your org chart and where you sit, more managers and directors over your department than actual teammates doing the real work. Some teams are randomly overstaffed, many are randomly understaffed. It follows no rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever expect low-performing, decadent, repeat-offender, and frankly, lazy employees to be disciplined in any sort of serious manner. I knew of an individual who had quite literally done 3 hours of work in an entire month, and it was proven to leadership that this was the case, and they still did nothing about it. In one instance, I witnessed an individual flagrantly and egregiously defying directives from leadership and without revealing too much information, was clearly not doing their job. Everyone knew this, including management, and it still took them 6 months before anything was done about it and they were separated from the company. Most other companies, the 2nd or 3rd instance of this type of behavior would have been met with swift action. Carilion, will quite literally forgive you for anything, unless you make them look bad externally or to clinical executives.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll wrap up with this - it's possible that every single concern I mentioned above has been fixed in the couple of years I've been gone, but I highly doubt it. I still speak with many of my former colleagues that presently work at Carilion and the consensus is business as usual."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Nurse Practitioner in Salem, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "understanding about time off from work", "cons": "more hours worked than paid given salary"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Attendant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Nursery Attendant in Roanoke, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great community to be a part of, they hire the right type of people", "cons": "The hiring process is lengthy"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "CC ED", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Emergency Department Registered Nurse in Roanoke, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good teamwork, great pay, great vacation pto amount, sign on bonus, good nurse residency program.", "cons": "I have not found any yet."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Food Services Supervisor in Galax, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hours are more than flexible", "cons": "Poor advancement opportunities to move up"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "good job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Nursing Assistant in Roanoke, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Time off, PTO, benefits.

Almost everyone I worked with - clinical or otherwise - was enthusiastic about the work, largely out of a desire to care for our patients and communities. People saw their job as either directly or indirectly serving their families, friends, neighbors, etc. who walked through our doors.  Team members here truly lived the organization's stated values too. Working through tough strategic and operational problems is far easier with that sort of alignment.\r\n\r\nPeople at Carilion were on the whole quite creative, eager to solve problems, and willing to go \"above and beyond\" if it helps our patients. Most staff I worked with were laid-back and friendly too; it reflected well on Southwest VA. It was an easy place to build good professional relationships.\r\n\r\nSalary, benefits, etc. were competitive for the market. Work life balance was quite good for a large healthcare system, at least on the business/administrative end where I worked. PTO and retirement benefits were particularly solid.\r\n\r\nTools and technology on the business side were not ideal, but better than many other healthcare organizations (the industry usually lags others in this area).\r\n\r\nThe organization was quick to highlight outstanding work by team members, particularly in areas like quality, safety, or patient-centric care. \r\n\r\nCarilion was also pretty forward-thinking as a healthcare organization, despite not being in a market where reimbursement pushed it to do so. Senior management was frequently open to trying new approaches, even if just to learn on a small scale.", "cons": "Carilion is a large organization, with that comes the inevitable bureaucracy, siloes, and communication challenges. Change did not always happen fast, and various parts of the organization were sometimes caught unaware of what others were up to.\r\n\r\nTeam members were full of ideas. Unfortunately that enthusiasm sometimes led to competing projects, communication issues, strong pressure for scope creep, and demand bottlenecks among the IT, finance, analytics, and other shared services staff responsible for supporting projects. Better coordination and prioritization of initiatives is essential. Senior leadership was working on this when I departed.\r\n\r\nCarilion expanded rapidly over a 15-year period. Many site and practices retain elements of their pre-Carilion selves. This preserves some good elements of their cultures (e.g. the neighborly feel in our rural hopsitals) but can also make Carilion  feel like a loose alliance rather than a true health system.  Senior management exacerbates this sometimes by being too \"Roanoke-centric\", i.e. focusing on the big tertiary medical center to the extent it assumes what works for RMH/CMC will work for other sites.\r\n\r\nPhysician alignment with health system goals was a work in progress when I was there, due in part to the rapid acquisitions described above. \r\n\r\nThere were disconnects (as exists in most health systems) between administration / clinical leadership and front line clinical staff, who were frequently unaware of major priorities. There were also disconnects between Carilion (historically a community health system used to running lean and moving relatively quickly) and the increasing alignment with Virginia Tech School of Medicine (academia loves process, rigor, and gold-plated solutions).\r\n\r\nLastly, the senior leadership team preferred a \"read and react\" approach rather than committing to strategic plans.

Manager comes off very rude and sometimes a bully to the employees, and hardly ever gives lunch breaks due to \"being short staffed\".

Manager does not care about you work/life balance at all, wants you to put this job first above all your personal needs and life at all times even if you are sick or have kids or health conditions that require medical treatment. It is extremely hard to get time off in this position unless you call out and use one of your 4-5 occurrences for the year. There always is a need for \"mandatory overtime\" where the manager makes all the employees work at LEAST 2-3 hours of overtime per week. The turnover rate is tremendous, and the department is always short staffed. Manager says she is not allowed to hire more people and we have to make do with the amount of staff we have (which is NOT enough for the work load).
