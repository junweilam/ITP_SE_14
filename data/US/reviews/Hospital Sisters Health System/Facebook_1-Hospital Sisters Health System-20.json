I think my Christmas bonus was $10 ( no, not kidding- they give employees \"points\" as appreciation, and then the points are loaded onto an employee appreciation shopping site. It's like Chucke cheese gifts for adults, and you need over 100000 points for something nice, such as a gemstone sterling silver necklace. I received 2500 or 3000 points in a card in the mail.
