Changes in policy are not well communicated, and senior management seems to operate without a long-term plan, meaning changes are frequent and arbitrary. There are some really interesting ideas here about how to change health care but unfortunately Steward seems to think it can implement its ideas by being a bully both to its own employees and to external parties with whom it should be developing relationships. \r\n\r\nThere is also a serious lack of work-personal life boundaries here which begins with our CEO and again trickles down through senior management. Non-urgent manners are expected to take your immediate attention on weekends and evenings and no vacation is safe from calls from the boss.
