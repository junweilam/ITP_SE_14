I love my project and my boss, and would totally stay here forever if it weren't for missing city life.\r\n\r\nThe area is quite beautiful, 90 minutes from Pittsburgh, 3.5 hours from DC, close to skiing, lots of hiking, and tons of whitewater rafting.\r\n\r\nNote that WVU and WVURC are separate and have different policies for benefits. I can't speak to what WVU does, but WVURC has a reasonably good 403(b) (like 401(k)) matching policy \u2014 3% is matched! They give merit raises, which is nice, and I didn't expect that at such a large institution.\r\n\r\nMorgantown has reasonably good restaurants for a small college town.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of opportunities for advancement \u2014 and tons of possible collaborators. People don't come here by accident (you have to really love what you do to work in the middle of no where).", "cons": "There are extremely few post-doctoral fellows at WVU/WVURC. The University does nothing to help you connect with others, and seems to actively go out of its way to make you feel like you're not a member of the community. Your ID card, if you're a post-doc, actually says on it, \"Not a WVU employee.\" You have to really work to find yourself a community and a place here.\r\n\r\nThis town has a serious problem with housing for single young professionals. In twelve months, I had three bad housing situations \u2014\u00a0they treat you like a student. This probably isn't an issue if you have a family \u2014\u00a0you're in a different segment of the community.\r\n\r\nThe WVURC prescription drug co-pay is insane. You have to pay 30%, which is a ton of money even with some generics.\r\n\r\nThe bureaucracy can be frustrating. I found it difficult to check out library books, even though research is ostensibly my job.\r\n\r\nWVU lacks certain key journal subscriptions and its librarians are not \u2014 for some reason \u2014 able to obtain requested journals. (This is partially mitigated by the relative promptness of WVU's Interlibrary Loan service.)\r\n\r\nThe only thing to do after work is drink, particularly in the winter.\r\n\r\nPublic transit is terrible. I've seen the buses try to run over passengers. The PRT is inconsistent during the winter. Traffic is terrible for such a small town, and there are potholes everywhere. In other words, getting to and from work is a pain.\r\n\r\nThe Engineering campus is a food desert.
