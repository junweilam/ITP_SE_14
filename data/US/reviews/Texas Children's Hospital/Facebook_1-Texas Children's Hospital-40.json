Once I saw them open a position, tell only a clearly favored nurse, and as soon as they applied they took down the position. It\u2019s just silly.

I write this now because I want to share my experience on this forum to give you information that will help you make an informed decision based on a bigger picture. \r\n\r\nHelpful facts to know: \r\nThe administration at Texas Childrens Hospital utilizes guilt, shame and fear based management.\r\nA director was fired from her position because of her racial and homophobic slurs towards her employees and towards patients staying in the hospital. Employees at TCH verbally abuse patients and their parents. (There are also (thank God) amazing people who care) \r\nMy experience:\r\nI challenged the status quo and stood out from the crowd in intelligence and personality. This made me a target for bullying. I was silenced with intimidation. I was no longer given opportunities to advance in the workplace. Every aspect of my work, whether on paper or the time I went to lunch and returned was under constant scrutiny. The only way I could have avoided the backlash was to take part in the toxic behavior by way of gossiping and sabotaging my coworkers. I could not be that way. I believe in collaboration and lifting each other up. I believe in the best in people. This is the saddest truth that I never really want to see. When I talk to the friends who left TCH, I see that our experience at TCH left a mark so deep in us that it has taken 2 years to recover and heal from the stress and anxiety we had from working there. When we left we didn\u2019t know how to be, what was acceptable behavior and what wasn\u2019t. We had to relearn ourselves and to this day have PTSD from our experiences.
