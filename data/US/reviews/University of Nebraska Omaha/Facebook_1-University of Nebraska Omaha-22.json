There may be some \"quiet quitting\" here and there, but I think it is largely due to exhaustion (see below) and generally not to poor leadership or half-hearted employees. The current Chancellor (since 2021) is enthusiastic, organized, and efficient (and one of the most genuine motivational speakers I've ever heard) is streamlining departments to coordinate better effect change for the educational, research, and service aspects of the university. Although challenging, it has been exciting and I look forward to seeing real synergy across units, stronger student services, and better educational results. There really are a lot of innovative teaching and research activities going around campus that make it feel like an exciting and world-changing place. It is a diverse place to work with a pretty diverse student body: 5500 1st generation students (of 15,000 study body of grad/undergrad students) which makes up 41% of the undergraduate student body. 4000+ students are from under-represented areas. Administrators are often open to new ideas if they reach the right person at a good time, and there are always new centers, programs, and projects that can tackle challenges or promote importantly ideas or changes. It also means as staff that there are occasionally ways to move around or up into new types of roles or positions for special programs, which universities may not always be able to offer given the fairly flat administrative structure and limited advancement opportunities in Higher Ed overall.", "cons": "UNO is 3rd on the list of priorities for the Board of Regents, and although the only urban public university in Nebraska with amazing connections to businesses, internships, research opportunities, and non-profit communities, departments and units must be incredibly sparing with funds for anything. The limited funds means that many departments are unable to invest faculty or staff time into as projects and special programs. In some places it means there are long delays in getting paperwork processed, updating systems needs, or accessing information. In areas where there is limited staffing for student resources, it also means communication is not always strong or very efficient - to students or faculty/staff - and tracking of resources or their efficiency is more than likely lacking or fragile, occurring because of a person in a department who wants to make sure it happens rather than an institutional oversight process that can offer more resources or longevity after that person is not longer there. Most often the funding challenges mean that people are always asked to do a lot, and while UNO is a great place to find passional people who care about people, education, and communities, that also makes it a place to find people who feel on edge, exhausted, overwhelmed, or fraying around the edges."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Adjunct Status", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Rewarding to help shape students perspective for entering the job market and defining critical job skills", "cons": "4 times salary improvement for Instructor position teaching 2 more classes per semester"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "You can progress but very slowly", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "it is located in a city with reasonable costs.", "cons": "Courses are not appropriately developed for the students."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Business Manager in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great staff, benefits, salary, and vacation", "cons": "work pace is slow, having to stay busy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Consider it", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a good place for study", "cons": "City is too cold sometimes."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Rough Diamond", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Undergraduate Assistant in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "(Quick Takes)\n- Great opportunity to make professional connections in Omaha\n- Develop relationships with future professionals \n- gain skills, knowledge, and abilities to address issues like microaggressions, redlining, and other concepts related to poverty and race\n\n(Long take)\nThe Service Learning Academy (SLA) is an excellent place to work.

Other issues include not taking more opportunities for the non-profit to grow. The organization has passed up on opportunities to develop a marketing team, participate in current movements (e.g. pride month, black history month, etc.), and address common internal issues that prevent them from improving.
