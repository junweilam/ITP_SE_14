I felt like I lost my soul working for Stevens Henager.  It's about money first and foremost, don't be fooled otherwise.  They are one of the highest priced for profit colleges.  They have people take out student loans, and then have them take out private loans through the school.  In the end someone likely is going to have a monthly payment to the Fed for $300 and then at least $500 they pay the college for it's in house loan as well.  I've seen admissions reps lie to students to get them to enroll, I've seen them login and do peoples homework in the online classes so they would \"count\" for their start rates, etc.  Stevens Henager just got sued by the Fed because they were stating they were non-profit (The sister college California College of San Diego was and so they tried to state all the college under the College America Brands were). As a job it's a hard sell.... Very expensive, only regional accredited, and they quality of education is less that the competitors. Low Graduation ate (which the college prefers... they make more money if someone is enrolled a year, since they then the student owes the full tuition, but the college doesn't have to pay the teachers, etc.). I worked there two years and by the time I left I was so depressed and felt like I had really taking advantage of people, and help to sell them on something that had so little value. I knew managers who would not even hire Stevens Henager Graduates.  The money is good... but yeah...
