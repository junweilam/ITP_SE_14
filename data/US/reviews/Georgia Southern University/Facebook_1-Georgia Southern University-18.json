When you have to train and retrain senior management on how to manage a small staff you clearly have hired the wrong person. The M&C department continues to lose qualified individuals left and right because of management and everyone (executive management) just looks the other way. Especially when you have other executives asking if management is bi-polar, or has multiple personalities. If you don't mind working in a toxic environment where you are called into your boss' office and questioned on why you don't like them because you didn't ask how they were doing when they were on crutches, then this is the place for you. If you enjoy hearing about your manager (or lack thereof) and their relationships, then this is the place for you. Also, if you don't mind constantly working with HR and filing formal complaints, then this is absolutely the place for you. This department has lost 9 employees in the last year and a half.
