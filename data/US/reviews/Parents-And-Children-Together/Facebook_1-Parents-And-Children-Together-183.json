Absolutely devastating. They promise career advancement and training but will kick you to the curb when you get sick. (The nice teachers that I worked with said they were glad they had a third person in the room and I was doing a good job too. Their jobs are now even harder because there are only two of them again).\n\nAfter I was terminated (on a workday might I add), they had me walk out of the building without letting me say goodbye to the teachers or kids that I worked with, and they wouldn't even let me get my backpack in the classroom on my own. I was just forced to sit outside while someone got it for me. Incredibly humiliating. \n\nPACT is a non-profit, so why didn't they treat me, another human being, with kindness? Did I complain when I saw run-down areas in the building or roaches of all things? No, I didn't. I just cleaned up the areas (dust, bugs, etc.) and gave them the benefit of the doubt because I loved being employed with them.\n\nThis experience with this \"non-profit\" organization has ruined early childhood education for me.
