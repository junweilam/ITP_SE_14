My supervisor her supervisor disparaged existing and former employees to me. In fact, they discussed their disappointment in the performance of an employee in my office (senior to my position) and blamed it on her need for more childcare, which was incredibly inappropriate, if not illegal. Since they were located in different states, and it was just the two of us in this small branch office, they asked me to be a \u201cwatchdog\u201d on this employee. Then I learned the person I was asked to \u201cwatch\u201d had been asked to \u201cwatchdog\u201d me.

Management uses evaluation of coaches and customer service reps to weed out unliked or what they consider to be problem employees. Giving them low scores on evaluations that in my opinion are mostly arbitrary, and based on their own opinions and thoughts. Very inconsistent evaluations from one supervisor to the next. Will purposely try to come up with negatives, just to bring down score if they feel like it, or they want to blacklist someone they don't like.

You'd think they would reward a department that continually brings in cash and works extremely hard for NJH. NOPE! The coaching position is 6$ to 8$ dollars per hour under the proper wage average for that particular job in Denver (researched on Glassdoor and Paysa). They continue to use an excuse that \"it's a non-profit\" which is BS. I've done the research.  Plenty of executives and higher ups making excessive pay, but not the hardest working staff and employees.  Health Insurance, benefits and retirement are not enough to make up for low pay.

The eventual conclusion of this study (which I discovered later) was that management had no issues aside from being overworked.\r\n\r\n- HR is set up to prevent the organization from being sued, and little else.  Complaints about any level of management get quickly dismissed or ignored.  Questions sent to HR often come back with conflicting information, if any information at all.\r\n\r\n- There is a fairly decent amount of money they lose each year to chasing down dead-end projects, hoping to recoup their initial investment.\r\n\r\n- Little to no loyalty towards long-time employees.  I saw several people get \"laid off\" just before their 30th anniversary with the company, just before better retirement packages would've kicked in for them.\r\n\r\n- A salary structure that restricts any employee's pay increase, no matter how their job changes.  Even going from janitor to CEO, your pay increase is limited.  It leads to a feeling that \"the only way to go up is to go away\" from NJ.\r\n\r\n- Lower starting pay than most comparable positions (though in fairness this is largely due to NJ being a non-profit).\r\n\r\n- A bizarre system of employee evaluation and raises where raises are based on annual evaluations, but are often taken away due to the institution's budget that year.  Even when they aren't removed, the maximum raise is close to the average cost-of-living increase per year and has to have all levels of management sign off on it, up to and including the CEO.\r\n\r\n- At the end of every fiscal year while I was there, there were a set of unannounced layoffs throughout the institution.  This leads to a lot of fear and worry around that time of year, and a lot of lesser work immediately afterward as people felt relieved to still have a job.\r\n\r\n- Departments/employees/projects were often moved to other departments and managers on relatively short notice and somewhat illogically, mostly seemingly to increase the size of that department's budget/scope."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Dedicated Staff, Poor Management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "31 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of dedicated staff in all of the departments I interacted with\r\nExcellent patent care\r\nGreat reputation", "cons": "Pay/benefits lower than other hospitals in Denver\r\nLittle to no opportunity for staff development in some areas\r\nMany employees don't feel valued - upper management doesn't seem to take employee concerns seriously"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management uncaring, subpar benefits, uncomfortable work model", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Tobacco Cessation Coach in Glendale, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pays somewhat better than other call centers but that doesn't stop constant turnover", "cons": "Arbitrary rules imposed on employees, favoritism, length of service rewarded over performance ratings, benefits are not great like 401K match only after 2 yrs and subpar Kaiser is the only medical offered, work model method for helping people isn't always suitable"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Fine place to start a career", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Sept 2010", "job_title": "Clinical Technologist in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the nice things about working here are the generous time off, holiday, and sick time policies.
