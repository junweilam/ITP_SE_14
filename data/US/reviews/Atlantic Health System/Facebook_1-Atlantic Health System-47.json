This department is plagued with poor leadership. There is a lot of unprofessionalism in the way matters are handled. Employees aren't spoken to directly if there is an issue. Instead they are gossipped about behind their backs and to other employees and these hunches are used to reprimand staff and bully us into silence. No evidence is needed to be reprimanded. If you are accused of doing something by anyone in leadership, it is taken as the truth and you are ultimately reprimanded for it. Unfair abuse of power. Employees are also encouraged to eavesdrop on each other and bring information to the leaders of the department to get each other written up and fired. Very divisive and juvenile behavior.\r\n\r\nEmails have been sent in the past saying employees were not to smile/laugh with other staff members and not allowed to talk on  the job. This among other ridiculous attempts to keep employees from speaking up against the abuse of power and compliance violations that occur in the department. Speaking out is usually met with threats of firing. Atlantic Health System is allowing this to happen. NO ONE should be allowed to affect an employee's performance appraisal, write up, threaten or fire an employee based on unsubstantiated claims. Performance appraisals should be strictly about the job and one's ability to function effectively in the work environment. I cannot believe that I have been out of high school almost 20 years and it feels like im back dealing with mean girls and bullies.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the turnover that exists in the department is not because people are finding better opportunities. They are in fact fleeing from bullies. They are running away from unprofessionalism, intimidation, threats of firings and their characters being tarnished if they stand up against abuse of power.\r\n\r\nCentral Access at the Overlook medical center needs to be investigated by the administration. This has been happening for a while with different employees but so many people have been bullied into silence and good staff members have resigned to avoid the petty environment so the problem persists.
