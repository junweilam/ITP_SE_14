Especially if there was a fall or sick resident on either assisted living hall or residential hall or the cottages. It's hard to have a hall 20 residents to do CNA , CMT and LPN for. Plus another 30 plus another 50 plus residents you're LPN for. CMTs were great on the other halls of they were good ones and could determine if they needed a PRN med for allergies or constipation. I had the privilege of working with one who passed meds and that was it. If they called me down sh wouldn't even follow up to see if it relieved the symptoms. She was extremely resentful to me as charge nurse at all times. Nothing was ever done about it. She was supposed to have a meeting with the DON and Administrator and I this as way of an apology \"Sorry sometimes I'm a b,----.\". No write up or any punishment of any kind. I went on medical leave for 4 months and told the new acting DON I wanted days or nights but not evenings, which I had been trying to get off of for several months and was passed over for both shifts as they had to find a replacement. Funny thing is they never ran an ad for my position. Anyway, back to my return, I was on nights for 2 weeks before they put me back on evenings even tho I protested. Then when I had another job and gave my notice askeme what it would take for me to stay. I said nights and $3more an hour, exactly what I was getting at the new job. She said nights I can do but not the increase in pay. Funny thing is now they have raised their pay exactly that. I always volunteered for over time and was very dependable although I didn't get that on my last evaluation as the only problem noted. I also had 5 less callouts than another employee that scored a 4 to my 1. I don't think I was the best employee due to alot of medical problems that weren't figured into my missed days. Enough problems that I required whip employees there that time of working there where I was always hired right back there.
