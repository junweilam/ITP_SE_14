This leaves no time for class preparation, emails, and grading unless you can get that done during your office hours.\r\n\r\nIf you are adjunct faculty or if you pick up an additional class, you wont be paid for office hours, prep time, or grading. You are only paid for the time you are in class. This means you are paid for 48 hours of work to teach a 3 credit class that is 6 to 17 weeks long.\r\n\r\nDifficult to take time off during the semester even if family emergencies occur.\r\n\r\nUnder normal schedules, all instructors are paid \"equally\" regardless of course load and number of students. This means you can end up working allot of hours while others work significantly less.\r\n\r\nThe union is kind of useless when it comes to fighting for employee rights. Wages were frozen this past year because of covid so no one got a raise, even if they were supposed to get one (like new employee raises). \r\n\r\nThe teaching contracts were also made more one sided and instructors were forced to sign one sided work from home agreements.\r\n\r\nStudents can be... a handful. This shouldn't be an issue at a college level but it is. WITC does not have a standard when it comes to who they let in. They seem to think referrals and phone calls will fix serious behavior and maturity issues.\r\n\r\nIf you have realistic standards (some will call them high standards) you will have issues here. Basic things like due dates and cheating are a big issue that I feel WITC likes to ignore. \r\n\r\nI've had students rat out other students for cheating because its so common.
