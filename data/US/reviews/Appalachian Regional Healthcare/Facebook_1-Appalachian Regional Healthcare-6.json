"Great coworkers, steady and stable company, benefits are okay.

Further,  if they figure out you are competent you will do your job and  many others as well. It has a tendency to balloon. That further complicates the fact that you are already underpaid. Frustration just builds and builds.\r\nOld school mentality. It definitely depends on who you know if you want to get ahead.  Also how you look and present yourself matters. Can be extremely superficial and fake. They prefer the personality type that will get along to go along, rather than anyone rocking the boat. \r\nCoworkers and environment can be a bit toxic. Gossiping and pettiness. People seem to care more about the title they have rather than actually having a good work ethic or doing a good job. This presents itself as- wanting to take ownership of everything but not actually owning the failures as well as the successes.  Or taking ownership in a superficial way but not actually really owning or understanding tasks. There is a lot of task overlap and a LOT of people not knowing who is supposed to be doing what. Frankly, there seems to be a lot of people that are unneeded and unproductive.  Also, many that are not knowledgeable about the roles they are supposed to be performing.  \r\nOn the flip side, those productive knowledgeable people are really great.  Worked to death but great. \r\n\r\nThere is a bit of staleness.  A little like a time warp.  The mentality that it's how we've always done it and how we will continue to do it.  They have a tendency to not revisit items to see if things have changed or can or should be done differently.  Upper management tends to not want to admit or reverse course when things aren't going well.  Instead they double down. I think there is very much a male dominated mentality that reversing course or changing their mind is seen as weakness. \r\nRather than being proactive, the environment is very much reactive. Example, instead of maintenance to keep things running smoothly, wait until it breaks completely then fix it because you have to. My best guess is organizationally, they could have much higher profits just by trimming the dead weight and actually having knowledgeable people in place. While costing more in salaries it would make or change them significantly in other areas. I know of at least 5 different areas where people who are administrative employees could become cost neutral and even money making positions but because it's not how they've always done things they won't even consider that there might be a better, more cost effective alternative.  Lots of excuses for why things are done the way they are rather than trying to think outside of the box for creative solutions. No communication between operations management and staff. Almost like, they are administration so definitely smarter and above non important you."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "RN staff", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Sept 2018", "job_title": "RN Staff Nurse in Hazard, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nothing good about this company. run.. don't even think of getting a job here. a very toxic environment.  especially with management.", "cons": "vindictive, and punitive. they will go after your license. it is whom you know not what you know. so backward in everything including the way the hospital is managed."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst company I've worked for", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Medical Assistant in Beckley, WV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pretty decent cost of monthly healthcare but only if you use their facilities.
