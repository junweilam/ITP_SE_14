The HR department's rules and regulations as they relate to promotions and salary in addition to our performance evaluations not having any effect on our salary, makes it almost impossible to get ahead. Basically, if you come to work for a particular dept, and you work your fingers to the bone, and get performance reviews that show this, you will still only get the same pay increase as everyone else....usually a paltry 3 percent per year. As to promotions within your group/dept, not so much. There are basically two job categories...IT Analyst and Senior IT Analyst. Unfortunately, the number of Senior IT Analysts is limited to a certain number per group. So, if I were to come into a group already with the allowed number of Senior Analysts, and worked my butt off for 5, 10, 15 years (assuming nobody left), I would never get promoted. Really the only way to get a decent pay raise is to go to another dept, and the increase you receive here is also limited to 10 percent more than what you are making now. This basically prevents any of our lower echelon staff (help desk,etc) from following the natural progression to Desktop Support as the hiring manager cannot pay them what the position is calling for!

A close second is poor communicationswhich is related to the lack of good leadership.\r\n\r\nIn my particular area, the communications from senior leadership and between groups is not good. There is not clear communication about how processes and procedures work to accomplish your work and meet your\r\ngoals. Each team and even members within the team are much too isolated from each other. There is difficulty\r\nin knowing how what others are doing may impact your projects and you may impact them. This makes progress on projects less efficient and often frustrating. This is really a leadership question. Our\r\nleadership from most senior to the middle ranks needs to cultivate an atmosphere where communications\r\ntake priority. This lack of communications also affects the level of service that we give our customers\r\n(and each other) and creates a poor perception (well founded) of the services that we offer throughout \r\nthe rest of the organization. The mechanisms in place for communicating up to senior management are broken\r\nand when attempting to address these broken mechanisms, there is little support or actual attempt to do \r\nanything about it. This creates the feeling that what you are trying to address is unimportant to senior management. That they just don't care enough to fix these avenues of communication that they themselves put in place.  \r\n\r\nAlso decisions are made by managers senior and middle, yet the reasoning behind the decisions is never\r\ncommunicated. This creates bad morale on the part of us workers who actually have to do the work. We are\r\nnot automatons. We are intelligent people who need to be respected for the hard work and skills we \r\nattempt to bring to our jobs. Senior management does not make the effort in communicating and \r\nattempting to build a buy in to the project. It just comes from the top on down and we have to make it \r\nhappen. Why? We just don't know, let alone whether this is a good decision or not. Once again this makes\r\nyou feel like you are unimportant, invisible and senior management just doesn't care. \r\n\r\nSecondly, we are out of balance between delivering new products and features and improving and \r\nstrengthening our existing our offerings and infrastructure. This creates a great deal of stress \r\nfor us workers who have to balance trying to keep current systems going and pushing new systems out. \r\nThis generates bad customer service. Sure, the new features are good but if you can't even log into \r\nthe application to make use of them they serve no one. And they leave the users of our system with frustration and the feeling that we are an incompetent department. This does not make me proud to work here.\r\n\r\nLastly, for now at any rate, there is this unstated expectation on the part of the organization and senior management that we have to put extraordinary hours in to do our work. There is no compensation for the hours you spend outside of the normal workday to support the systems we have and to accomplish what we have been tasked to do.

For example, I worked in a building that had free but unlit parking, which always felt a little sketchy after dark. Duke told us that it would install lighting in the parking lot, but in exchange, it would begin charging us to park in the lot. I suppose this makes good business sense, but it also made it clear that Duke's bottom line was more important than employee safety. It was incumbent upon us to cover our own costs - Duke didn't seem to feel that these kinds of expenses were built into its profit margin.
