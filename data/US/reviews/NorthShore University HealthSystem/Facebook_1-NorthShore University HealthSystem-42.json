When there is an issue a manager fails to respond to there is no successful way to navigate around them and get assistance. Employees are not evaluated by people with direct knowledge of their performance and productive feedback is not a value of the system\u2014it fails to provide critical feedback for professional development. No attention is given to employee retention, even when the employee is excellent and losing them will hurt the team; conversely, poor quality employees are generally let to fester b/c middle management is not competently trained to manage. The system is very responsive to technology issues but ignores employee issues. On the clinical side, nursing and APPs are generally greatly restricted in their practice with almost all decision-making falling to physician staff. In an extremely short-sighted move the system destroyed its social work department in a half completed project and the fallout has echoed through the system and reduced the quality of support that can be offered.

Ultimately, projects would come down the pipeline and lower-level staff would be pulling most of the weight, but wouldn't be pulled into the conversation with senior management, who, many times, were told to be hush hush about projects. In such a small office, that really tends to erode employee morale. \r\n\r\nThe top down model at NorthShore has some cons.
