Upper management can be extremely patronizing to those who work below their pay grade. There is no collaboration or communication between departments which makes even the simplest everyday tasks extremely difficult to carry out.

Many MSH employees at the headquarter office in Medford speak to and about the country offices in the developing countries so condescendingly its uncomfortable. For a company that claims to follow the \"The Tao way of Leadership\" you wouldn't expect such neo-colonial practice, rhetoric, and way of thinking to be so prevalent in the organization.  \r\n\r\nDiscriminatory (part II)- Despite the fact the company works primarily in black and brown countries, the FULL-TIME PERMANENT EMPLOYEES at the headquarter office is almost exclusively white. Inherently this may not be an issue, and of course there can be other variables to account for the disproportionality and underrepresentation of people of color. HOWEVER, you only need half a brain and an ear to hear how some of upper management talks about other ethnicities to realize that the racial makeup of the office is not due to \"coincidence\" but due to discriminatory hiring practices. To cover it up, MSH hires a bunch of black temporary workers so to look as if there are people of color in the office, however after a few months they get rid of them and replace them with white permanent hires. Many of the black temporary workers I have spoken to have told me they interviewed for the same positions they were working in for months, but were told they would not get hired. \r\n\r\nOpportunities for Career Advancement- There're basically are none.

Then the organizational restructuring started, and everything went to hell. The volume of my work tripled or quadrupled (with the same pay because we were conned by HR into thinking it was a lateral move), with a new set of projects that were completely boring. I went from doing professionally fulfilling work under a great manager, to doing tedious work under an incompetent manager.  Also under the new structure, I ended up doing the same work as the folks in the higher employment band but getting paid much less. The inequity of it all was astounding. When I tried to raise my voice about this to HR and Managers, I was either placated by empty promises to change the system or ignored altogether. Trying to get promoted as a minority in the organization proved utterly pointless since I only saw white coworkers get promoted. Imagine, white people running the show for the work done primarily in black and brown countries. MSH has lost or will soon lose every major award that has kept the organization afloat for the last decade or so, but everyone seems to have their heads buried in the sand about this.
