The admissions aren't well planned(getting 6 or 7 at once) and there are often times never enough bodies to go around. Once all the management and ancillary staff go home, nurses and techs have to fend for themselves. Some units are more negative than others and there several employee issues that are never dealt with, especially if they are \"diverse\". Management does their own thing often ignoring common sense suggestions from people doing the patient care. When we balk they all point their finger at each other for blame. No accountability of management. Many patients are too sick still to be getting quality therapy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good Hospital, knowledgeable staff, amazing types of patients, poor work culture and pay,  bad administration", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Patients save the job.
