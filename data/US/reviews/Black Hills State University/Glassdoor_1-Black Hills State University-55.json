Faculty and students are always quite friendly. Small town atmosphere with an easy commute for work. Lovely summer weather and beautiful winter storms. A community feel where everyone knows everyone. Tons and tons of opportunities for outdoor adventures like hiking, biking, swimming, kayaking. Plenty of sports opportunities and lots of church groups to become involved within the town. An absolutely great community to raise a small family with a safe town and lack of crime. Teaching small classes allows one to connect easier and get to know our students. I enjoyed the faculty I worked with though, and the students/classes taught weren't bad. I made good friends and good memories. Facilities on campus are very nice and appealing. Management was good and I enjoyed my co-workers at work. Work/life balance was quite good", "cons": "Bureaucracy. Micro-management. Lack of diversity among faculty and staff. Conservative campus, no outward support for LGBTQ. You are encouraged not to make waves, be nice, and keep your head down. Lack of job security. Lack of forthrightness with students about legitimate prospects for success. No good career programs to help with career opportunities after graduation based on their specific major, they only want your money. Poor Communication between administration departments. Faculty versus administration arguments. (who has a degree vs who doesn\u2019t) Hypocrisy. Favoritism of the technology, business, and education degree programs with more scholarships and connections available. Less support for degrees in humanities and human services. Graduate assistantships and teaching assistantships almost non-existent and only for the tec or science majors. Restrictions on available hours for work-study students. Constant faculty and admin staff turnover. Lots of emphasis on nepotism, in this place it is all about who you know and if they will put in a good word for you, and your experience does not matter. The pay is low for the amount of work you do and in a city, with expensive housing, it means you are just barely surviving. Everything is expensive and tuition keeps increasing every year to the detriment of students. Almost everyone is taking out massive loans to get these degrees and ending up in massive debt of 40k by the end of 4 years. Money gained is used on ridiculous things on campus and not for the betterment of the students. No focus on creating new undergrad or master\u2019s programs to recruit more students. Technology out of date and always glitching.
