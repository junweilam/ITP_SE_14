HR was looped in to help with the harassment and micromanagement from management, but the CIO chose not to act. Unfortunately, there is no hope as IT is under a new weak CIO.

Wonderful facilities. Very affordable tuition, so price is never a determining imposition for students! Furthermore, although it was a lot a large amount, I was afforded my own scholarship money to award every semester to the exceptional students of my choice. Undoubtedly, the greatest perk is the enormous budget available to the faculty, and students. I had a brand new beautiful office. Collin is an all Steinway institution. There is a large student body, which includes a pool of gifted students. Excellent schedule flexibility, excellent summer salary incentive, pension, sick pool, great [although gravely overworked) administrative assistants in the division offices, excellent faculty development support with generous travel budget. Price was simply NEVER an issue. (I had one $$ issue in all my years. In reality, it was just an ugly surprise, compliments of a vindictive dean.) The students are given a daily food stipend when traveling. Furthermore, we flew to our annual competitions, and stayed in the best hotels available. I was always afforded a private hotel room. (Wonderful!) .We rented an SUV upon arrival. Travel was always first class for the students, and faculty, which is truly a joy. The students never had to worry about the cost of travel. Nor did they have or try to save money that they didn\u2019t have in order to participate. It was always free for all! Additionally, there is a completely separate financial resource available to the students through the student activities fund. Every student pays a $100 activity fee per semester into the activity fund. Quickly do the math. (53,000 students X $100 = $5,300,000) pouring into the student activity fund every semester! WOW! All for the asking. That\u2019s incredible. Although the music department was under funded, I had a generous music literature budget each semester. It only took a few years to fill my file cabinet\u2019s with the finest score\u2019s available. Every piece I desired was at my fingertips. If I didn\u2019t have it, I telephoned our music source, and charged my open PO. In retrospect, I never concerned myself with going over budget. The division secretaries, transferred more money into the PO, as needed. Although I had to share a studio space for applied lessons, it worked out well enough. Our studio was nice, although one never saw the sun on those days when lessons ruled the roost. The students, and I were afforded an incredible collaborative pianist in every lesson. She additionally went with me to every class. And, she traveled to competitions, etc. During my tenure, I designed, and taught 25 courses. ( Nice variety.) I had complete academic freedom, although I sometimes had to fight for it. Collin has an excellent curriculum advisory board. They are willing to accommodate the faculty with the approval of new, inventive, quality courses. I was fortunate over several years to have the opportunity to build my program. In doing so, I created the need for a full-time professorship. Voila! (That was not easy, mind you. And, doesn\u2019t happen often.) Because I was the only full-time voice professor, I auditioned each incoming voice student, and placed them in the appropriate level of study, with the faculty member I felt best suited for the student. After a few years, my student\u2019s auditioned a semester early to secure a space in my studio. I additionally made hiring decisions for our associate vocal faculty, which was a treat. I think we were likely the only voice faculty in the country who actually enjoyed being together. I afforded the associate faculty complete academic freedom, and independence. I never attempted to require a percentage of my opinion as a determining factor for a student\u2019s grade. My jury comments were just that. Comments. There are retirement options available for the teachers retirement system of Texas, or a Texas money market fund. When I started, the medical benefits were excellent; however, they deteriorated over the years. Obviously, I enjoyed much of my time there. It was a fulfilling job. I felt honored to have the opportunity. Colin afford me the freedom to pursue academic, and creative excellence.", "cons": "As is the norm for academia, everything depends on one\u2019s Dean, and upper administration. When I started, I had an excellent Dean, who was impressed with my work, and supportive of my program. Unfortunately, that changed. Although there were several exceptions on the crux of the full time music faculty was mediocre, at best. They were petty and childish. That should not have been a surprise, given the typical dynamics of a music program; however, it was exhausting, and absolutely unnecessary! The problematic individuals didn\u2019t have the ethics required amongst the sum of them to fill half of a shaker of salt. Games, evil plotting p, and the calculatedly schemes of jealousy were common place. It was a common place for them to completely sabotage, an innocent students, GPA, and dreams of a music career, just to serve their selfish, current, boring agenda. Dullards! That I found quite irritating. Total unnecessary drama. Heavens! It was always watching for the next boot to fall. (Humpty Dumpty drama!) if I have half the effort into teaching that they did into manipulation, they may have been adequate? Yet, they were not. Inbreeds from the music school in the next town. My days would be limited.

It was 2 weeks before someone told me I should be clocking in and out daily, and the person that told me was NOT my supervisor. I had to throw a literal fit to get an advising handbook.\r\n\r\n- Leadership does not understand how to lead. The team has many suggestions for how things could be changed - like the student queue not being closed until 5pm. That doesn't make things fair for the advisors nor does it teach students accountability of going somewhere during the regular hours AND before they close! The college clearly only cares about enrollment numbers and not the advisors doing the enrollment. When these concerns and feedback are brought up by staff, they are ignored. I was told trying to get your concerns heard from anybody above our supervisors was like \"beating a dead horse\". \r\n\r\n- Messaging is trash from leadership. Chunky emails scolding employees saying \"we need to be better\" for missing a student that needed advising AFTER 5PM, but 20 mins later it's an email about ice cream in the breakroom since we \"work so hard\". Lots of micromanaging, even from the part-time advisors? So weird. Be prepared to not be trusted by the supervisors enough to even work remotely to do \"College Day\" which was 30 mins of videos on Youtube. We had to come onto the closed campuses for 2 hours to do that nonsense. \r\n\r\nOverall, I've never been in a more unorganized, discouraging environment.
