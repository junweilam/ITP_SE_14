Even sometimes working harder than BPs and was not rewarded for that. You will be written up if you get sick, even if it is COVID, or the flu. Even if you're in the hospital and provide proof, HR will still write you up. This also affects your hiring bonus, which nobody told any of the employees. So many people quit under a year, there is so much staff turnover. Management and HR have horrible absence policies, emergency weather policies, etc. They took PTO hours from employees even when the whole clinic was closed due to snow and there was no work. Full time workers do not get sick days, it must come from your PTO if you've accrued it, otherwise it's a tally against you and that's only the first 40 hours. Working with kids so many people got sick and were afraid to miss work which puts children at risk so they'd come to work so ill. You only get a 30 minute lunch break and they don't give you time to go to the bathroom throughout the day, you just have to ask someone to watch your kid for you and sometimes that's impossible. Many times treatment plans are not updated so it makes it hard to do documentation. Definitely experienced behaviors from clients which was hard but they do tell you about that in the interview, so yeah. Made really good friends, but suffered everyday and was overworked overwhelmed and underpaid."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Too Little Too Late", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Revenue Cycle Coordinator III-Team Lead in Bloomington, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Generous PTO -team oriented mentality -working from home leads to flexibility -mission based organization", "cons": "-Poor management -Poor pay even though they boast good pay -incompetent departments make more work for other departments -Continuously unloading more and more work without additional benefits -constant staff changes"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 May 2023", "job_title": "Case Manager in Fargo, ND", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice employer, good pay, nice ppl", "cons": "Bad leadership, no cafeteria, no paid leave"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to learn as a new clinician", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 May 2023", "job_title": "Speech Language Pathologist in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-team environment -caring, compassionate staff -wonderful children and families", "cons": "-productivity requirements -low pay -overscheduled clinicians"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great flexibility and supportive management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Mental Health Technician in Woodbury, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supportive management and flexible schedule", "cons": "Working full time can cause burnout quickly, no individual pay raises"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good entry level position", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Client Services Coordinator in Richfield, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provided training on insurance plan, and utilizing electronic health record systems.", "cons": "Pay is low and work load is high."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great people, okay pay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional (DSP) in Saint Paul, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, training, work environment, staff", "cons": "The pay is not good"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good experience, little to no upward mobility", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Mental Health Practitioner in Minneapolis, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- A great opportunity to work with kids in a behavioral treatment setting -

These are the employees typically working directly with clients in group homes or in the Fraser School. It is my opinion that they deserve to be compensated at a higher level for the hard work they are doing. The board of directors is comprised of donors who have contributed large sums rather than representative of the community that Fraser is serving. Overall, this moves the focus to the donors and what Fraser can do to earn more money instead of focusing on what can be done to benefit the community and the clients we serve. Recently, a number of reviews were posted from people in management, HR, and employees who have been with Fraser for a number of years. I feel that this is skewing the rating given that many of these ratings were posted within the last few weeks and the rating was then added to the Fraser website.
