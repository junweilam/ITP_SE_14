The situation at Bastyr has become progressively worse over the last year with Dr. Powell's presidency and actions from the board.  The last few years had been rough to start with - there are a number of managers and higher level employees who have been with the University for more than 15 years, and are resistant to change and completely out of touch with the realities of higher education this century.

If you're lucky enough to get offered a role on one of those teams, I'd encourage you to consider it but do so very carefully.  The culture is toxic right now, benefits and pay are poor, and there is no opportunity for professional development or advancement.

The other reviews posted are accurate - the culture has become toxic, and employees being ignored is frankly a best case scenario.  More commonly, those who speak up are bullied into silence by management, the board, and even human resources.  There is a facade of caring through an \"open door\" policy and community town hall events, but nothing comes of them, and they seem better at instilling more fear into the community than anything else.  As I mentioned before, benefits are terrible.  There is little respect for work/life balance, and it is an incredibly difficult environment for anyone with a family.  They don't provide any paid parental leave - a perfect example of them not practicing what they preach.  Some admin positions make a decent salary, but that's about it.  \r\n\r\nBastyr is significantly behind the times from a technology standpoint, and refuses to invest in any sort of infrastructure to support the growth they're demanding.  The human resources department and VP are the worst I've ever seen in an organization this size, and they have freely admitted to me that they do not believe it's their responsibility to be sensitive to employees' needs.

He eliminated vacant positions that were not only necessary to the university on the whole, but were necessary to executing his initiatives.\r\n\r\nHe also made vague statements about what he wanted to see, but never when he wanted to see them or what strategy he was following in asking for them.  After six months, he began forcing people out because they could not meet his vague demands that had no timeline.  He did it by making the jobs harder than they should have been.  He did it by guaranteeing a certain amount of time to execute his goals, and then changing the deadline suddenly.  He did it by asking for people\u2019s resignations.  He did all of this so that he could stand behind the statement that he never had, and never would, fire anybody.\r\n\r\nAnd after he forced people out, he began micromanaging key departments with the assistance of his Chief of Staff.  Mine and my team\u2019s input no longer mattered.  We no longer assisted in steering the university\u2019s mission.  Our responsibilities were being farmed out to freelancers without our knowledge.  Projects showed up half formed with no strategy and we were given no time to clean them up.  We executed vague plans with large price tags.  We executed projects that we knew would fail.

This is impacting health and wellbeing, but the administration, and president, fail to understand this. One proposal (just a discussion point at this stage) for balancing the budget is for faculty to voluntarily donate a percentage of their pay back to the student scholarship fund (a very lofty and nobel request), however, we have not heard what concessions the administration are willing to make. This is the first time Bastyr is paying for the president's house and car, which might be one budget cut possible. Often the response is something about how \"this is a standard practice in academia, yet supposedly we are in financial straights now. This may only amount to a small portion of the budget, but it would be a) a gesture and b) something. \r\n\r\nThe president says he has an open door policy, which is intriguing, since he fails to demonstrate listening skills.
