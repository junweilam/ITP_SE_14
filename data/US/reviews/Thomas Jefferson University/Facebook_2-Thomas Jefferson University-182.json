Once when I visited the HR office in person to get help for the problem, the woman standing right in front of me and talking to me would do nothing for me. She told me the only help I could get was on the HR web site. Another debacle is their public transport discount, about 10 percent off for one of the monthly passes offered by area public transit. They send the passes out in the U.S. mail, which is unreliable. If your pass (which can be expensive) is lost in the mail, they won't issue you another one. You're left paying double for a month's travel, penalized for participating in a program that's meant to save us money. This has happened to me. As a part-time employee on a tight budget, neither the challenge of finding my income and tax info nor double the cost of transportation is affordable for me.
