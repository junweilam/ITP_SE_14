I would ask how I could improve or why I could not get any more of a raise and I was always simply told I needed to do more. I needed to work on more high-profile projects. Eventually, I did come up with a very high-profile, value-add project and then was told I would not be given the tools or training to complete. So of course, when it came time for evaluations, I was once again told to do more and cited my lack of project completion as why I would not be getting more of a raise.\n\nLeadership was also seriously lacking, no direction was ever given and no processes were ever documented or put in place. If you asked any leaders what the protocol for something was, they would be very vague and nebulous. And if something happened, fingers were always pointed but no processes would be put in place to mitigate future occurrences. Same with all projects, I had asked many times for feedback and direction as well as my peers and the only feedback ever given were random word misspellings or incorrect font usage on the presentations.\n\nMost infuriating of it all was that I was told I could never email any director-level internal employees or higher unless my own director had proof-read them. I had worked in many companies and this is the most bizarre and ludicrous rule I've ever come across. \n\nThe director here leads by fear and is of the mentality that you're lucky you even have a job. By telling us that we are not that great at our jobs and therefore not worthy of raises and making us believe it, is simply fear-mongering. We are not given any support at all. When we meet with leadership on blockers for projects or initiatives we are simply told to 'do better'.
