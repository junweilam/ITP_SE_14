That culture rewards political favors, unnecessary and counterproductive \"consensus building\" which can stretch what should be a 6 month project to several years, and does not pay prevailing wages. \r\n\r\nExample: In a corporate environment, what should take a day or two in terms of an email response to a query could take a week or more at NYU. That is, unfortunately, the de facto response and the culture of sluggishness that exists in NYU and almost all higher education institutions.\r\n\r\n6) On the latter point, NYU does offer very generous Tuition Remission and Retirement matching benefits (though they have been skimping on the tuition remission component in recent years). However, if you are not interested in attaining more education or are not in need of turbo-charging your retirement accounts, NYU will likely drive you batty.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these elements in combination lead to \"older\" employees who are looking to hold on as long as possible to get themselves to retirement, or get their children through school, and very \"young\" employees who are merely trying to get through school and get out as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nMany of the remaining people in between fall into a category of being \"unhireable\" anywhere outside of the higher education environment.\r\n\r\n7) Another NYU failing, and likely higher education in general, falls to the apportionment of funds for various departments. \r\n\r\nEx: NYU will spend millions on its faculty on such frivolous items as underwriting mortgages with *very* generous benefits for deans, loans for cars and other non-education related expenses for professors, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, they will cut headcount for critical services such as IT, Security, etc. Or cut services that help offset recruitment issue woes such as Tuition Remission.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this failure is the use of high-priced consultants instead of hiring competent employees at prevailing wages.\r\n\r\nRather than hire an extra 2-3 employees to support critical systems, an expenditure which might cost NYU $200,000-$300,000/yr at prevailing wages and benefits, NYU will pay consultants $1,000,000 for the same work, year after year.\r\n\r\nThis is because those consultants are part of a different budget than is counted for full time headcount. This ensures that the ultimate bearers of those costs, the parents and students, will continue to see their tuition rise unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThese and many other issues make NYU, and many higher education institutions, highly inefficient and ineffective, yet obscenely expensive, places to work and finance.\r\n\r\nNYU could do much, much, better."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "The perfect place for student on campus emplyment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Mar 2014", "job_title": "Web Publishing Student Consultant in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is very respectful and diversified.
