The death of any institution comes when reputation building exceeds growth mindsets. Reputation builders are not looking to lift some boats in the harbor but rather work to be seen as the most important boat in the pond. Reputation builders prioritize how others perceive their looks so much they are willing to compromise the whole institution in their quest for perfection. All resources are leveraged to keep new ideas and growing pains of the crew from \"rocking the boat.\" All means are used to keep the exterior paint from forming any blemish, blemishes created by dinging other boats in the harbor into the pier, or even the use of the boat itself (open dialogue, being disagreeable, or constructive criticism). Meanwhile, the timber and planks of the boat are rotting, the underside of the vessel below the water line is laboring under the weight of barnacles, and the condition of the thwart is bad enough it begins to scare off customers from entering the sinking boat. Downward it moves until the weight of the water collapses the pristinely painted walls under the slightest wave or impact with other vessels. Reputation builders see through the filter of 'zero-sum' value: if an idea or proposal isn't theirs, their value is diminished somehow. If subordinates exhibit needed growth or imperfection, this reflects poorly on them, and they must eliminate it. When good people are quiet in their duties. When money is diverted to work, that maximizes goodwill among department heads and leadership rather than repairing decaying infrastructure or constructive innovation. When the smell of spirits twists within the breath of pandering masters. When departments form into insular tribes, and blame is cast instead of enthusiasm to find a solution, reputation builders are commanding the ship. Be advised to find another ship. Find a vessel that bears the marks of good use and of a happy and diverse crew that greats happy guests. This institution leaves its customers with smiles and joyfully maintains and improves the ship from the rudder to the bow after departing on exciting and, at times, risky adventures."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Place to Work, but Not a Fan of Muncie", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "21 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Director in Muncie, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I really like the leadership, and the university has a great culture.
