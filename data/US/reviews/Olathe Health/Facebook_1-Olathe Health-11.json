We grew the department by 30% despite the pandemic and only one staff member turned over. We were able to carry out our duties to the point of having a deficiency free survey once the worst of the pandemic was over.\n\nWe survived as a mostly intact team through 5 transitions at the director level. In January of 2022 they allowed the home health supervisor to step into the role of director over Hospice/Hospice House/Home Health. Her background and focus was all profit all the time. This wasn't entirely her fault as the directives originated with the VP of nursing but unlike her predecessors in the director role, she had no interest in standing up for the staff or the patients. This is probably why we went through so many...\n\nIn April of 2022 they decided to increase the expected number of visits a day for a home hospice nurse from 3-5 to 7 or 8. This is completely impractical and unsafe based on the nature of the hospice goals of care. This was addressed with management and staff was actively told to \"shut up and do as you are told\" because the expectation was not going to change. \n\nUnfortunately the director had no experience in hospice and tried to make it run exactly like home health and had no interest in learning about hospice beyond lecturing staff about how to make things \"more profitable\". \n\nThese are people's family members and they are going through one of the hardest experience many of them have ever faced and they are being told they can't have all the supplies, visits or support they need to get through it because of lack of staffing. They are facing having visits cut to the bone, inexperienced staff, and staff with a lower level licensure being sent instead of RN's. They went from one supervisor who also worked in the field, and four trained RNs who had been in the field ranging from 1 year to 15 years and over the last 4 months they have gone down to one Hospice house supervisor and two very inexperienced hospice RN's and a few LPN's who are doing the majority of the work. \n\nThe Director who allowed this to happen, and who actively forced out the experienced staff is still there and has been allowed to bully, berate, and terrorize her staff to the point of multiple HR complaints being filed that the main HR staff won't do anything about. She retaliates against anyone who speaks out against her and actively gets out any staff member who isn't one of her sycophants.\n\n If you are looking to get into hospice, I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone apply here. I have been in the industry since 2009 and have never had a situation quite this bad.

Interactions with patients also tend to lighten the day.", "cons": "Due to the departure of a well-respected and well-liked member of the hospital's leadership team, a number of responsibilities have been dispersed to other senior managers. This has created a situation in which at least a few of the individuals who've stepped up to take on new tasks can no longer effectively oversee the original departments they were leading. Naturally, many of these managers are finding it hard to let go of what they were successful at in the first place (especially after learning they know next to nothing about their new responsibilities and encountering failure.) These managers also -- again, naturally -- have a tendency to be overly protective of the job duties they now have to hand over to someone else. In turn, they put far too much pressure on their teams.\r\n\r\nBe expected to start from scratch. Despite being hired onto a long-established team, you may quickly find that the departmental processes they have in place are antiquated (even for a hospital.) This organization really wants to be forward thinking and creative with some of its teams, but unfortunately the senior leadership does not support this mentality. When management says they are open to new ideas, that is not necessarily the case. In fact, be prepared to revert back to the old method of doing things.\r\n\r\nA number of employees shared with me management's tendency to micro-manage. I found this to be true quickly, and it only got worse from there. From project status and responding to phone calls, to what you wear and the preparation of outlines for every meeting (even the shortest conversations), this organization concentrates on the minutiae. I was often subject to \"pop quizzes\" about aspects of the hospital organization that were only loosely related to my job at the moment. I was also part of many odd conversations in which my boss questioned my personal integrity because of the frequency with which I checked my voicemail. Bottom line: Employees are not trusted, no matter what your resume says. It may take you several years before you can earn anything close to respect from your direct manager.\r\n\r\nThe last \"con\" I will share is that the job that was presented to me was not what I found when I began work. I joined a department that faced an enormous workload, and despite helping that team get out from under this burden, management found a way to change expectations for my role and ultimately be dissatisfied with my performance."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Finance Department", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Finance Department in Olathe, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employees want to do their jobs well.
