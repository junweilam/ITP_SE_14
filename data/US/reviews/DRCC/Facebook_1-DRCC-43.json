I'm sure it's easy to forget the little guy when you're on top. Lead by example by putting the individuals that we serve first, show us, remind us that they come first.

They are understaffed and overworked, the staffing is unsafe at times. Even if you think you're doing a great job at work the management will tell you that you're doing a bad job. There's hours of yearly training to do online yet almost no hands-on training within the program, they throw you right into it and then reprimand you when you're doing something incorrectly instead of trying to help you learn. They will not make any accomodations for you as a person in terms of your schedule or things you aren't able to do due to physical or mental health. Gossip, favoritism and nepotism at its finest.
