Senior management talks out of both sides of their face- can't be trusted. They are a business not a hospital. They don't care about their employees. Make them work short and tell the media they are full staffed. Not true. For every person they hire 1 to 2 leave. Plus, it takes awhile for that person to be trained. They are focus on untrained nurses giving them bonuses but do nothing for the experienced nurses that are there with the knowledge to train them. So they leave, and only barely trained nurses are there for an entire floor. It is unsafe. Patient care has greatly suffered. I do the best that I can, but I know I no longer can give the best care that I once gave because the workload is just too great. I'm waiting on my turn to leave.
