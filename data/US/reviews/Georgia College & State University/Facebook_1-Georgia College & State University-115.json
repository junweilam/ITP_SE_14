But it all depends on your department. My department was great fun to work with and very flexible. Pay is good when you consider cost of living in Baldwin County. For example, 46,000 here would equate to roughly 76,000 in Metro Atlanta. Benefits are good including health, dental, vision, TRS (401k / pension plan), AD&D, and much more. The best benefit by far is the Tuition Assistance Program or TAP. This allows any full-time employee who has worked more than 6 months at the institution to take college courses for free. GC is a smaller campus, so if you're willing to learn new things and help others, you'll find the entire campus faculty and staff are happy to teach you.", "cons": "Hiring from within isn't terribly common, so the position you are hired for is often the one you are stuck with. This isn't the private sector, so yearly raises or cost of living adjustments aren't common either. The hours can be a little weird including late nights and weekends, but that comes with the territory of working in video and for a university. Undergrad students don't work on an 8-5 schedule after all. Also public sector jobs are NOT for the impatient. Hiring can take months, so be warned and patient.
