Regardless of all our extra stress we were not given any extra compensation or help at all. I don't necessarily think this was intentional?? Maybe we just kind of got forgotten in all the chaos? Obviously the hospital clinical staff was under the most stress and hardship. I don't downplay that. However, we have been understaffed and overcome with more children to care for while the parents of children in our state received free childcare for almost 2 years. A little more help with more staff or better wage increases as companies across the globe are paying employees more per hour would've been greatly appreciated. We received nothing of the sort. And as prices for everything increase daily we are left with the same little .25-.40 cent raise as always. Barely enough to cover the cost of our company insurance that increases most every year. We're working ourselves ragged and the cost of living keeps sky rocketing and financially its a strain when you're not compensated and raised up like other workers.\r\nI realize that I sound negative and I don't mean to be. I do appreciate what the company does and it is not a horrible place to work. As stated above I am thankful that my company pays better for my job position than many many others.

Some groups are allowed 1 day a week, while others only 2 days a month. Other groups within CHI can work remotely up to 2-3 days a week. In addition, this is so micromanaged is ridiculous! VP micromanages his direct reports and has instructed them to monitor everyone so we cannot have the same work from home day every week, even if one day works better than others. What happened to treating people like adults? If you don't trust your management/staff - get rid of them and replace them with people you do trust. Let them do their jobs and manage the organization and projects, rather than worrying about who is working from home when. The most interesting thing is that the EPMO hires people that don't work anywhere near a CHI facility - they work from home 100% of the time.  We have also had full-time resources that lived in CO move out of state and are permitted to work from home 100% of the time. Double standards across the board! \r\n\r\nManagement of company resources:\r\nThe company has lost a ton of money, the IT resources and dollars have been poorly allocated and managed and yet we continue to acquire more space for employees. BRILLIANT IDEA ALERT - move to a cube share and quit acquiring space. This is not rocket science! Be responsible, move into the 21st century and build tools that allow you to better manage your resources so you can let go of the fear of telecommuting. Quit hiring expensive firms to come in and tell you how to do things. You can take that money and better invest elsewhere. Hold more ALL company meetings to learn what is happening in the MBOs so that we quit doing duplicate work.  HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE! I know of plenty of dead-weight, we are paying good money to people who accomplish nothing, do not follow-up and manage their projects or complete their tasks.\r\n\r\nProcess and templates\r\nSome process and templates are helpful. What CHI has is overkill. The PM's do not have the ability to manage their projects as needed - we have to use this template, that template and they have also required us to use an interface between MS Project and Clarity (the PMIS) and it doens't work and you have to take a two hour class just to figure out how to use it - why not just let us manage our projects! We spend more time in training and then taking refresher training and going to meetings that we cannot effectively manage our projects."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Struggling with Retention", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Federal Way, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Diversity is strong and work culture is great among my fellow team of nurses, at least in the specific area that I work in.

I think this is the case for most facilities. I think they handled this in the best way they could, but nurse staffing shortages were common. Year after year there seemed to be more turn overs, even with newer nurses that had completed their residencies. Most of the time this was because they sought higher education or similar opportunities. More experienced nurses (5 plus years of experience in some cases) would leave for better benefits and pay, which is not very competitive for the area, especially compared to the rise in the Seattle market. There is rarely incentive to stay- there are no bonuses and no benefits to being a long term employee (except that you get a better set schedule, which was the case for me). St. Francis is considered a stepping stone for most incoming nurses who are coming in as new-grads seeking a residency.  I'm not sure if this is something new or not, but I feel that recognition, retention, and overall appreciation for employees has fallen to one of the bottom-most priorities. I think this definitely harming morale and creating negative  feelings towards management. I think that supporting experienced staff members should actually be a priority, especially in how high the acuity has grown for this particular facility. It would make sense that they would funnel a little more resources into supporting their nurses if they have active plans to grow (which CHI has demonstrated with its mergers and expansion plans, which includes St. Francis as well)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great opportunities in the past, but lots of changes, especially in IT", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Sept 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Omaha, NE", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There used to be a lot of great people, and the managers were great about letting people cross-train and learn new disciplines.

If one employee is having a problem following rules, whether the reason is forgetfulness, a lack of caring, or a lack of information; rather than discussing it with the employee, the department director is likely to mention the problem at a staff meeting and \"remind\" the entire department that it is important to follow that particular rule or procedure. The individual employee with the problem may not even realize that s/he is the one who precipitated the reminder. In similar situations, the department manager may speak privately to the employee, but if there is no improvement, there are often no consequences. This is not a consistent problem, but does happen sometimes in some departments.\r\n\r\nTraining for department leaders is not thorough, so some leaders have trouble being effective.

While interviewing for a vendor I was almost not considered for the position because CHI was on my resume.  Upon further review they said they felt better that I was only there a short time which means I'm not crazy (this coming from an executive at a vendor in which CHI is a top client).\r\n\r\nPromise all the advancement opportunities in the world and unlimited salary to find it was all hypothetical.\r\n\r\nThe hiring process was the most stressful and drawn own.  First phone interview (of four lasting an hour each) began at the end of September; after two video conference interviews I was later offered employent in December.\r\n\r\nThe organization uses HireRight as their background check company (check the review for that company, many complaints with the better business bureau).  The background check took 4 weeks and they called and emailed me daily asking for prove of everything.  They had the audacity to ask for my first paycheck from my employer from 2003...\r\n\r\nMy first day orientation had me meeting the HR representative I worked with, walking around my building looking at a map trying to find my cube number, and then being placed at an empty desk.

There's no work/life balance and you can easily find better tax job opportunities in Denver that pay more money and the office environment is much better than Catholic.
