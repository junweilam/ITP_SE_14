If they have vibes of not liking you/ your personality, they will show it by not helping you as much when you ask for it and talking behind your back. This pushed me switch to night shift. . Not every part of the hospital is like that. I quickly learned that you are replaceable, ALWAYS replaceable. Always put your personal health and well-being FIRST.

Now for my review\r\nPOOR COMPENSATION: Below average pay for the level of responsibility that is required of patient registration specialist; CAREER OPPORTUNITIES: Opportunities are dependent upon who you know and if your own manager likes you or not regardless of how qualified you are - so if you want to grow or move into other departments - keep your opinions to yourself and suck up to your manager - sucking up or brown nosing is not my style because I prefer to be authentic and genuine and is why I was never successful at moving into other departments and I was certainly qualified for the positions in which I was applying. POOR LEADERSHIP: Incredibly poor management for such a large corporation, they lack the ability to inspire and motivate staff, management is close-minded & unwilling to listen to staff's input on improvement processes or ideas, which makes no sense (since) employees are the ones that do the work & can determine what processes could work more efficiently (senseless duplication of work - wasteful spending), poor management is probably one of the single biggest reason for the high turnover rates - just look at the number of open positions listed on any job site - this should be the first and most obvious clue that their is a problem - In all fairness - this can vary in every department but is still a common issue in my experience; FAVORITISM: I suppose this can happen in any job but it was blatantly obvious within the department I worked in and made the daily processes very difficult - our manager was bipolar and everyone's day depended on her mood - she was particular close to a handful of employees that were chronically late, lazy, and constantly MIA leaving work stations unattended and when reported to leadership - nothing happened and things did not change - except for the person that reported the issue - use your imagination."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not happy", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Research Specialist in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "6 weeks PTO from the beginning.

Very few people stay more than 5 years because there is better pay at other hospitals less than 50 miles away.  The culture that management creates is that  of a ship of rats that will eat each other in order to think they are getting ahead. But the reality is that they don't care about anyone.  I saw them intentionally target employees bc they had been there too long and it cost less to hire new staff than to pay the experienced ones.  They preach patient care but ask yourself this do you want a brand new fresh from school nurse taking care of your family member or one that has been working as a nurse for 20 years. In a hospital it is the experience of the nursing staff that ensures you or your family member make it home, and not the doctor. \r\n          The starting pay for a nurse has not changed in 10 years because there is no real hospital close enough to compete for market share.  Staff that would come in and work overtime every time the phone rings to support their families are not appreciated at all for the extra effort in fact it is the opposite. They look for any reason to impose disciplinary \"points\" so that you are unable to transfer to another part of the hospital.  They also use these \"points\" to build a paper trail of \"problems\" so that when they fire you they can say they had a reason and not pay for unemployment. And even those don't matter if they want you gone because you won't drink the kool-aid and be a \"company man\".  One Nurse I worked with had never been disciplined in 5 years but when she disagreed with the nursing managers policy of mandatory overtime because they had gone through the annual thinning of the staff cycle. She was fired for NOT REPORTING SOMETHING SHE DID NOT SEE HAPPEN, because she knew the story was a flat out lie told by one person to help get rid of another. \r\n     This sorry excuse for a hospital is more like a highschool where dumb kids that suck up to the teacher get promoted into management because they are willing to lie and say what management wants to hear when the patient satisfaction scores come back low.  The lack of accountability for individual performance is unreal, and the only way to get ahead is to be a backstabbing liar.  \r\n     They have recently frozen peoples retirement plans and will not allow any further contributions to them nor the transfer out of your money to another qualified plan. Apparently they have struck a deal with another retirement provider.  How is that ok?????\r\n       The only way I worked there for 20 years was by staying on night shift and transferring from one department to another at a minimum of every 5 years.  But even then once they wanted me to leave their was no choice I just had to start looking for a new employer before they found a reason to fire me and then take my pension. If you work here you really need to be able to know when someone you don't see or talk to has decided you have been there too long.. They will normally find someone that has no dignity to lie and help them get rid of you.

But if you have a child or children, it is next to impossible to not miss work on occasion.

If we are swamped and short they can not be found...They have no trouble however pointing out that the \"hourly rounding sheet is not initialed\"  I believe this company may be a sinking ship. They developed more and more and bought up other hospitals..But they did not focus on their core or their employees.  We went into this field to nurse and yet there seems to be a pull to leave the bedside and more younger nurses are encouraged to \"manage\" or do \"charge\" before they are even equipped with the skills to do so which leads to many of the workers feelings unappreciated and overworked by staffing set from a \"green\" newer nurse that sees a budget tool and not the real picture.

For example, secretaries were let go; not just secretaries to administrators, but secretaries that answer patient call lights, that answer the telephones when patient family is calling or when an MD needs to contact the nurse.  Next, environmental services were affected.  It's nothing to see linen bags overflowing and trash overflowing.  The number of aids(Techs, Student Nurses, PSAs, PCAs) to nurses were cut.  As a bedside nurse I don't mind ansering the telephone, the call light, emptying the trash and linens, but at what expense?  At the expense of  care to the patient!  For example, if a patient receives an  \"unplanned\" wound(bed sore) during his/her stay, the hospital isn't reimbursed for the cost of caring for that wound and rightfully so.  BUT, when I need help to turn and re-position my patient to prevent pressure ulcers and there is no help available.....With all of these cuts the same amount of work is expected of nursing and everyone else....NO!  Let me re-phrase that!  More work is expected out of everyone.  I am expected to answer the phone, answer call lights in a \"timely\" manner, empty trash, empty linens, all while caring for my critical patients and providng the best care to induce the best outcomes."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Upper Management doesn't care about its safety for RN's or Patients", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Administrative in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You do get really good pay.", "cons": "Management has no training skills, The hiring process is ridiculous with turn around, Don't be fooled by IU Health North high end decor the management is just as bad if not worse than downtown.

The requirements for employees especially RN's to be on the floor even when they are ill is unsafe. North hospital alone has so many HIPPA violations with their scheduling office. To fire the AA's and have non-clinical clerical people to staff the hospital is very stupid. Management has no regard for family life for hourly associates and RN's. Management at North is quick to pass the buck and fire good workers to save their butts. Lastly if your a person who asks questions to learn your job or request additional training, or you have a disability and need accommodations IU Health is not a place you want to work. Your expected to accept subpar training for 2 to max 6 weeks, put on a Unit and know your job with no errors. God forbid if you question the training cause you will be on their sh.... list. So if you can take the money and handle the unsafe work environment, lack of training and can go without asking questions its the perfect place to work.
