So many employees have only worked there, or have worked there for so long that it's all they know, and because of this are very resistant to change and updating practices, especially within HR. Systems and practices used at OHSU are very out of date and there are very limited up-to-date written procedures. The new CPO is initiating change that is much needed, but so many managers are resistant and are giving so much pushback to this change because it goes against their outdated practices. Aside from the overall change needed, I personally had an awful experience within the mission that I worked in. I was there for months and never received any formal training on procedures or any tasks that I would be taking on. I was constantly disregarded by my manager after asking for more training and asking for feedback about how I can be successful. I had to navigate so much of my job on my own and just hope for the best. Time and time again I also was shown that faculty is above all and get what they want. This was easily one of the worst jobs I've ever had and was so disappointing.

Every day I am grateful, even with a paycut, for the improvement in my qualify of life working here vs other local health systems and health plans. OHSU has a collaborative, curious culture that promotes transparency. I think much of that comes from being a part of an academic medical center that leads research.... it bleeds into all areas of the organization, which is a great thing. It feels good to be providing services that are not available other places and to be developing new things.

On top of all this, OHSU pays their research staff less equitably than the national average.

The people who were celebrated picked up a ton of shifts so most (with one significant exception in my mind) of them were overworked and cranky. I saw nurses snap at patients multiple times. Staff talked smack about and made fun of patients in the break room. Routinely called security just to intimidate patients over minor rule violations-not trauma informed at all! I would have hoped that Black Lives Matter would inspire Unity to be less \u201ccop-y\u201d but no luck. \u201cShow of force\u201d bs. The security staff are pretty cool and they wear street clothes but patients are very reactive to them because they do still give off law enforcement vibes and many if not most of the patients have trauma from police. \r\n-constant, constant power struggles with patients over many rules; this might be normal in psych but I\u2019m trying to create a review that would be useful for nurses from other fields considering working here.\r\n-just not a great place for patients to stay which is depressing to work in because you have so little to offer them in the way of comfort or therapy-no quality recreation in a harsh and rigid rule based environment. \r\n-too much floating they put me on the high acuity floor against my protests after only being there five months. They float without rhyme or reason; you should be with the same patients as much as possible. If you\u2019re trying to be patient centered, as they claimed incessantly.\r\n-some of the nurses they brought in to cover shifts were not well trained or oriented at all.\r\n-the staff just complained constantly even though they had the best working conditions I\u2019ve ever been in. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t advance workers rights, always push for the workers\u2019 conditions to improve!- but the negativity of the staff was not warranted. Nursing in general sucks and sucks even more during the pandemic but at least on my unit it was a culture of bonding through complaining.\r\n-scheduling is confusing and all over the place. Different week to week, it\u2019s nice because you can sort of pick your shifts (I\u2019d say preferences in my case were respected 90% of the time) but you do this well in advance, up to 2 months and at least no one in my life, including me plans that far ahead.

For clerical positions represented by the union, OHSu pays most of the cost of insurance premiums for the employee. They will on pay part of the cost for a spouse and, if you work part-time, they pro-rate the cost of the benefits so you will pay more while earning less. Also, the union (AFSCME) seems to do little in the way of actually improving conditions for employees. If you run into trouble and want their help, you have to pay an additional fee to be a 'fair share member.' Otherwise, they won't return your calls.\r\nOHSU lays off staff regularly 'in anticipation' of budget shortfalls. I've been laid of twice since I started there.\r\nIn general, leadership does not want a clerical union. Physicians and researchers do not want to hire sufficient staff to complete the workload in their functional areas.

Management especially promises one thing to you and you even see it on paper, but some how along the line you can tell that you are being lied, spat at and coerced to the point of having no hope by what they say anymore. (E.g. offered a new job position or promotion, it is never guaranteed even when upper high management tells you and you agree and accept the new offer). Lack of females working, male dominated field doing physical work). Becomes awkward to socialize with females or remember how to talk when only with males. High turnover rate with employers. Job openings are unsecured, many temp jobs with high termination rate, no job security even when FTE. Employers need to do work that is unsafe, no body covered suits when handling patient wastes that is flying 50mph at you from 100+ feet high (e.g. chutes). The only thing protecting you from the feces in a plastic bag is a glove on your hands, no warning except the sound of the chute with a 60 pound bag flying towards your unprotected body with only gloves. And you could be unaware of knowing what hit you until you become awoken by a ghost."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Organization", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Coordinator in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities, networking, free classes/professional development programs, and great mission", "cons": "Parking, large organization (small fish in a big pond), and long processes."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "12 May 2021", "job_title": "Programmer Analyst in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "hours, soul-fulfilling work, benefits, staff", "cons": "soul-crushing managers who do not care about retention or growth"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Research Assistant II in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, community, safety, location, building", "cons": "Limitations, reporting, space design, slow processing"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "g", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good benefits and good place to work.", "cons": "None that I can think of at the moment."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "I like", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Certified Nursing Assistant CNA in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love the staff.

I would highly recommend it for a new graduate, or someone who values an atmosphere of supportiveness. I can't speak for other departments, but the pediatric emergency department is an incredible place to work. From the manager down, they really employ great people. Almost everyone is friendly, knowledgable, and more than willing to help if you need it. The people I work with make a stressful job much more bearable and I'm extremely grateful for that. \r\n\r\nAs far as pay and benefits go, I have to say I was awestruck when I learned about their starting pay. Currently it's 37.02 an hour for all new nurses (0 years of experience with a BSN). And it goes up every year, all the way to 54 dollars an hour. Coming from Missouri where the starting pay was about 20.50 an hour at most hospitals, this news was a surprise. But that's what you get with a nursing union though. The differentials are impressive as well. There is a 6.00 dollar night differential, 2.30 evening differential, and a 3.70 weekend differential. There are also a multitude of other differentials depending on the circumstance. \r\n\r\nOn top of the compensation, the benefits are impressive too. Full personal medical, dental and vision coverage if you are a full-time employee (0.7 FTE or greater) at no cost to you. There are several options regarding the types of benefits you can choose from and some do cost money. Retirement options at OHSU are excellent as well. You can choose from an state-run self funded pension plan or an employer contribution plan that essentially pays you 12% of your earnings a year to an investment plan, plus a self-funded portion. \r\n\r\nSo far OHSU has more than met my expectations of a positive employment experience. I would absolutely recommend it to other nurses.", "cons": "The worst part of the job is it can be very stressful, especially if you are new and inexperienced. Again I can't speak for other departments, so this downside is likely specific to the department I'm in. As you can imagine children can be a difficult population to care for given their lack of understanding and fear of strange people and places. Add into it parents who are panicked because their child is sick, and you can get into some fairly difficult situations. So ultimately, the job is physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing. \r\n\r\nAside from that the only downside to OHSU is it's location. The state income tax in Oregon is one of the highest in the nation. So about 31.5% of my paychecks go towards taxes (FIT, SIT, WC, and SS). Living in and around Portland is expensive as well, at least compared to suburban/urban Missouri. The commute into and out of Portland is awful as well, if you work normal hours (8:00am-5:00pm). Luckily I work at night an avoid traffic for the most part. \r\n\r\nLastly parking near OHSU \"up on the hill\" is very expensive (14 dollars a day) and can be very frustrating if parking spots are limited. Parking is free at night though. \r\n\r\nOverall the pros outweigh the cons and I would highly recommend this organization."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Senior Research Assistant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Senior Research Assistant in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are a few brilliant minds trying to make OHSU a great place.

Proper equipment was always in the studios, she provided wonderful feedback to instructors, was open to having conversations with clients about which classes best suited their needs, assisted in accommodating instructors when they were in need of a sub etc. \r\n\r\nOverall, the pay for an instructor was decent in comparison to the going rate in Portland. They did offer paid time off, which was a wonderful benefit you almost never find in the fitness industry. Having access to the gym was a positive as well. \r\n\r\nOverall, they have many wonderful clients. People who attended my classes often became regular, friendly faces. I loved teaching here for that reason more than anything.", "cons": "As soon as Michelle left and took on a new position, my experience with OHSU March Wellness went south. I'd worked for them for about 2 years at this point as a very loyal, dedicated employee. I would offer to take on 6 am shifts, sub for others when needed, and even offered to come in and teach when roads were icy and many other employees called in due to dangerous conditions. To say I was disappointed with the management change is an understatement. \r\n\r\nInstead of having support finding a sub when needed, it became our full responsibility if we couldn't find coverage. I realize this is the case with most studios, however I really appreciated Michelle's willingness to help when needed. People tend to respond more to management vs being asked by a co-worker. \r\n\r\nThere came a time when I needed to shift my class to a different day/ time due to a schedule change. Fitness instructors schedules often need to shift slightly, as it is rarely our sole source of income. My intent was to keep the class and shift to a new day/time, or see if they would offer me any other class to teach. I have experience in many movement mediums, and feel they could've taken the time to utilize my skills. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in dance, a 200-hour yoga teacher training certification, can instruct basic pilates, have studied anatomy and physiology, etc. Especially having worked for them for 2 years, I didn't think this would be an issue. They proceeded to have me find a permanent replacement instructor for the class, and took me off of the schedule completely. They mentioned via Email that I should sub as I am able until a time slot opened up for me to teach again. Honestly I was a little frustrated that they showed no sign of appreciation for my teaching there, and instead were seeking out a way to get rid of me. From that point on, I received emails for 2 weeks about people needing subs. There were only two opportunities that arose, and I was unable to take them on due to scheduling conflicts. After those two weeks, I stooped receiving emails about subbing opportunities. By the end of the month, I'd received an email starting that I had \"voluntarily quit' since I was unable to substitute a class that month. At this point, I was a bit offended after everything I've done for the company, and that I'd stopped receiving subbing opportunity emails after the two weeks. How could I take on opportunities if they were not given?  I may have been more forgiving had they taken the time to give me a phone call or an in-person conversation where they could explain their position. I sent an email to both the new manager and upper management about my frustrations with how the whole situation was handled. Nobody wrote me back to even confirm they'd received my message. \r\n\r\nThe March Wellness and Fitness center has an enormous amount of work to do in standing by their mission to provide a holistic heath approach for all. They  can definitely work on being open to employee feedback, rather than dismissing it entirely."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It's going to be entirely dependent on who your boss is", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Senior Research Assistant in Beaverton, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have an amazing boss out at the VGTI who makes work a complete joy.
