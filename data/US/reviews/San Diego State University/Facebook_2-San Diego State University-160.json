being a State Employee, difficult to move up into higher positions. Currently there are a lot of changes so there are lay-offs without filling positions. I have a great boss, however there is still a lot of bureaucracy (although you'll find this at any organization) It seems like their goal is revenue rather that student experience. If you are in charge of running programs, you have limited resources and support from upper management. There is definitely, favoritism, ageism, and sexism. Unless you are covered by one of the unions, there is less chance of you getting a raise. Foundation employees do not match raises that state employees get. These are all things that you will most likely experience at some point in a job position you take elsewhere. No office is perfect but if you are looking to apply to a position, check and ask them directly if there is potential to move up and also ask what their 'company culture' is. Other than that, I feel fortunate to have a good boss. If you have a good boss, they are flexible with your schedule which helps a great deal", "cons": "Low pay if you are in a  lower position, currently there is a lot of disorganization and many people are in fear of loosing there jobs, at times there is high turnovers.
