Many co-workers who speak the same same foreign language will talk badly about other co-workers who aren't fluent in that language while that person present, even though company policy was created to stop this from happening. This issue has persisted for years. There's also an imbalance between the effort different employees put into their work, more so than other places I have worked. When management noticed that some employees had what looked like too much \"free time\", they decided to eliminate some of the positions, and increase the amount of work required for the kitchen positions. They did this even after being notified that the employees they thought had too much \"free time\" were simply not completing their work or leaving it unfinished, leaving it for the harder-working employees to try to complete. Furthermore, servers are discouraged from spending any extra time providing good customer service. I was reprimanded quite a few times by the dining room managers because I kept saying \"hello\" and sometimes even asked residents how they were doing when I first approached a table of people to take orders. Although this only took a few extra seconds, they demanded that I ask \"What do you want?\" as soon as I approached a table of residents to take their orders, and move on if they couldn't answer the question immediately. Some residents occasionally needed some help reading the menu or wanted to know what was in a specific dish, but I was told not to \"waste my time\" on what they regarded as \"useless niceties.\" Lastly, the schedule is posted no more than a week in advance and can change at any time, without notice. If the schedule is changed after the last time you worked a shift, you have to call in to find out. If you don't call in at the right time to find out about the change, and therefore, don't show up for the shift you didn't know you were scheduled for, then they will write you up or will terminate you. Though, being terminated doesn't necessarily mean they won't hire you back. I saw them hire a couple people back just during the time I worked there. I'm guessing they reconsidered after realizing just how much turnover there is with their kitchen staff."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "You Are Better Off Somewhere Else", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Life Enrichment Manager in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The residents are a group of truly incredible people.", "cons": "New employees are paid more and given better titles and are treated better than employees who have stayed loyal to the company for years.
