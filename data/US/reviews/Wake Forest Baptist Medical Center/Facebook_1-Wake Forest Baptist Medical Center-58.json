Headphones were something very casually worn, yet I would be called into the manager on site to stop - while everyone else continued to enjoy this perk. And the real kicker, I had been called into the office and reprimanded because someone complained that I was 'taking too many pee breaks.' After that point I was genuinely disturbed over this meeting. I had no idea what level of disrespect I would receive.
