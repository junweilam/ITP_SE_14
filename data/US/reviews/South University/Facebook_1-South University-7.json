And, they show no sign of actually want to learn. There is no leadership-team interaction, only mandates. In fact, the only time one really hears from a manager is when you do not perform, or when there is a compliance issue that needs to be fulfilled. There is a lot of talk about South University being a 'student-centered' institution, but their notion of student-centered is overpromising and creating expectations in order to admit a warm body to the university.
