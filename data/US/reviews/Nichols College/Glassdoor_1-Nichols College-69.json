Or would that look too much like they actually care who comes & goes? The way this institution is run is, unfortunately, a huge joke. For a college being run by a man who cares deeply about a macho image, it's incredibly ironic how sensitive he is. I've heard dozens of interactions where employees are yelled at, criticized, and scared to lose their jobs all because the President has a hurt ego. He may be great with students, but they're not seeing the behind-the-scenes of the bow tie. For a student body that advocates well for themselves to promote LGBTQIA+, BLM, diversity, etc., you would think they'd want a president that supports the same causes? As a whole, the entire upper administration has unrealistic expectations for a failing college with overworked, underpaid, and mistreated employees. Employee appreciation days twice a year are not enough to make up for being intimidated and scared to lose my job on a daily basis. If you're looking for people that will work 55+ hour work weeks, then you have to compensate them and provide them opportunities for growth. And if they stop hiring only Nichols graduates (not a great look for alumni career outlook btw), a lot fewer people would accept their low-ball job offers at a toxic workplace. The way people are treated is disrespectful and often misogynistic, which should not be a huge surprise. I could go on, but given the current track of the school, it won't even be around in a couple of years to criticize :/ The college has really great potential to help lower-income scholarship students, commuter students, and first-gen students get a solid business degree. But it's becoming clear that shiny new buildings and creating a vineyard-vines-looking campus is a bigger priority than retaining talent to build a brighter future."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Adjuncts not appreciated", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "16 May 2022", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Dudley, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible scheduling of courses, high level of technology available in classrooms.", "cons": "The pay is awful.
