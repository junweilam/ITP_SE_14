I've heard some awful things said about patients who live at the poverty level and patients from the reservation. Their training on how to handle mental health issues is not adequate. Overall I'd say the most frustrating thing about working here is that we have a great community health department who understands these issues, but we get very little time in front of physicians to explain SDOH so they can better serve their patients.
