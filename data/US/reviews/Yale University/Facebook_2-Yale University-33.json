There are some atrocious managers that do not even have a clue on how to manage a department and sadly treat a certain type of employees horrible, but the employees cannot say anything because if they do they will find a way to get rid of you.

Stay two or three years, but leave before your career hits the skids. Yale likes staff members to stay in their lanes, and simply do the job they think you should be forever grateful for having. Each staff position is only responsible for one small piece of the puzzle, so you are never really a process owner, project manager, or true subject matter expert. The result is few people, if any, in my experience, are truly well rounded and learned administrators. Plenty of Directors with dual titles that are simply not up to snuff. Lots a complacent staff who\u2019ve been there the majority of their lives. Human Resources will tell you they love grooming in-house talent for career growth, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case for most. If you\u2019re looking to switch departments or professionally pivot, Yale HR expects you to take a demotion in job grade or even salary on occasion. Why? Because you\u2019re lucky to be there. Or so they believe. They want you to start from scratch professionally or financially if you wish to progress.\nIt\u2019s not terrible if you do your time and hit the road.

For postdoctoral trainees, there is a postdoctoral association and other groups related to career networking (CNSPY or Biomed Career council), and outreach (Science Diplomats) you can join.
