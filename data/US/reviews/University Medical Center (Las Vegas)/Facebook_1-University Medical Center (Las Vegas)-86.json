You would never send a victim to talk to the aggressor so someone being treated poorly in the workplace should not be advised to go back to speak to an aggressor without support or a mediator.\nThank goodness for the Union, the unprotected are just sitting ducks. This is why good leaders are hard to find in this department. It is also the reason no one wants the job in leadership, not lack of intelligence or know how. It\u2019s the requirement to smother your integrity to keep your job.\n\nOur turn over is horrible, the worst I have ever witnessed in all the years I have worked here. Top leadership blames the staff, it isn\u2019t us. We can\u2019t even maintain good supervisors under the current conditions without them demoting or leaving. Reflecting on when it started and what changed in that time would be a good place to start in finding the core of the problem. \n\nI am hoping changes can be made so that we can work together and respect is restored.
