Certain managers are not qualified, lack depth, organizational skillets, genuine commitment in the clinics, experience, proper training, professionalism  and maturity to deal with a range of situations, employees and handle personnel issues with competence.  Clinical staff often are forced to work in suboptimal  working conditions and without proper clinical staffing frequently. Discriminatory and prejudicial tendencies across management are common in several areas. This creates inherent hostile work situations and conditions for unsettling management practices. Promotions are given to select staff without opening up new positions and advertising job opportunities to all employees not enabling fair competition for all positions. Certain managers in place are condescending to staff and some providers in their approach to management. They do not appear to adequately support, intervene or respond when it's needed nor are concerned about following federal or state workplace or personnel  policies. Employees and providers as a whole are not engaged enough, supported nor positively reinforced. Inova HR is virtually non existent, not effective."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Cancer research", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Clinical Research Coordinator in Fairfax, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great investigators that are dedicated to research", "cons": "Not a lot of career growth opportunities"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Inova Health - Good and Bad", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Strategic Sourcing Manager in Falls Church, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Health system dedicated to becoming leading edge", "cons": "Organization is a bit top heavy, decision making can be very slow"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "NICU RN", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Fairfax, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful 108 bed level IV NICU.

The only way to succeed in this environment is to become a favorite or act as everyone else does and push your workload onto other people. If you actually want to help the customers you become REPRIMANDED and SHAMED for doing what is right. Customers are bitter and tired of IT's treatment and expect abuse from all IT departments and employees... with access and other functions going completely unaddressed and sub-par while hospital patients suffer the consequences. The new CIO/CISO, Consuelo \"Connie\" Pilot has mass-fired departments and employees while IT desperately needs to be re-infrastructured and managed and re-organized and motivated from the ground up. Employees get away with doing nothing, while others pick up an insane amount of the work, all the while, the customer, our own doctors and nurses and technicians suffer the greatest penalty.
