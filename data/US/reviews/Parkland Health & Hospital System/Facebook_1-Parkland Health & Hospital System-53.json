Parkland is the very definition of \"safety-net hospital,\" for patients who literally have nowhere else to turn. For those who believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege (and I do,) the new \"New Parkland\" should be well on its way to meeting the needs of Dallas County residents, and be positioned to implement the necessary policies to meet and enforce all compliance issues with all regulatory agencies far into the future. Pay and benefits were acceptable and competitive. Relationships with coworkers, especially longterm coworkers, is like family. For many, many employees and former employees, Parkland is like a 2nd family. Sitting on the rail line is a huge plus. Some former members of the pharmacy leadership team may have \"moved up the chain\" but are still sorely missed.", "cons": "As most people know, the upper management of Parkland totally lost touch with the day to day operations in the prior decade, which led to PHHS nearly being shut down due to the \"too big to fail\" attitude exhibited by too many managers. Mainly by sheer luck and good fortune did they avoid closure. A LOT of really good people - employees, nurses, allied health professional, and physicians - parted company with Parkland during that painful episode. Currently a \"leading\" figure of the PHHS pharmacy department, who inherited the job during the aforementioned shake-up, is another perfect example of the PHHS management philosophy, and is evocative of the memories of years of hospital management gone by, when leaders were completely oblivious of what is \"really\" going on in the trenches. This member of the RX leadership team is out of touch with the RX staff, the patients, the licensed professionals within the pharmacy, and even other managers. Even some more highly-placed members of the hospital's management team are (in my opinion) intimidated by one member of the pharmacy, who makes decisions with an iron fist and manages by fear and intimidation. No one else will make a decision if they even remotely fear that it will displease the one person. Consequently, decisions which need to be made, such as hiring replacements to fill vacancies drag on for months at a time. As a result, this is unfair to the other employees, who have to do their own work PLUS the work of the vacant position, but more to the point, it is unfair to the patients. Ultimately, the patients, and the delivery of quality healthcare to the patients, is the ONLY reason that Parkland exists. This hospital was built and structured (and paid for) by and for the patients, the very residents of Dallas County. When an adequate level of staffing is not provided, be it in Nursing, Pharmacy, or any other department, it is the patients who suffer. And they deserve better.
