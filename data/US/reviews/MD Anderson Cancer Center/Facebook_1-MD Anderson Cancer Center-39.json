There were daily hurdles to jump to make it into work and a lot of it was omitted. The director of the department and HR consultants were also no help. Compared to other TMC parking, MD Anderson, by far has the worst parking I have seen in 15 years and with all the funding and assistance they received, you'd assume it was at least comparable to neighboring entities but it is not. Not only this but with one of my paychecks. It was mailed to me and disputed without explanation or notice. More than 1 week later I found out payroll miscalculated my work hours.

The frontline social workers are doing their best given the limitations of support they have been provided, but it often feels like it is never enough as management continues to raise expectations without an end in sight. Morale is low, and you can feel the tension during staff meetings. No one speaks up anymore with concerns, because everyone is tired and beaten down psychologically. We have lost our diversity as many of our diverse staff have gone within the last year. Management is fostering a department of workers who are silently compliant, which is to their advantage when voicing concerns just creates more trouble for everyone.

With an operating budget of four billion U.S. dollars, the MD Anderson health care enterprise is asserting that it alone will be \"making cancer history (R).\" From a legal prospective, no one else can claim to be \"making cancer history (R).\"\r\n\r\nFor now, let us put aside the obvious question of what would happen to MD Anderson if cancer were history, and let us examine the evidence of how committed MD Anderson is to cancer research.\r\n\r\n1. In fiscal year 2017, MD Anderson allocated ~6% to research. (Operating budget reports are available on MD Anderson's website and these reports are discoverable by Google.)\r\n\r\n2. MD Anderson still does not have a Chief Scientific Officer (an powerless ad interim officer is serving temporarily). A number of research departments are also without a Chair, because the former Chairs have moved on to greener pasture. There has been a mass exodus of faculty scientists from research departments and MD Anderson has only approved faculty searches for a small fraction of these vacant positions. The ranks of research scientists are dwindling at MD Anderson.\r\n\r\n3. Faced with the mass exodus of scientists, instead of changing its environment and culture to better support research, MD Anderson resorts to alternative means to obstruct (well-funded) scientists from leaving, such as using spyware to monitor scientists' activities on the computers (Read the article on Keping Xie's in the Houston Chronicle published Feb 5, 2019.) For other scientists contemplating on moving to other U.S. research institutions, MD Anderson threatens to block these scientists from taking their grant money with them. Additionally, a number of foreign scientists are or have been under unfounded investigations for espionage. It is hard to imagine that scientists would do their best work under such a tangibly hostile environment.\r\n\r\n4. On the ground, morale is low. Only an insignificant minority of MD Anderson scientists work after hours or on the weekends.\r\n\r\n5. Wait. James Allison was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Tasuku Honjo), and Dr. Allison is currently at MD Anderson, so this is sign that MD Anderson fosters a supportive research environment, right?\r\n\r\nIn reality, Dr. Allison's seminal work on CTLA4 published in 1996 was conducted at the University of California, Berkeley (1985 - 2004), and he continued this work at Memorial Sloan-Kettering (2006-2012) and Weil Cornell (2004-2012). The first translational success resulting in the Ipilimumab therapeutic was published in 2010 (N Engl J Med 2010; 363:711-723). Dr. Allison joined MD Anderson in 2012. This temporal sequence of events therefore fails to support the tenuous proposition that MD Anderson played a pivotal in fostering Dr. Allison's scientific success."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "No bad place for a postdoc", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Nov 2010", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Fellow in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good research environment. people are general nice here. good salary if get enrolled in as faculty.

Every 3 months, employees are asked to incorporate new duties while still being responsible for old duties. Workflow is completely reorganized just as frequently, so no one, not even managers, is exactly sure who is supposed to be doing what. Co-workers for the most part are lazy or unqualified and management is unable to do anything about it. As long as an employee clocks in and out on time, Human Resources prevents management from disciplining that employee. This leads to many employees that show up on time, but do as little work as necessary. And the few employees that do work hard are fired because of occasional tardiness. \r\n\r\nDespite great pay and benefits, there is a high rotation for this position. Employees are constantly leaving and new employees are constantly being added to replace them. Training so many new employees puts a strain on current employees already saddled with ever increasing workloads.
