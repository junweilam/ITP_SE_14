Willing to pay for anything the failing football team needs, but refused to acknowledge grad students needs when asking for a small raise so we don't have to take out student loans for grad school. Also claim that they can't provide any sort of tuition waivers as they are a land grant university, but appear to allow some waiver for faculty family members. \r\n\r\nThere were some exclusivity clauses in our grad student handbooks forbidding us to work second jobs if we were a TA, despite the fact we were classified as part-time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, during Obamacare rollout, the university had a grad student health insurance program. As part time employees, TAs don't qualify for the employee plan. When grad students were trying to understand whether or not the university plan met minimum requirements, we got the run around (because it didn't).
