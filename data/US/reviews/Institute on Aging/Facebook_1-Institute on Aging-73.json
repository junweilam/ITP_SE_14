HR has openly discriminated and will not hire people of color or those with even the slightest accents. During my time there, I worked with one manager who was demoted and cycled out of two other \"managers\". Manager is a light term here because people are promoted for no other reason then it's cheaper to promote within than to higher externally into the position. Also keep that in mind. If you're promoted here, you will still be under market rate and likely don't have the experience to succeed at another company because there is no training structure. There is no onboarding structure. When I was there, my now demoted manager forgot to put a request for my laptop. I had to work the first week using my personal laptop. There are also no SOPs (standard operating procedures) to reference for training. The attrition here is so high, no one lasts long enough, or cares enough to put a training SOP together.
