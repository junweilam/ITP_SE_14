The house  doctors are the worse if you call them for anything they act as if you are bothering them. They will make you feel stupid and barely will do rounds on the patients. They act as if they do not get paid and for you to call them is a burden. It  is the worst feeling to know that calling them is so hard and even though you want to help your patient they make you feel bad for calling them. The president is never around. during orientation he gives this great speech about how he will answer call lights and blah blah blah. Not once has he ever walked the floor during my shift or ever heard from him or the educators again.
