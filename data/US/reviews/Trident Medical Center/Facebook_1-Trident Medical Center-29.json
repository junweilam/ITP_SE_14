They did not bring in traveling workers, nor did they help and they expected you to do all of this in 8 hours with no overtime and you did not get any extra pay for doing the work of two. Many long-term employees left and continue to leave and went to HR for help before quitting but HR did absolutely nothing and it became clear HR is there to protect upper management.

Don't bother voicing your concern in a professional manner and trying to improve departmental communication. You'll just get your hand slapped and it won't be confidential, as promised. \n\nNot sure where to even start with upper management. I've seen mediocre management in other Patient Access areas, but in the ER, support from your Manager and Director are basically non-existent. Don't bother asking them for advice or training on anything.  It doesn't help and you'll only get chewed out for not doing something a few weeks later anyway, even though they know you have no training on the matter at hand. \n\nI've worked in a few healthcare facilities previously and I've never seen such chaos and lack of compassion and care. I've worked places where I knew I was getting the best care available, but after working here, I tell my family to pass by this hospital if they ever need to bring me in.\n\nIf you interview here and leave with an amazing, promising feeling, just give it some time.
