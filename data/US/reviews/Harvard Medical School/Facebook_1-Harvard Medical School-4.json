I decided to use the money I saved on transport to rent a place in Fenway...a 10-minute walk to work. I rented the a room from Harvard in a very nice apartment block in Fenway but the rent was about half of my take-home salary ($1200). So I was literally returning half my salary back to Harvard. \r\n\r\nI felt that Harvard could have offered some subsidy to postdocs renting rooms in Harvard's accomodations considering our salary after taxes and social security was only about $2000. I even wrote an email to the President of Harvard University, Drew Faust. Not only did Drew Faust not reply to my email suggestion. She, in fact, got one her subordinates to find which postdoc had the audacity to send an email to her to voice his grievances and then got Dean of the medical school to get in touch with my supervisor to tell me not to bother her any further. I got a stern warning from my boss to not write to Drew Faust again. The moral of this story is that you won't find much warmth among the faculty in Harvard.
