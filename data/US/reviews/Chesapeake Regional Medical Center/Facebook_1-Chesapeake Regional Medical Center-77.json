The decision to demote leaders and to lay off staff a week before Thanksgiving and two weeks before a new CEO arrives is questionable. I hear that they are terminating some leaders under bogus reasons. Reasons that the executive team members could lose their jobs for. If the Board Authority has the ultimate say, then step in already and do things the right way. What I find that is most troubling is that all of the leaders that were laid off or demoted were women. When you speak to anyone here everyone knows of the constant failure of this executive team. There decisions are based on the way a person feels without substantial evidence. I am tired of losing the great ones and being stuck with this mess. Turnover is almost 20% which is double national average but let us not talk about that. I go to a nursing forum to be told that \"we have hired 100 nurses\". Where are they? People are leaving as fast as you hire them. When I say that everyone I know is actively seeking employment elsewhere, I mean everyone I know. Should tell you something. If you are not a white male, you will not advance. I also believe that there is a disproportionately higher salary range for our white male leaders compared to female leaders. Diversity has never been their top priority here.
