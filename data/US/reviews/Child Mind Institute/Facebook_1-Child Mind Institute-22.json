Routinely, decisions are compelled to be made by consensus of a number of influential staff that have no expertise in that particular project. \r\nAnother review mentioned having to work on 'emergency' projects that have become so because of poor planning by management -- this is absolutely accurate, and happens very often, if not weekly.\r\n\r\nJunior staff follows Executives' lead, and work in fear, seeking to avoid being blamed for something. Due to indecisiveness of executives, they lack real direction and leadership, and isn't able to grow. Junior staff has also become infamous for filing complaints with HR or management for any perceived slights.\r\n  \r\nThe president is an NYC socialite, obsessed with celebrities, and a bully, and sets the tone for the organization. It's a running \"joke\" amongst staff that he's feared, unreasonable, and obsessed with celebs.  (there have been quite a few lawsuits found in the public record) YELLS (!) at staff... often.\r\nHe's elitist, and tends to judge staff by their background/connections/school. (which is ironic, knowing his background).  He often creates chaos when he gets an idea or a goal in mind (viable or not), and staff is compelled to make that a top priority, regardless of other projects.\r\n\r\nExtremely high staff turnover -- staff often talks about how people come and go quickly.
