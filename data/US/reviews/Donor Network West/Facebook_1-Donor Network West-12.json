I actually worked at another OPO prior to transitioning to DNW. I have always been connected to the mission but was losing hope in Executive Leadership as I witnessed some very underhanded things happening at my former OPO. I find it strange and pretty ludicrous that I\u2019ve read the CEO at DNW is not connected to the mission and only about numbers because it\u2019s the complete opposite. The CEO is a passionate and compassionate woman who does place an emphasis on numbers in this organization to illustrate how it MATTERS for the number of lives that we SAVE. That\u2019s our entire purpose for being here. The CEO has expectations of every single employee in this organization to do our part to carry out this mission. She is also the same person who takes the time to follow up with outcomes of people she has never met and gets excited to hear that they have been successfully transplanted and are doing well. There has been a lot of change. Most of it is due to former tenured or short term employees who exhibit a sense of entitlement and don\u2019t meet expectations. So change is good. There is room for growth internally and it is supported by leadership. Frontline clinical staff have major flexibility being able to work from home and still meet their compensation demands EVEN if they don\u2019t have to go out on cases. The learning and development department is building and in my opinion finally have the right people in leadership to improve and support our training and ongoing education efforts. Human Resources also finally has a true leader who is well versed in what she does and reliable. There is so much opportunity here. One just has to be connected to our true purpose and willing to actually do the work that is expected of them. There are additionally many benefits provided that most workplaces don\u2019t have. Cell phone allowance, gym or exercise class allowance, and during the terrible hike in gas prices EVERY employee received a gas stipend. I\u2019m not sure where you can find that elsewhere. Especially not in a place where you receive mileage reimbursement (which DNW also provides for some positions ) DEI is a priority as it should be and we have an awesome team of people who ensure we all have learning opportunities for this. I find so much value in this because I whole heartedly believe that some of the reviews of our CEO have a lot to do with the fact that she is a minority woman. It\u2019s unfair!!", "cons": "We are a large and growing OPO who has been short staffed since the day I walked in. The positions are open and remain open because the Bay Area area is an expensive place to live. There needs to be some serious consideration to lobby the board for fair salaries that compete with other Bay Area healthcare facilities. Being short staffed leads to a spiral of things such as employee burn out, no time for training , poor retention and interruption to work life balance. There are some very negative entitled people who are complacent with getting a pay check and not doing the work to earn it. Those people need to be encouraged to move on to their happy place and gladly supported thru their transition because this work is not for everyone and that\u2019s ok. Those who feel like the CEO is insensitive for mentioning the life span of a career in an OPO need to be further educated. This is not the first CEO to share this information. This is DATA from all OPO\u2019s from some period or another. In fact clinical employee lifespan at some point in my career use to be 18 months.
