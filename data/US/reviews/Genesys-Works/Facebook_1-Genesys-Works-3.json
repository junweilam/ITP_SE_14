Because there is no clear strategy or consistent model, there is no alignment around success metrics and therefore no accountability. Executive Directors spend more time convincing their boards that they are doing a good job, rather than just doing a good job. It's a culture of fear in which leaders are more concerned about making themselves look good rather than surfacing and solving real challenges that would lead to improvements in both the culture and the outcomes for students. Leaders seem more interested in maintaining the status quo than embracing new ideas, despite a history of serving fewer students year over year that indicates change is needed. Everyone seems to be channeling all of their energy into fighting to protect something that is really not worth protecting. \n\nThe structure is also a contributing factor to the challenges at Geneys Works. The federated model is confusing and creates a major obstacle to positive change because it's very unclear where and how decisions are made, and who ultimately holds leaders accountable. Great initiatives and innovations have been shut down because of push back and complaints from leaders not willing to do the work or embrace change, and a lack of authority or energy from the CEO in pushing in through anyway because it's best for the organization."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The mission is in the right place but missing leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Manager", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "GW has some of the best employees/coworkers/friends I could have imagined out of working somewhere.
