The pay is VERY low, even among higher ed, and Berklee just refuses to raise pay to retain employees, so people are leaving in droves and they are having trouble hiring replacements, probably because the compensation is so terrible.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to 2022, people are leaving, pay is stagnant, benefits are sub-par, but the institution decided to spend boatloads of money to reorganize parts of the college in ways that are chaotic and harmful to staff morale. I hope that they're right and the reorg does improve things for students, but in the mean time this is one of the last straws for a lot of people who just don't want to deal with the stressful environment anymore.
