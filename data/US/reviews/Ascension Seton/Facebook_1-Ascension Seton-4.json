As Seton is part of Ascension Health, and as they push for more standardization, Seton is the only one that outsources their IT to Dell (maybe in no small part to the HUGE contribution to the Dell Children's Medical Center, or the fact that the top guy in Seton IT, used to be an Account Manager for Dell)... Hmmm.\r\n\r\nThere are also incredible inefficiencies in decision making, as usually it'll take months, and go through 6 different project managers, for a \"project\" just to make a decision, on doing a project.  They'll tell you, that you need a project number to have a project, but then when you actually have a project, and ask for information, and give them the project number, they'll say, they can't look up project numbers...
