There have been several instances during my employment in which an employee would make disparaging comments toward another employee, or myself, during a meeting and not be adequately addressed. By anyone. \r\n\r\nMy efforts to share resources on the psychological impacts of \u201cothering and belonging\u201d in the workplace were not met with accountability, empathy, dialogue, or actionable solutions. This was particularly frustrating when coupled with a suspicious uptick in \u201cminority employee\u201d hires in a presumed effort to capitalize on an optical illusion of diversity, equity and inclusion (Or in Tulane's eyes, $$$). Such modes of thought cannot be completely dismissed, especially given this school\u2019s grisly history and track record of silencing the voices of the historically oppressed. My hunch is that Paul Tulane would \"be awfully proud of dem good ol' boys and complicit gals.\"\r\n\r\nIn light of humor used to diffuse what may be aptly described as a traumatizing work experience, I encourage anyone reading this to exercise their discernment. Don't be afraid to ask \"difficult\" questions because they probe into the professional and overarching social climate of this institution. It could save a lot of time and energy, as well as preserve the mental health of individuals who identify as a minority in terms of race and/or gender. The straws that broke the camel\u2019s back for me include 1) hearing a tenured black employee state \u201cI wish my colleagues and students would treat me with respect\u201d during a DEI meeting, 2) witnessing employees attempt to massage the definition of \u201cminority\u201d as to meet the statistical criteria for a federal research funding opportunity and 3) contempt towards the idea that grants promoting funding for minority health should collaborate with hospitals that have (...wait for it!) a high population of minority patients. What a beautifully straight-forward concept... One should not have to metaphorically pull teeth in order to ensure ethical practices outlined in the Hippocratic oath are properly implemented in all sectors. No place is perfect, but Tulane surely tested my patience.\r\n\r\nShould one consider such position (especially transplants not familiar with the antiquated social hierarchy of \"the Old South\"), I\u2019d advise to keep your moral compass in-tact and to not be afraid to speak out on what would externally be considered egregious behaviors by \"leadership\". Free speech that does not infringe upon the rights of others should be an exercised value within all educational systems. Academia should be a school of diverse thought, not a modern-day plantation for docile BIPOC or any other individual ensnared by indoctrination that creates fictitious hierarchies of worth amongst human lives. \r\n\r\nTulane Univeristy, in my honest opinion, has a LONG way to go in order to create an atmosphere that indiscriminately and sustainably honors the birthright of every human: to feel safe, heard, valued, and mutually respected."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Civil Rights Law Clinic", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Legal Assistant in New Orleans, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can work from home, get experience in a variety of aspects of pro bono legal work, and get supportive and responsive oversight.", "cons": "During the time I was there, the professor I was researching for was out of town, so I was confined to remote work and unable to get any in-person experience with depositions, court proceedings etc."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Very good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New Orleans, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good experience with the baseball team.", "cons": "Long work hours but rewarding."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "PhD student", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Research Assistant in New Orleans, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is good", "cons": "Low salary and not increase year by year"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "first lab job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Lab Technician in New Orleans, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good entry level job working under a professor on lab projects.
