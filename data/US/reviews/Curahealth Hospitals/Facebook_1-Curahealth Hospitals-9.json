They should be getting hospital care, not nursing home care.\r\n Being an employee who saw all the floors, I can tell you unequivocally that the patients on the second and fourth floor are suffering greatly because of this man\u2019s decisions. They are only receiving one hot meal a day and the rest of the day it\u2019s cold items . Everyone deserves a hot meal especially that the rate they are being paid is Hospital rate. They should be getting hospital care, not nursing home care!!\r\n\r\n We had a wonderful CEO before this horrible company took over and unfortunately he was forced out even though rumor has it that he was resigning/retiring. He was forced out the minute this new CEO came on board. I said it from the moment he walked into my office. I told everyone that he would be the CEO within one year and he was. \r\n\r\n In all my working career, I have never ever seen a company come in and strip down the way this one did. They do not care about the employees, patients or patients families! All complaints fall on deaf ears.  The morale is even lower than the basement in that place. It\u2019s a shame, because at one point that place was a joy to work at. Everybody supported everybody and for the most part, still do but there\u2019s nothing to work towards with this new management.\r\n\r\n I don\u2019t see this company being in business with in the next six months. They\u2019ve already gotten rid of Boston and Peabody who they bought in October 2016. Stoughton will be next. \r\n\r\nAlso, Don\u2019t ever look for a raise with this company. The CEOs have come in and have said that there will be no raises. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you work for this company, they will never recognize it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Curahealth Hospital Nashville", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Staff RN in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Provides competent, caring, patient centered care by qualified physicians and staff members.
