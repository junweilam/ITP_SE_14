As a Nurse, I expect more than two days of training before being left to figure out the workings of a nursing unit for myself.  This happened to other new hires as well.  This usually results in a company culture where the experienced nurses \"eat their young.\"  Co-workers would sooner complain to management then help a new employee grow and develop.  I also had to pay $200 for my own orientation that I never received.\n\nDisorganized!  Supplies to change dressings are frequently out of stock or expired.  The supply cart is very disorganized and a lot of time is needlessly spent trying to hunt down supplies rather than tending to patient care.\n\nDangerous!  Electrical outlets (next to resident's beds) frequently spark just centimeters away from the resident.  Oxygen tanks are stored freestanding upright without being chained to a wall or placed in a holder which is a Tank torpedo waiting to happen.  There is no crash cart in which to revive a patient if the need arises.  There is only 1 AED for the entire facility and none of the nurses know where it is and or how to use it. \n\nOutdated!  The facility still utilizes paper charting with carbon paper.  Everything is hand written, the medication administration record, treatment record, and the patient's chart. The computer charting system they do have is scantly used. This leads to a lot of documentation redundancy which is very time intensive.  This takes time away from caring for patients and worsens patient outcomes."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "nursing assistant", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "2 Jan 2016", "job_title": "State Tested Nursing Assistant in Garfield Heights, Cuyahoga, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "loving and caring staff and great residents", "cons": "adminstration cares more about themselves then the people living and working in facility"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Resident assistance", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Resident Assistant in Westlake, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I take care and assist with the residents at the assisted living.
