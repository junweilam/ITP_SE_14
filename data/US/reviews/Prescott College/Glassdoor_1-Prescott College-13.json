So, they prefer to hire non-white, non-Judeo-Christian, non-heterosexual, non-male, non-conservatives. Good for them, but they only do it to check boxes. Once hired, these people are tokens that are marginalized back into their stereotypical roles, such as women being nothing more than secretaries with \u201cDirector\u201d in their job titles.
