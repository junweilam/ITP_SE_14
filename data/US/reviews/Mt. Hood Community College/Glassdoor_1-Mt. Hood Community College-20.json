This inordinate interest also encourages a kind of immaturity in the employees (since nothing is ever their responsibility). They use any free time they have to tattle on each other to their supervisors instead of maturely working out their minor differences like adults. Since no one is encouraged to take responsibility for anything that is not listed specifically in their job description (in fact, they are discouraged from doing anything extra) needed work remains undone, including callbacks, face-to-face student contact, and office cleanup. \r\n\r\nOh! and the worst con of all--the college (believe it or not) does not have a decent incentive program for staff to take their own classes. Instead they have a ridiculously complicated system for getting 3 credits at a time (not enough for even one class). The staff member must pay for all the rest and, unlike most colleges, even this piddly benefit is not transferable to family members.

Funds are wasted on pet projects (while claiming poverty) including a coffee shop in the library even though there are three other existing coffee shops on campus.

The software included annual maintenance which is still paid for even though the ticket dispensers have been warehoused for years. The program was pointed out to be a poor choice prior to the purchase but those at the top moved forward shrugging their shoulders when it predictably failed. When students balked at paying to park and took Tri-Met a \"campus access fee\" was instituted. The Aquatics Center is rarely open to the public though a staggering amount of money is spent each year to set-up then tear-down a pneumatic dome over the outdoor pool. Classified members who become \"yes men\" receive favorable treatment while those who aren't in that group are bullied until they inevitably quit or are put on a \"plan\" which consists of Herculean tasks ending in their termination. Public Safety is virtually non-existent (do to poor management) in the evening as one officer is tasked with the entire campus. The Grounds and Custodial Departments are amazingly understaffed though there always seems to be funding for yet another overpaid administrator. The Faculty were spoiled rotten under a previous President and some have become quite comfortable with abusing Classified members. Those particular Faculty members have an attitude of \"Do you know who I am? Don't you understand I have a Masters/PhD?\" There is a great deal of lip service given by the Administration regarding \"a culture of respect\". In reality back stabbing and blatant lying is the order of the day for upper Management. So many good employees have been driven out or terminated by petty little tyrants wielding their power like drunken monarchs. The only real hope for long term employees is for another institution to purchase the school and fire everyone at the manager level and up. The board is either inept or negligent, they seem to either turn a blind eye to glaring problems or are so caught up in getting their names in the paper as to not care.
