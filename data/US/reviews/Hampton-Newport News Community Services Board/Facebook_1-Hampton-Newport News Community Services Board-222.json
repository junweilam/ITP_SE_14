Also, new supervisor is trying to get rid of those individuals who might be \"trouble\" such those who have mobility problems and those with behavioral issues (which have increased drastically since she started because she makes them do things they don't want to do such as go on outings).  Also, the company has started transferring staff who have been at residences for a long time and sending them to a new house saying that they don't want the employees to get \"too comfortable.\"  However, they do not take into consideration that the people who live in these houses sometimes have no family involvement and look at staff as their family.  Moving staff is causing a lot of problems in the homes.  HNNCSB also doesn't care how these moves are afftecting staff.  They are making staff take positions that interfer with other aspects of life.  For example, making a staff person who had a Sun - Wed morning shift position and moving them to a Wed - Sat evening shift position and not caring that this person has a second job.  HNNCSB is not flexible - their position is \"too bad, if you don't like it, you can leave.\"\r\nSo my advice - if all you care about is pay and benefits, then HNNCSB is your place to work.
