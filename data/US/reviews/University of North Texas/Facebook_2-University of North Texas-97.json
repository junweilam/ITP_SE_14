There is no career progression without changing departments, making advancement nearly non-existent. Many faculty have no concept of what staff do for them, and are often demanding and expect staff to do things that could be accomplished by their teaching assistants if the faculty member had not waited until the last moment to complete a task. Faculty and administrators should stop sending emails to their support staff after a certain hour, or at least not expect them to be read and answered outside of normal 'office hours.'"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Denton, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule, resources readily available.", "cons": "Better pay would be more acceptable."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good experience as starting point for career pursuit", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Teaching Assistant in Denton, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Load of experience in dealing with first hand teaching and interaction with the students.", "cons": "Time consuming and not commensurate to the allocated hours of working per week."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "22 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Seal Beach, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good for students working part time", "cons": "Low pay compared to student expenses"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "My supervisor is very supportive.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Undergraduate Research Assistant in Denton, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible time to work and can work remotely", "cons": "A little low rate for students"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "How was it", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Denton, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Is flexible around class schedule", "cons": "the pay is quite low"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Teaching Assisitant", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Teachining Assistant in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity to Learn teaching experiences.", "cons": "Too much work and long working time."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Graduate Assistant", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Assistant", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great environment to work at", "cons": "parking is usually very hard to find"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Take this job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Technical Writng Tutor in Denton, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Upgraded salary after your first semester, good atmosphere", "cons": "low hours due to university requirements"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "YMMV -

They care about publishing more papers that are theoretical, imagery and unrealizable to get promoted, but they don't spend efforts in their main duty, teaching and eructation.
