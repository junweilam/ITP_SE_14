I understand there are processes that must be followed, but I was never offered an explanation on why the process took as long as it did.  This made me feel disrespected and honestly forgotten.  \r\n\r\nIt's very clear that staff are low priority. Late payments are a common occurrence as I talked more with staff and students. I have no idea how this is an acceptable and legal practice.  The institution isn't going to offer you a loan if they don't pay you - they expect you to have the savings to be able to move states and start a new job.

As a result, some departments are quicker to change and more progressive than others, and salaries seem to be on par with the average but actually feel much lower in the expensive front range area.

Everything at CU invokes committees, sub committees, working groups, etc. I\u2019m pretty certain that most employees don\u2019t do anything but go to meetings, and unfortunately, those meetings generally accomplish nothing.\n- No decision-makers or propriety: everyone, from the ground floor, to middle managers, to vice chancellors and provosts, were afraid to make decisions about anything. Therefore, almost everything was referred to committees (see above), which accomplished nothing and wasted time. The saying \u201cdesigned by a committee\u201d has negative connotations, but at CU, it\u2019s the way of life. I don\u2019t know how anyone thinks groupthink and bandwagoning is healthy, but alas, that\u2019s what we do. Because nobody makes any decisions, nobody is held accountable for institutional failures, such as the ridiculously flawed D2L deployment in 2011.\n- Complete lack of accountability across the enterprise. Personnel: while I appreciated that I couldn\u2019t be fired, there was an abundance of bad apples, unmotivated, lazy or otherwise ineffective employees. Institutionally: the lack of accountability meant massive waste, abuse, inefficiency, and failed/useless projects.\n- Politics: within my last and most recent unit at CU, the amount of kowtowing between teams was insane. We were prohibited from asking questions, making suggestions, or pointing out issues \u2014 even on day to day stuff. For example, my boss believed that submitting a ticket for internet issues at my desk would be deeply offensive to our colleagues in networking.\n- Lack of collaboration: For reasons above, we were unable to openly, transparently, or objectively communicate or collaborate with other teams. I can\u2019t count the number of times my team\u2019s efforts were being duplicated by 22 other groups on campus.\n- Poor treatment of students:  Nobody cares about satisfying or serving our students. Students, despite paying sometimes as much as $55,000 a year, don\u2019t deserve any minimum level of customer service, treatment, ROI, or services. \n- Thankless and guiltless: the work was thankless, and I witnessed a lot of unsavory and ill informed decisions.  I saw millions of dollars be pissed away by the university, with absolutely no sense of stewardship or accountability by anyone. CU is a very expensive school, and it\u2019s high price tag and out of state population more than make up for any \u201clack of state funding\u201d.
