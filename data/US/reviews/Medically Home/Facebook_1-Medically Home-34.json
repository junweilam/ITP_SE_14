You go through about 5 interviews and then told the position has been frozen due to financial restrictions. AKA we would like a better applicant pool because why interview people if you don't have the funds to hire for that position? Ohh, so they also assume your stupid as well. Some departments are legit like working with people who never matured from high school, super cliquey, like love the smell of each others farts and if you disagree with them on anything, looooook out. There's also this whole act like they want to help foster careers. So you start in one position, and they say we value you and anything we can do to help you grow, lets chat......but then when you want to shadow people in other departments or see another side of the model, so that you can potentially \"GROW\"...........\"no sorry we don't have coverage to do that.\" A LOT OF TALK, LITTLE TO NO ACTION. Oh and if you apply to multiple jobs internally, you're told by HR that they don't take your application seriously because you've applied to 2 or 3 positions that you think you could be great at. That's when I knew it was time to get out. So beware! All the people that put in the real work like nurses, service coordinators, doctors, clinical educators, system educators, IT folks, and people in Engagement are really nice.
