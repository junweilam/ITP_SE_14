Each employee comes to the organization with their own 'idea' of what the organization ought to do. Combine this with a complete lack of leadership by the CEO and the result is a fractured, unhealthy and toxic workspace. The CEO has demonstrated she's more interested in increasing her public profile than the greater good of the PATIENTS the agency serves. The HR team is ineffective at executing organizational improvements. The health center harbored a problematic medical professional with a questionable past and appalling behavior. Colleagues that would otherwise be aligned and collaborative were turned against once another, adding fuel to an already-burning firestorm: saboteurs around every corner. Trillium exhibits nothing more than a modern-day Machiavellian culture with a revolving door of managers and leaders. The HR leadership will hire and re-hire the same roles, firing, laying off staffers but NEVER fixing the root cause: the people making decisions. We don't even have the character count to discuss the mis-spendings of the CEO. For an organization so active in fundraising it looks the other way as it employs an assistant to drive the CEO to the office and back home. Financial oversight is a SIGNIFICANT issue. All of this chaos / disruption directly impacts the quality of service the agency provides communities in need of equitable and affirming health care and specialized services. The front-line medical teams are amazing, in spite of a FAILING organization. This health care center is flawed to the point of damaging colleagues professional growth, reputation and mission commitment. The sad irony is that for a center focused on the health & well being of its community it remains damaging and unhealthy to the very community it employs."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Don't do it", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Supervisor in Rochester, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None!
