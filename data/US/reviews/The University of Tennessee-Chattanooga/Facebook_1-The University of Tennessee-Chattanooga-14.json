It's strange because the position requires a bachelor's degree, is classified as a regular staff position (just part-time), requires you to do all duties a full-time staff member would do on the desk, and yet you're treated like a slightly more permanent student assistant instead of a full-blown staff member who contributes to the team.\r\nUnfortunately, this scheduling issue isn't exclusive to part-time staff. A problem part-time and full-time staff face in my department is having to run the desk with no backup.

Great benefits do help balance this, in particular if you have a family.
