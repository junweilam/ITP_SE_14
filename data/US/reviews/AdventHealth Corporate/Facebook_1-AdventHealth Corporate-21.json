Many long-term employees have witnessed the change from what felt like a family-owned business to a corporate environment. Central Florida Division (CFD) IT employees are paid less than IT employees located on the corporate campus in Altamonte Springs - a suburb of Orlando. Despite promises of equal pay, there are still discrepancies for like jobs. IT contracts have been signed without IT vetting. Employee recognition, benefits, and perks vary greatly depending on where and what team you work for Clinicians are constantly being forced to take on more responsibilities which takes away from their attention to patient care Regional IT employees are often left out or overlooked by Corporate initiatives leading those employees to feel as though they don't belong to either the Region or Corporate (All IT employees are Corporate). This is most evident in the Central Florida Region. Corporate pulls in the CFR teams when it's convenient to them such as requiring onsite training or conferences. When it comes to perks related to such things as employee appreciation, they are left to Regional leadership for recognition. Corporate HR leadership fails to demonstrate the Service Standards at times. An example is the head of Corporate HR sent gift cards to Corporate employees for IT Employee Appreciation Day. The email was sent to some regional IT employees. The head of HR refused to acknowledge the mistake nor did she correct the issue; she left it to regional leaders to correct her mistake. When Corporate Leaders fail to set the right example, it sends ripples throughout the entire organization."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good place to work and grow skills", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Technical Product Manager in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work environment, leaders care about employees, lifelong relationships can be formed here", "cons": "Not the highest paying for tech/ product management"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Hurtles in leadership and career growth", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Analyst in Altamonte Springs, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People tend to be very nice and helpful.", "cons": "Unless you are part of the \"in crowd\", you are not considered for a promotion.

It is disheartening to witness such unprofessional behavior and lack of leadership. I hope my review serves as a warning to potential job seekers considering this company. During my time with this organization, I had the unfortunate experience of encountering a manager who prioritized their own interests over the well-being of their team. Whenever a problem or mistake arose, instead of taking responsibility or providing guidance, this manager would swiftly shift blame onto their subordinates. They had a knack for deflecting any criticism or repercussions onto others, effectively leaving their employees to face the consequences alone. What bothered me most was the complete disregard for teamwork and collaboration. In a healthy work environment, a manager should foster an atmosphere of support and trust. However, this individual seemed to relish in exploiting their position of authority to protect their own reputation, even at the expense of their team members. Furthermore, this behavior created a toxic work environment where employees felt constant pressure to cover their tracks and avoid making any mistakes. The fear of being thrown under the bus created an atmosphere of mistrust and paranoia, inhibiting productivity and hindering professional growth. It is worth noting that this manager's actions did not go unnoticed by other colleagues. The negative impact on morale was palpable, with many talented individuals becoming demotivated and disengaged. As a result, the team's performance suffered, and several highly skilled employees left the company, seeking better working conditions elsewhere. I firmly believe that a company's success hinges on effective leadership and fostering a culture of accountability and support. Unfortunately, this manager failed on both fronts. Their unprofessional behavior hindered teamwork, eroded trust, and ultimately damaged the company's reputation. To potential job seekers considering this company, I urge you to thoroughly evaluate the work environment and the leadership before making a decision. Take heed of reviews like this, as they shed light on crucial aspects of the organization that may not be apparent during the hiring process. In conclusion, my experience working under a manager who throws employees under the bus was profoundly negative. The lack of accountability and teamwork created an unhealthy and unproductive work environment. I hope the company addresses these issues promptly to prevent further harm to their employees and overall success."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great exposure, low pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 May 2023", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Altamonte Springs, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great exposure to corporate leadership Work life balance is great", "cons": "Finance at corporate is different than local hospital finance.

On multiple occasions individuals on our team witnessed an individual verbally threaten physical violence against us and other employees, as well as demonstrate abusive behavior. This was reported to HR after an investigation was opened, but many of the abusive behaviors continued and executive leadership either endorsed or ignored the behavior. \r\n\r\nThis individual openly disparaged our director to us the second our director would leave a meeting, and spoke poorly of other directors and our executive leadership to us\u2014oftentimes encouraging us to ignore their orders or insight because they didn\u2019t know as much as they did. I assume this was in an attempt to isolate us from other teams. We were also told point blank that a long standing fellow employee on our team was blocked from a promotion due to personal extreme dislike for that employee\u2014which is unprofessional on a number of levels. This individual also discussed their personal life at length with us, at one time going into explicit detail about their personal sexual life with their spouse.\r\n\r\nDuring peaks of pandemic waves when our team was told by executive leadership that we were remote, we had mandatory meetings at an employee\u2019s house for during work hours, where current workplace mask mandates were not enforced. \r\n\r\nOn multiple occasions, our team attempted to provide feedback about work conditions, but each time it was met with an incredible amount of resistance, defensiveness, and anger from this individual. The feedback was then back onto to the team\u2014as if we were responsible for abusive behavior. \r\n\r\nIn addition to these issues, toxic workplace culture was encouraged on our team. During our transition from remote to hybrid, executive leadership was in agreement about the amount flexibility in our day, but apparently certain people saw it as an opportunity to exert control over their teams. We were verbally berated about our coming and goings and given an assigned seating chart. An individual then took it upon themselves to start tracking the entire department\u2019s attendance\u2014yet this behavior didn\u2019t seem to be discouraged (which is strange considering this wasn\u2019t that person\u2019s role and seems to be a form of time theft). \r\n\r\nThe behavior I witnessed is completely inexcusable for a member of leadership to exemplify. It\u2019s extremely unfortunate AdventHealth leadership allows it and I worry for my past fellow employees who still have to endure this inexcusable behavior. For the safety and health of employees, I don\u2019t believe certain individuals should have any direct reports. \r\n\r\nOverall company culture leaves much to be desired. AdventHealth is openly anti-union and discriminates against people who aren\u2019t Adventist. They only allow seventh day adventists past a certain point into executive leadership and fast track young students from SDA universities into leadership positions. \r\n\r\nAdventHealth\u2019s definitions of \u201cremote\u201d work is purposefully misleading and would actually be called hybrid. At the time of this review, they\u2019re still asking \u201cremote\u201d employees to come in for meetings.\r\n\r\nThe healthcare isn\u2019t even great for a healthcare company? They\u2019re a multi-billionaire \u201cnon-profit\u201d and can\u2019t even give their employees $0 deductible healthcare.\r\n\r\nRaises were not competitive\u2014they didn\u2019t match inflation and junior staff members received higher wages than senior ones."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "I like it!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 May 2022", "job_title": "Talent Acquisition Specialist in Tampa, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Positive and trusting environment\r\nExtremely flexible!

Everyone knows about these kids, but since they\u2019re one of the two largest companies in Orlando, I guess no one bothers to do anything. \n\nThey\u2019re HR staff is rude and disrespectful.

I had a manager demand that I come in to work THE DAY I found out my grandfather passed away. She literally told me to my face that she thought I was lying and that I needed to come into work. I had a few very awful experiences with certain employees calling me racist names, and I reported them to HR. NOTHING happened, they promised they\u2019d help me find a new unit to move to, nope.

That was mainly the only positive at this organization.", "cons": "Let me begin by saying that my opinion reflects the marketing departments throughout Florida Hospital exclusively.  I have no idea what the company culture or compensation is like from a clinical perspective.  As far as I'm concerned, they are very different worlds.  \r\n\r\nMarketing in general (between all of our campuses), was a very gossipy environment, full of \"politics\" and fear of stepping on one another's toes or having to be careful of what you said around certain campuses. I can totally come to expect that from any marketing firm as that is business to a certain degree, but it is rather discouraging when FL Hospital's mantra is to \"Extend the Healing Ministry of Christ\".  It was so not genuine for me when we would pray before meetings but then hear others talking negatively about their coworkers behind their back.  We were almost instructed from day one that Orlando Health was our enemy...we were expected to be excited when things didn't go well with their hospital and were encouraged not to support them in any way.  Looking back, I can't help but find this almost comical. At the end of the day, they are a HOSPITAL and they HELP PEOPLE.  Isn't that everyone's ultimate goal? Sorry, but Orlando Health has the leading level-one trauma center in the Greater Orlando area, and you better believe I will go there if I have the choice.  All in all, working in marketing for a Christian organization felt like a contradictory environment to me.  \r\n\r\nThen there was the dress code that was very strict, but primarily only to females.  I mean, stuff as controlling as saying you can only have one earring per ear, couldn't wear more than one bracelet per wrist, and couldn't dress in a way that would serve as a \"temptation to the men in the workplace\u201d. I by no means consider myself a feminist by its true definition but COME ON.  I'm sorry, but if you don't feel as though the male employees you are hiring can keep it in their pants, then you have a MUCH bigger problem as an organization. I was with Florida Hospital from age 21-22, and as a young, attractive female, felt as though I was targeted simply because of that.  Someone on my team was tasked with the responsibility of telling me I was dressing inappropriately for work, and that there had been \"complaints\".  This particular employee who sat me down was someone I was close with and trusted, and I could tell she was simply being told to do this unwillingly.  I feel that as an adult that I was perfectly capable of being able to discern what is appropriate and what isn't for the workplace and was shocked and humiliated that she was having to tell me this.  Let's be clear: I primarily wear Anthropologie and Gap clothing, and don't even have cleavage.  Either way, I shouldn't have to justify anything for the sake of being a \"temptation\" to the creepy old middle-aged men who are rotting away behind their cubicle walls. \r\n\r\nNow, some of the more practical cons of Florida Hospital.  The health insurance is TERRIBLE.  WORST health insurance I have ever had, which is laughably ironic being I worked for a hospital.  They are so hung up on competing with Orlando Health that many providers are not available to us.  \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a big kicker as far as terrible benefits go: you are forced to take PTO for holidays.  CHRISTIAN holidays at that.  I didn't get paid on Christmas Eve or Christmas because I didn't have enough PTO.  An absolute joke. \r\n\r\nMy ultimate decision to quit came when my boss decided I wasn't valuable enough to deserve a graduate education.  Most employees at Florida Hospital are offered a tuition reimbursement program that assists in paying a certain amount per semester of continued education as long as you sign a contract to remain employed for (I believe) two years following the completion of the education.  Everyone else on my marketing team was eligible for this reimbursement, except for me, the only one who wanted to go back to school.  The reason being was that my employment was contracted differently than the others, a seemingly easy fix.  My boss' response to my desire to further my education?  \"Don't go into student loan debt over it.\"  I was floored.  Keep in mind the dynamics of my team: a small group of kind, WONDERFUL women, the people I mention in the \"pros\" section that I miss every day, and a too-conservative, male boss that was clearly very old fashioned in how he felt men and women should serve.  Wow.  That was the exact moment I knew I wanted nothing to do with this organization."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Taking care of employees during pandemic", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Apr 2020", "job_title": "Manager in Altamonte Springs, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "During COVID-19, tons of companies are furloughing, laying people off, cutting hours and pay, etc. AdventHealth guaranteed pay through the end of May for employed team members to keep us WHOLE.

Maybe that\u2019s how they hire top execs, who has the best talent for presenting negative information to employees and convincing employees that they are actually doing them a favor. How about the creative raise in pay which when scrutinized closely, (shift differential, hourly rate, overtime, holiday pay, etc) and you look at the way it all fits together, you just took a cut in pay, benefits or both and you are supposed to smile and say thank you. Don't bother questioning their suspicious mathematics or reasoning, you already know the answer.\r\n- you are an inconvenience to many employee support departments such as Human Resources, Payroll or Employee Health. They could care less if you have a problem (they try to make it so difficult to actually discuss a valid problem and even if you do manage that, they will either deny that any problem exists, refuse to acknowledge any responsibility for the problem, or you may never get an answer ... they just want you to go away and stop wasting their time, remember you are a nothing to them)\r\n- AdventHealth executive management has no interest in you as a hard-working loyal employee (you are a machine to be used and disposed of when the time comes) They see the physical and emotional exhaustion associated with nursing as part of the job, they don\u2019t want to hear about it, that would require them to show compassion towards the very employees that are integral to making billions for them. You might want do an internet search to see what top executives at AdventHealth make. Hint: Million(s). Times are tough though so the physical and emotional exhaustion nurses go though is only worth a few cents more and, by the way, were short on nurses right now, can you work some overtime because we\u2019ve burnt through more nurses this month than we thought we would and we\u2019re in a bind, you need to be a \u201cteam player\u201d and we\u2019ll toss you a few extra bucks (ouch) because we know you\u2019ll grab at it in the hopes of having some semblance of enjoyable life, that is until we can hire some new machines .. oops sorry nurses \u2026 till we burn them out too.\r\n- little to no chance for advancement, you can work for AdventHealth as a bedside nurse for years and never even get considered for a promotion regardless of whether you further your education, join committees or participate in things which benefit your unit and or hospital (remember upper management has no interest in you and it is extremely challenging, if not near impossible, to move away from the bedside, particularly if you are a good bedside nurse)\r\n- hurricane time in Florida .. bring your own food, bring your own water, bring your own bedding, don't bring your kids though, even if you can't find someone to watch them, remember AdventHealth doesn\u2019t care about you so why would they care about your kids.\r\n- horrible health insurance (most patients have better health insurance), eg. you can buy certain prescription medication for 5 times less without using AdventHealth insurance at a non-AdventHealth pharmacy than you can buy it with AdventHealth insurance. To make it worse, they will call you and tell you \"we would prefer you buy your routine medications from our AdventHealth mail order pharmacy\". Imagine that, got to love those top AdventHealth execs, they are smooth, milking every dime they can out of their 80,000 plus employees, many of whom are nurses, for the very the products and services AdventHealth provides (so much for an employee discount)\r\n \r\nThe Ugly Truth - About AdventHealth - Founded by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church is this \u2026 AdventHealth IS ALL ABOUT MAKING MONEY, THEIR MONEY, AS MUCH IT AS THEY CAN POSSIBLE MAKE, ... PERIOD. They will invest in buying up hospitals, and building new ones, to expand their market share but will burnout nurses at phenomenal rates. They will talk about they care about nurses and \"compassion burnout\" (there\u2019s that propaganda again) but AdventHealth executives have no compassion to begin with, particularly towards the very people that are caring for patients. Unfortunately, this attitude trickles down the management ladder. It is somewhat diffused and aerosolized by the time it reaches lower level management and most unit managers are more understanding and compassionate but you can still occasionally experience the same attitude due to the influences they are under from the upper rungs of the ladder.\r\nAs I am not a Seventh-Day Adventist therefore I cannot comment on their religious beliefs, nor do I feel it relevant to this review. I do however find it offensive the way they use religion to sell their propaganda of how they profess to be doing Christ's work when it is SOOOOOO obvious that all they care about is making money. Religious images are displayed everywhere with righteous and noble captions which obviously executive management doesn't read. Christ would never have treated people the way AdventHealth treats their employees. If you work as a nurse for AdventHealth (formerly Florida Hospital) you are treated as a nothing, and sacrilege (a violation or misuse of what is regarded as sacred) is common place as demonstrated by their behavior. Do an internet search on \"Florida hospital lawsuit millions\" and/or \u201cadventhealth lawsuit millions\u201d and learn more about this \"NOT FOR PROFIT\" hospital, their ethics, morals and Christian values.\r\n \r\nIf you want to work for a hospital, which only cares about making money and burns through nurses at an astounding pace then AdventHealth is for you.\r\n \r\nJust so you also know, AdventHealth has their own nurse factory behind the hospital called AdventHealth University where they crank out new nurses to replace the ones that they burn out but their factory needs to crank up production, they\u2019re burning through nurses faster than they can produce them. Think about it, why would a hospital be running ads for nurses if they have their own nurse factory. AdventHealth would likely tell you that it is because they are growing, which is partially true, but now you also know the rest of the story.\r\n \r\nGood luck in your job hunting."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Awesome place to work at", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Executive Assistant in Orlando, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great culture, hard working staff and amazing benefits and people to work with.
