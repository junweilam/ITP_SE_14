Avoid at all costs.", "cons": "The entire culture of Troy is the pushing of racist mindsets on the other professors. It\u2019s not uncommon for another professor or administrator to hurl racist or bigoted comments about their students or current culture. The university does not punish faculty for giving alcohol to students, asking students to pose sexually in photos, or continually gossip about students, teachers, or admin.\r\n\r\nFaculty will refer to black students with the N-word. I\u2019ve heard admin refer to the black students as a financial burden on society and the university. A department chair referred to the Chinese students with racist impersonations. If you\u2019re not white on this campus then you\u2019re a target for discrimination. Most of the Black/African American students keep their heads down because they\u2019re scared the faculty will fail them just because they can. They (faculty) will mistreat these students constantly.\r\n\r\nIt is a sick and disgusting military influenced work culture. They (admin) don\u2019t help and only pile more and more responsibilities on to the faculty leading to the faculty constantly being over worked and under paid. When there are cutbacks the admin pulls classes and funds from faculty to make their profit. They say this school is non profit but their sole goal is to continually make money and move it around to hide it.\r\n\r\nThe faculty are severely underpaid and understaffed in some departments. The admin and deans hoard funds for their departments while letting other departments languish. For example, a dean is also the department chair and will funnel funds to his department over other departments. This keeps other areas from ever getting accreditation. This same dean will take student funds from all of the departments they oversee to fund events or buy equipment for their department.\r\n\r\nFaulty are told to keep their mouths shut and their opinions to themselves. I\u2019ve seen several faculty fired in my time at Troy for their support of student groups or for blowing the whistle on the work culture. Faculty art told they can't support the atheist organization.\r\n\r\nThe university forces faculty into prayer at work events violating the rights of its staff. They\u2019ll make non Christians pray to their god during work training and announcements. You will be reprimanded if you do not bow your head at the yearly address or at graduation.\r\n\r\nTheir Covid response was horrible. They lost so much money in the spring of 2020 that they forced students and teachers back on campus without any safety precautions in place. Faculty were expected to maintain the same classroom environment regardless of safety. Many students and staff were exposed to Covid and the administration stayed at home working remotely. I was told point blank that the only reason we\u2019re back on campus is to get money from the students and that safety isn\u2019t their concern. The university took government money to buy safety equipment and never distributed it. Thermometers we\u2019re purchased but never given to faculty or staff because we were told it would require two weeks of training to check temperatures. No contract tracing took place. There was no consistency to sanitize communal spaces.\r\n\r\nTroy also increased its online classes tuition during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nI would avoid Troy university at all costs."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Easy workplace", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Troy, AL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Scheduling is very flexible and once you are trained, the job is easy.", "cons": "You cannot work more than 19 hours a week and management was unprofessional."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Fort Meade, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company and benefits.
