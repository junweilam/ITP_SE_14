They TELL YOU that they are all about growth and professional development in the interview, but that's just to get you in the door. This was the general consensus amongst my co-workers.\r\n\r\nMiddle Managment is not as technically competent as they should be to make the decisions they are making about the methodologies and standards (or lack thereof) they employ. The development is way behind the times in terms of standards and best practices. As a developer, you will stagnate. Any suggestions made while I was employed there were disregarded because Managment was not familiar with the technology, and not willing to allow us the time to explore and grow.\r\n\r\nThe department is small. You get to carry a project to it's completion, and are usually the only developer. So, you are most often over worked. Expectations are set for clients by PMs who have no idea how to set timelines. The timlines are mismanaged and production time is always waisted early on. Then, as the developer, you are inevitably expected to make up the time on your end. There is always a project backlog that forces very aggressive deadlines (but this does not translate into job security). And there is no QA process. You are asked to QA your own websites - which is a bit like having a fox watch the hen house - but then, there is no real time set aside for this. You are expected to multitask and crank out projects inside of unrealistic deadlines - but it better be perfect or it's counted against you. And while many of us developers are very good and meticulous, we all make mistakes, and sometimes, under duress we don't catch them all.\r\n\r\nThe company is about \"fit\" - even more than it is about keeping good talent. If at any point in time, for any reason management feels like you no longer \"fit\" - regardless of your work product, or whether or not the reason is legitimate - you will be surreptitiously pushed out. I've seen it happen more than once.\r\n\r\nThe atmoshpere in the office that I worked in was often adversarial and tense. Management had a passive aggressive - and at times condescending management style. Most members of the team had complained about their treatment or the way that they have witnessed others being treated at one time or another.

For a promotion, the worker is almost always a white male (which seems to contradict the \"diverse working environment\" UChicago likes to tout) and appears to always have an unusually close relationship with their boss. In other words, the \"yes\" man is alive and well in this office.\r\n\r\nThe actual team dynamic is disastrous. Micro-management is considered effective management, and I (along with my coworkers) were not trusted to make any type of decisions over programming whatsoever. Ironically, mistakes or failures would then be attributed to the same staff who did not have any control/decision making over those processes to begin with. While HR is aware of team issues and the horrible morale, no steps have been taken to address the situation- and supervisors have never openly recognized it with staff.\r\n\r\nTrust between staff and management is non-existent. I have been made aware of examples when my supervisor has given me directions (which I had in handwriting from them), and then in my following through on those directions, denied any involvement (and blamed me) to those higher-up when it became a problem. \"Throwing Under the Bus\" could be an Olympic sport- and my career at UChicago suffered when I refused to participate (along with some of my coworkers). Staff are very rarely, if ever, thanked for their job. While it seems small, just knowing that someone/anyone recognized my work would have really made a difference in how I felt about my job there.\r\n\r\nAny type of disagreement/criticism with management is severely frowned upon- there have been meetings where people have been expressly asked not to bring any of their issues/concerns to management as they will not be considered (for being too \"negative\" in nature). However, a condescending tone with staff is a hallmark of the office culture. The irony.\r\n\r\nFor a prestigious university with such a hefty endowment (approx. $6.67 billion dollars), as well as the pressure of hitting high goals (with an understaffed team), compensation is significantly less than at local/peer institutions. If you're in development and are looking for competitive pay, you will not find it at UChicago.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the shiny veneer of our logo, the University of Chicago has proven to me that no matter what your non-profit status is or how altruistic your mission statement may be, it exists as a quagmire of the worst aspects of a job.
