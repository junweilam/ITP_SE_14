They were a pleasure to work with and I loved my department!!", "cons": "Management- let me start by saying that I would\u2019ve been employed here 2 years December 2019 as a medical assistant and I started having trouble with management when I asked my \u201csupervisor\u201d at the time for my hired hours back i asked twice. I worked as the only regular employee at U of C Orland Park campus for a min with temp agency employees. My second email was explaining to her that I wanted 8-430 being that i had seniority the only U of C employee I should\u2019ve been able to get my hours I asked and temp agency employees should\u2019ve gotten hours after me. But, it didn\u2019t go that way and me being 4-5 months pregnant at the time my hours was given I knew once I came back from maternity leave my life was going to be a tab bit different and i wasn\u2019t going to be able to work the hours given. Now my stress level was building up  with everything going on around me and I was having a little complication with my pregnancy. At 6 months of pregnancy in May of 2019 I was having constant contractions that had me in the birthing center at least twice a week to be monitored because my contractions was coming (not Braxton Hicks, actual contractions) more and more, my doctor decided he needed to put me on light duty at work i needed to be off my feet. I took my light duty note to my management and was told they had to discuss it and will come let me know. So, about 15-20 minutes later they came up and ask to talk to me, we went in one of the managers office and that\u2019s when i was told that there was no desk work for me and that i had to start my maternity leave that day. A long story short I started my bed rest/maternity leave that day and actually felt relieved for whatever reason that the contractions stopped and my baby actually didn\u2019t come until 9 days after her due date. So now i am to return to work from having my baby in October. The Friday before the Monday that I was to returned I emailed one of the managers around 11am asking to speak with someone because I haven\u2019t heard from anyone after sending my returning to work note to HR and that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to work past 430 due to my newborn baby. The entire day went pass and around 5pm or maybe later cause i have heard from anyone I decided to email the other manager explaining to her that I emailed the one manager this morning the email below (because i emailed her in the email i had sent the other manager) and would like to speak to either one of you before Monday start date. So round 6pm something the first manager I emailed decides to finally pick up the phone and call me. I answered she spoke and said I tried calling you around 1pm something today and I said that\u2019s funny because you are actually my first phone call today which she was.. She started to say that she got my email and that unfortunately they need me to come back with the hours i left with and I explained to her that was going to be our problem because I\u2019m not going to be able to stay pass 430 and that why I tried to talk to you back in January/February when they was trying to figure out our schedules when I sent her that email. She states that she understood my personal side but there\u2019s a professional aspect that they have to go by but come in the Monday and work 8-430 and her and the other manager once again will talk to me about my hours. So I ended up quitting because when she got to talking about a professional aspect of things when the whole time there was nothing professional they did to ME from the email earlier that year about my hours all the way to me returning to work from maternity leave. Everything was UNPROFESSIONAL even when she said she called me around 1pm what ever happen to leaving me a voicemail like professionals do? She never called me that day until i email that second manager who called, text, or emailed her to contact me. Then a week or 2 after I quit I was told another medical assistant like myself had injured her back and they let her work light duty deck work. At that point I\u2019m ready to put a claim in with EEOC because everything was sounding like discrimination to a pregnant person and they wanted me out of there because that jobs had plenty of paperwork for me to do for at least 3 weeks.. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND EMPLOYMENT AT THE ORLAND PARK CAMPUS UNDER THOSE TWO MANAGERS!! THEY ARE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND IS IN NEED OF MANAGEMENT 101 especially the one manager that never managed before she got that position!!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Byzantian bureaucracy, great benefits.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "7 Mar 2013", "job_title": "Desktop Support Manager in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, safe neighborhood, tons of facilities nearby, good cultural attractions on campus, stimulating, smart colleagues.
