The boss (Sam Crow) treats you with respect and kindness, and the dynamic in the office is very chill and friendly. The whole office is very respectful of students having schoolwork as the first priority, and are great about scheduling around classes/other extracurriculars. They train you on just about anything IT-related you would want to know, and have a student meeting every week to give students a place to suggest changes/express frustration/check in. The boss is very conscious of health and the entire office is very COVID-cautious-- sending folks home when needed, and keeping employees in different rooms if working on campus. The work is interesting if you like problem-solving, and very sporadic, allowing plenty of time to work on homework/passion projects as long as you keep on top of the work when it does come up. The boss very much has our backs, as if a customer calls in and is being unreasonable/disrespectful to a student, he will have us escalate the call to him so he can take care of it in the moment, and then report it to their department head so the behavior doesn't continue. Such a great work environment, and such a great place to learn. Very chill with people of people of all races and sexualities/gender identities (that stuff just isn't really talked about, but even though I'm a woman, people don't blink an eye when I mention my girlfriend). It is a very white office, although that's mostly because we don't have a large applicant pool to draw from, and because UO is such a white school. It's also nice that the office dresses pretty casually. I'm among the few women here, but people don't mind if you wear comfy leggings/t-shirts as long as you're decent, especially as a student. Dyed hair/piercings/tattoos are also fine.", "cons": "There is a maximum of 25 hours worked per week which can be difficult to manage if you're trying to live on your own and pay is $12.50/hour, but those are both UO regulation, not their fault. Sometimes the work is tedious/monotonous as many customers have the same problems, but in all honesty the workload is very light, so it's a lot about having something to do in the lulls to stave off boredom. The worst day I've ever had at this job was when an already-angry customer called in and yelled at me for not being able to fix his problem on the spot (I escalated to our next level of staff, and eventually to Sam Crow, and he not only calmed down the customer but also got in direct contact with the person's supervisor to remediate the situation and told me to instantly escalate the call if he ever called in again). Bad calls are pretty rare (maybe 1-2-year), but they aren't fun to deal with when they happen."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Lab Tech", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Lab Technician in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible work Schedule, great health benefits", "cons": "There are no bonuses because Universities don't make money."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Benefits and Learning Opportunities!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Interim Assistant Director for Orientation Programs in Eugene, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for a large public university has a lot of perks!
