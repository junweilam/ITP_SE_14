Not a good place for new grads - really seems to be a place where anyone with any sense of ambition leaves, quickly."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Nice place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Patient Access Coordinator in Erie, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is competitive and good", "cons": "Shifts are not fair sometimes"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "7 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Data Entry Clerk in Pittsburgh, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are alot of good things", "cons": "There aren't any cons I can think of"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Certified Medical Assistant (CMA) in Pittsburgh, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance \r\nCoworkers\r\nRoom for advancement", "cons": "Staffing \r\nWork load\r\nOverall a great place to work"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "great management", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Monroeville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "friendly staff, good pay and benefits", "cons": "high patient to staff ratios, high acuity."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Pay decent, short staffed like every else", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Pittsburgh, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Incentive pay for working extra shifts", "cons": "not enough staff which can make for unsafe situations"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good Employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Patient Attendant in Erie, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work at.", "cons": "Can be overbearing at times."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "The harder you work less recognition you receive", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Nursing in Monroeville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Love the work helping people, have autonomy, feel like I am making a difference within our patients.

The Supervisors never know where theirs heads are- pulling most of the staff on some units and leaving them extremely short staffed. Ever since the pandemic it\u2019s just a mess, the staff is over worked, underpaid, and under valued. No hazard pay for COVID units while the staff has to play RN, aid, dietary, cleaning duty and gets no aid from higher up management.

The center is broke up in to three tiers, which for the (small) size, is ridiculous. In tier 3, we are in que 5 days a week. No exaggeration. You get your head beat in 5 days a week in tier 3, taking calls of all kinds, and then you get a transfer from either tier 1 or tier 2 to cancel an appointment, which is so easy, my 8 year old could do it. You wait 2-3 days for time off approval (i'm used to no more than an hour wait). You are not given any time off up front, you accrue time (five hours every pay period). You have only one bank of personal time, and although we are all working from home now, when in office, most people come to work sick because they don't want to waste their time off. My first vision of being in the office was all of the reps who had cold medicine bottles on their desks. Most of the high level superiors have no background in call center, although our new director does. We will see how that goes. If you are like me, one reason I have stayed in call center work for so long is, despite the industry you are working in, the specific job is always different, but call center life is generally virtually the same, no matter what industry you are in.

For such a young call center, the department is growing fast.", "cons": "Unfortunately beyond the training and appreciation days, that only seem to take the edge off of how expendable they treat their employees, the department is extremely lacking in several areas. After initial training, there is no consistency  within management as far as expectations, quality control, and employee appreciation.  Management does try to push promotion and upward mobility within the department, however they make several false promises along the way. The \"Elite\" position, as it's called, usual is paired with a unreasonable shift for anyone with a family or social life. Management often tells employee's to \"try it out\" and if it doesn't work out they can change shifts, positions, etc. This simply is not the case, once you are in a position they will keep you there as long as it benefits them, with no recognition for how it affects the employee. Which is simply that is just bad business ethics. As far as flexibility with Paid Time Off (PTO) requests, the company does offer great PTO packages, that you will never use in this department. You can never have Monday's off, unless it is part of a full week request. If you try to request the full week , good luck, because it isn't available. Management is usual happy to negotiate a day that would work best for both parties... 6 months down the road.  The only way you get time off is by calling off, which costs you points, on their \"points system.\" The people that have worked there since the beginning of the call center, do get treated reasonably. Everyone else however, not exactly. A lot of the management within the center are extremely under qualified, or have no clue how to do the job they are supervising. They we're simply hired based on management ability at other companies. The knowledge aspect of their job is left to their team leads, who are usually wonderful by the way.
