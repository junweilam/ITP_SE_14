It is very numbers and quota based with unrealistic and strict expectations in an ever fluctuating higher education business. How stressful this becomes really depends on what region and management team you get put with. I started out with a region who's regional director was big on employee morale, so even with high expectations you didn't feel like you could be fired any minute for not performing. You felt comfortable speaking your concerns, but then I got switched to a different region and all that director cared about were the numbers and he wasn't shy about making that known. This then trickled down to the regional director and lower management and thus to the counselors. You have to report your numbers to the entire region nearly every week and explain why you weren't meeting your quotas. It doesn't matter if you have high call activity and work overtime. All they care about in the end is if you met their unreasonable numbers and if not, they put you on a corrective action plan that includes have your work from home time reduced.

The grading structure is incredibly clunky- everything has to be done online.

In addition to that, I'm not given direction on *how* I'm supposed to grade. So, if a different section of the class has the exact same worksheet, I could be grading it completely differently than the other professor and I would have no idea. I've asked for guidance in order to be consistent, and I'm told to wing it. I ask for an answer key to make sure that we're all accepting the same answers, and I was told (I wish I was kidding) to take one of my \"smart student's papers and use that as they key for everyone else.\" I honestly have very serious concerns about the level of education that the students receive- I teach seniors, and their writing style is absolutely atrocious.

You will end up calling up (the same) students who have been out of attendance at least every week, if not multiple times a week.  A big portion of your job success is determined by how many people you can convince to come back to class, essentially putting you into a sales role.  Don't get enough students back in a month?  There go your stats for that month.  The focus, and I can't emphasize this enough, is NOT on the success of your students but by how many you can get back to (probably) wracking up debt.\r\n\r\nOn that note, the other emphasis I mentioned was the debt on your file.  GCU suffers very badly from a rubber band effect.  For example, when student numbers are declining, you're told to get as many back into class and let as much debt keep rolling on as you can.  However, 2-3 months after that you start getting yelled at for how much debt there is, and you are typically given a very small window of time to play \"Collections Agent\" to try and bring it back down.  This, of course, results again in losing a portion of your students.  Also, the number of out-bound dials you make and your daily talk time are monitored very closely. \r\n\r\nThus this negative cycle continues, again and again and again.\r\n\r\nOn that note, if you  are having a difficult time keeping up with this, watch out.  Upper management will have no problem not just constantly berating you, but also calling you out in front of everyone else.  \r\n\r\nAnother thing of note, this is obviously a Christian School.  I knew that going in, but I never really considered myself religious, but had no problem with that.

Decision-making was based more on personality than on research.  When managers needed to make changes, they implemented improvements at their level.  Changes were most often based on the latest research in retention and student services.  They communicated the changes to those just below the C-level, but it was commonly held at that tertiary level.  In any organization, change is a natural but conquerable challenge.  Lack of communication created conflict when executive leadership decided to input their own chosen innovations but were not aware of the systems already operating.  This conflict was apparent in the move from Datatel to CampusVue, clunky implementation of new Learning Management Systems, and tortuously slow movements toward Microsoft's CRM.  Not knowing what was already in-place resulted in changes that wasted resources at the manager level and created unnecessary service interruptions to students.  This lack of communication led to iterative change upon change which, in turn, created nightmares for advisers.  Of course, advisers were targeted as incompetent for not keeping up with each domino as it fell.  \r\nOnly some of this is the CEO's fault.  Those four-digit officers who desperately want to impress the CEO are those who pigeon-hole information; hoping to present it at a time that makes them look best.  However, if the CEO goes in a different direction first, the information is never presented -- it might make the four-digit look bad and lead to a public excoriation during the Ops meeting.   \r\n   Regarding the Christian personality of GCU: the Christian experience at GCU is not organizationally integrated.  It is delivered by the Student Affairs segment of the organization and by some faculty.  The business side (Operations) treats people as no Christian would treat others.  GCU is a business first, and Christian university second.   If leadership thought that changing to a Hindu university would make more money, they would likely replace the Christians."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great University.

Especially when the tuition is a lot more for GCU than the other well known universities. Most students are going to want a diploma that says a well known university, and also save money on tuition.

Moreover, administration are all from online universities or have their degrees from Grand Canyon University (!), so their only paradigm is online instructors which are more facilitators and graders of student-based learning. In fact, there is a very suspicious attitude toward traditional faculty, and if students are doing poorly, they treat it like the faculty is the problem; we are hounded by multiple staffers (reminds me of the Office Space and how everyone badgers about the TPS reports) about what we are doing to get the student back on track.\r\n\r\nThe work environment is hostile and fear-based, consisting of extreme micromanagement and little employee empowerment. The people who last are \"Yes-men;\" making a decision for yourself or voicing an opinion contrary to upper management's is the surest way to be terminated. Faculty are constantly told not to put concerns in writing because it could be used against us. Of course, there is no faculty senate or representation to the administration. Faculty therefore have no input and no way to advocate for better circumstances to improve their job performance. We are told to watch what we say in front of students. We can't advise students to do graduate work elsewhere, even if it's best for them. Upper management motivate by fear and money: they yell and threaten termination, bullying lower managers and staff into submission. Of course, when administration start to feel heat because of this contempt for employees, they give you a bonus and say \"Thank you for all you do...\" Money covers their multitude of sins. It is no wonder why Ken Blanchard had his name removed from the College of Business. \r\n\r\nFaculty have little control over the curriculum: assignments are dictated by online constraints - no quizzes or tests because of cheating, textbooks are governed by profit margins and business deals with publishers (forget using academic quality texts), lectures are not factored into class material, since they are not part of online platform. Most of what we use is wildly out of date or poor, and the assignments we create are really shallow, simplistic, and absurd. Most of the faculty only have masters degrees and so we can't create courses that are cutting edge, because most can't teach that material. We create inferior courses.\r\n\r\nEverything is analytics based, and they will ride you if you are not meeting their predetermined but not communicated standards. Moreover, they have no capacity to value what can't be measured, like classroom preparation or meeting with students.\r\n\r\nThere is a system for everything. This means a task takes forever as you often have to work on three different interfaces or websites to complete a simple task. Moreover, these systems are poorly integrated. For example, LoudCloud - the Learning Management System - organizes students by first name. The faculty portal - a different system - where we enter midterm and final grades organizes students by last name. Also, here's an interesting insight into GCU culture: midterm grades are never shown to the students. Midterms are about assessing the faculty, not the students.\r\n\r\nThe turnover here is a great indicator of the kind of environment you're getting into: 18months. And the administration doesn't bat an eye. The bottom line is: you don't matter to them; if you leave, they'll just fill your spot with someone else, preferably someone unqualified so they'll have no choice but to take the bullying and stick around, since they would never get hired in the same position elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBy way of summary I would say you are micromanaged and disempowered, and you are forced to micromanage and disempower your students. This is destructive of both the work environment and the educational environment. You have a very antagonistic experience with students and colleagues don't want to spend time with each other to build a faculty culture because everyone just wants to get out as quickly as possible."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Exemplary service means nothing if you're not friends with power players.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Enrollment Counselor in Tempe, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay.

The entire training process is not about learning the programs or learning about the university itself it\u2019s about getting someone on the phone long enough to have a conversation with them and hoping that they\u2019ll answer again to sell them on the school so that you can get your X amount of enrollments that you need per month, but we\u2019re not a sales job were \u201ccounselors\u201d.

If you\u2019re going to work for Grand Canyon University or Grand Canyon education I would definitely recommend staying as far away from the University counselor position as possible.

But, we are bend over backwards for students, give them extensions, re-grade papers, etc.  A Christian-based school that doesn't support their own Christian values for their staff. \r\n\r\nStudents complain about everything, even if you give them your entire expectations up-front.  I provided a list of things to do and how to do it with examples, they don't read it, then get mad.  These are graduate students. \r\n\r\nYou have no control over the class size so you can't adequately budget.  You may have a class of 1 student and that pays $500 and then have a class of 8 students that also pay $500.  Or you may have a class of 26 students that pays $2100.  That's about 90 dollars per student for 8 weeks of responding to discussion boards, grading papers every week and grading discussion board, posting announcements.  \r\n\r\nTo treat people this way is horrible.  \r\n\r\nYou charge students over $3k for  class and pay the instructor less than $100. Shame on you.  No wonder they can continue to expand on their campus, advertise, and offer these great things. \r\n\r\nYou get no computer, no compensation for internet, they don't even have the ability use Microsoft Office by logging in.  They are as bad as UBER.\r\n\r\nI feel bad for the students because they aren't getting really instructions.  I was a glorified grader. I sat and graded papers for hours and days on end.  Many of which was subpar. \r\n\r\nDo NOT work at this place.  Actually most fully online adjunct faculty positions are like this.  You would be better off being a tutor."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Finance counselor; good company; good pay.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Finance Counselor in Phoenix, AZ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I really enjoyed my time working for GCU; unlike other online schools it seems they really care about their employees.

GCU is a private, for-profit university attempting to appeal to students as a \"Christian\" university.  I saw nothing in online management I would define as \"Christian\" in the treatment of employees. Working at the ground campus may be different.\r\n\r\nIt was to GCU's detriment that Mr. Mueller was wooed away from UOP/Apollo Group.  Not only did he bring his cronies with him, he has and is creating another UOP where he is the supreme ruler and is surrounded by the minions of his choosing. \r\n\r\nWorking in the Doctoral College, Enrollment Counselors were required to be articulate and educated.  However, leadership spent the majority of time in the office patrolling the area to ensure no one had a mobile phone out or was eating anything more than a snack at his or her desk.  Enrollment is a call center with a call center mentality.  Unreasonable expectations of sales and solicitation calls and dismissal of employees for legitimate medical reasons.  I saw this occur on multiple occasions.  At no point were employees offered FMLA if ill, they were terminated.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are absolutely NO admission requirements for entry into a doctoral program. The ONLY admission requirement is the ability to pay, typically using Title IV funding (Student Loans).  Prospective doctoral students planning to invest a substantial amount of money into an education NEED to consider the value of the degree conferred. \r\n\r\nGCU is an institution not about education; it is about making as much money as possible.
