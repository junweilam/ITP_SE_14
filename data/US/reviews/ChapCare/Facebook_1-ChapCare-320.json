Now, over one year later, I can honestly say that I have never worked with such dedicated and competent clinical staff thus far in my career.", "cons": "Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the administrators who lead the organization.\r\nThe following are 4 of the biggest areas of concern with ChapCare administration:\r\n\r\n1. Certain administrators have created a hostile work environment that has led to extremely high turnover rates in their departments and the loss of numerous dedicated and competent employees (see other reviews on this website).\r\n2. The lack of a formal HR department means that there is nowhere for employees to report their grievances. Furthermore, worker\u2019s compensation cases and temporary disability cases have been mishandled by the informal HR department.\r\n3. The disorganization and lack of communication in various administrative departments have led to serious compromises in patient care. This includes patient appointments being mistakenly canceled on 2 separate occasions for a provider whose first name is similar to another non-clinical staff who called out sick. This also includes the inability to provide patients flu shots because the finance department has not paid its bill.  These are just 2 recent examples of regular, ongoing compromises to patient care due to the incompetence of these departments.\r\n4. The leadership of ChapCare has allowed the above to happen for the last 6 years and has let 2 medical directors and numerous medical providers (doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants) leave due to the above problems without making any changes.\r\n\r\nA clear example of the leadership\u2019s attitude towards their employees occurred at a recent all-staff training. A representative from a risk management firm was invited to speak to the staff regarding workplace safety. The representative included a slide that showed the different types of workers comp claims that were settled in the last several years. When an employee pointed out that the biggest claim was for undue workplace stress (point number 1) and asked the representative what can be done in response, the representative mentioned offering employee stress management classes. That should have been the end of the conversation. However, leadership proceeded to take the microphone and speak at length about how just because the claim was settled does not mean it was a legitimate claim. For the leadership of an organization to respond to employee concerns with such defensiveness and dismissal clearly shows a lack of responsibility for the organization.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, following the resignation of the first medical director under this current administration, the medical providers raised their concerns to the Board of Directors and nothing was done. Now, 6 months after the resignation of the second medical director under this administration, the current group of providers have again raised their concerns to the Board of Directors. Unfortunately, it appears that this time around there still will not be an adequate response. If so, ChapCare will continue to lose dedicated, competent staff, and unfortunately the patients will be the ones to suffer the most."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Unprofessional management creates hostile environment that stifles creativity, growth and teamwork.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Pasadena, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Chapcare has a great mission.

Some of these values include respect and helping/learning from colleagues. Unfortunately, management--the very people who should incorporate and demonstrate such values--do not apply them internally.  Staff is demeaned and unappreciated. I am a well educated person with a versatile skill set that ChapCare claimed was conducive to the needs of the organization as well as the demands of the job. In fact, my job duties were revised to reflect my skills; yet, I rarely received any challenging projects and used very little of my talents. Without any discussion and without my consent, I was given menial receptionist duties and confined to a front desk, none of which was discussed at the job interview. Granted, my pay remained unchanged but I was very unhappy and felt disrespected.\r\n\r\n In addition to being condescended, I was bullied by management, which included a member of the HR department.\r\n\r\nMy immediate supervisor was a terrible communicator who procrastinated and gave very little guidance. In fact, I did not receive any type of training relevant to the daily execution of my job or chap policies. Actually, chap was lacking in several clear policies which I believe is a strategic decision so as to allow for malleability with regard to company rules etc. I am a disabled person and Chap gave me a very difficult time when I requested a reasonable accommodation and further cited random policies to justify certain denials, policies that were nonexistent in the employee handbook.\r\n\r\nCertain members of management form a clique and demonstrate clear nepotism and favoritism. These individuals also lack any college degrees one might expect to see given their status and job titles in the organization.  Further, do not expect your creativity and ideas to be met with a mind that is both open and cognizant of organization needs; you will instead encounter rigidity and insecure defensiveness and will eventually feel demotivated to put forth any meaningful effort.\r\n\r\nOverall, my experience was negative. Management created an unwelcoming and at times; hostile environment. They behaved unprofessionally and childishly and were, in my opinion, the sole cause of why my experience was so terrible and I am certain they are the cause of the high turn over rate at the firm. As an aside, to me, it is abundantly clear that the positive reviews wherein management is encouraged to continue their work, was written by a manager which only further exemplifies how petty these people can be as they are unable to gracefully accept criticism.\r\n\r\nI was terminated from this job. The day of, I had a discussion with my boss about my workload being too light and expressed my concerns that I was underutilized. Later in the afternoon, I was terminated. Though I was glad to be let go, I started that position with high hopes of a long term tenure wherein I would make many positive contributions. It is a shame that I was let go because of my disability, because I was overqualified, and because they were unable to find/provide me with adequate work to utilize my skill set. \r\n\r\nI do not recommend working here as no amount of income or learning experience is worth the disrespect and unprofessionalism displayed."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "CHAPCare IS NOT WHAT THEY PORTRAY THEMSELVES TO BE...", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Medical Provider in Pasadena, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was attracted to CHAPCare because of their mission statement and the ideals to help those in the underserved community.", "cons": "1)    THIS IS A FOR PROFIT COMPANY\r\n    At a meeting, administration did a presentation that showed how much payment is received with each patient visit via their insurance.
