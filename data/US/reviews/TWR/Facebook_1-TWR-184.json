I always felt like I was given the benefit of the doubt. I was able to work remotely, as-needed, shortly after being hired. \r\n\r\nBecause I worked in HR, I was involved in a number of meetings where I saw some of the behind-the-scenes planning on hiring, staff retention, and meeting corporate needs. I feel that, although I wasn't in a leadership role, I gained a different perspective than someone in another department may have because I heard the hearts of fellow co-workers behind closed doors. I would emphasize how \"people-focused\" TWR is; their main concern is the health of their staff--spiritually and in all other aspects.  \r\n\r\nThey have a dynamic mission and vision: a true heart to reach the nations with the gospel. All of the co-workers that I knew well, were the \"real deal\" with their sincerity. \r\n\r\nAfter we had our son, 12 co-workers came to our home to visit us and/or bring dinner the weeks following. I was provided with several weeks paid maternity leave. The company sent us flowers to our home with a card signed by the staff. When I requested to go part-time, mostly remotely, I felt that my department had a \"How can we keep you?\" attitude, as oppose to \"You need to bend to fit what we want.\" I never felt that I was being forced to choose the ministry or my family. I felt that TWR supported my family's needs 100%. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of really cool aspects of TWR related to content that they produce, the projects you could be involved in, and the ability to reach people on the other side of the world with the gospel, but the biggest \"selling point\" to me is how the leadership and staff treat you. I always felt valued, heard, and cared about.", "cons": "The two biggest issues for TWR: pay and upward mobility. \r\n\r\nHR does a great job trying to retain their members with extremely flexible work schedules, the ability to work remotely, and perks like \"discount benefits\" on gym memberships. The reality is, pay is always going to be a struggle when you work for a ministry/non-profit. It is also a challenge if you live in the Triangle, because the cost of housing can be expensive to support a family. I know this is something that the HR team is continually trying to work on -- to create incentives for their staff -- but the truth is, you have to be drawn to TWR for a reason much deeper than pay. You have to fall in-love with the mission and vision and want to serve, otherwise you won't stay.  \r\n\r\nThe lack of upward mobility has more to do with how the company is structured. There isn't a lot of middle management positions. I was at more of an entry-level position, and felt that there wasn't any \"open\" positions between me and the director of my department. Positions could be created, but may be limited by timing and funding. This problem is the ministry's achilles heel for retaining anyone under 35.  I know that the HR Department is actively working on this problem, but it will likely be a slower change."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Family atmosphere, flexible schedule", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "29 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cary, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "TWR is a truly family-style atmosphere.
