What has happened is that the ones they hire have not had any experience/ or ever worked in the areas that they are managing. Very, very poor management, which has lead to widespread employee dissatisfaction. A lot of seasoned nurses have left and gone to other organizations. Beaumont is constantly sending out \"surveys\" to its employees but obviously never listens to employee complaints or suggestions for improvement. If they swept the place clean from Executive management clear through unit managers they may be able to restore Beaumont's reputation. But it will be an uphill battle. Their name is already laughable in many conversations amongst local competitors. Patient satisfaction scores are in the tank, thanks to Beaumont's management. Employee satisfaction scores are in the tank, thanks to Beaumont's management. And as another poster stated, management allows customers to be rude, swear, hit and abuse its employees. That will come back to bite them and I hope to see that because I have seen it happen and the employee was berated, the patient was coddled.

Beaumont caters to \"difficult families\" & \"patient focused care\" even if this means giving in to unreasonable requests & disrespectful behaviors towards our staff. \r\n\r\nThe unit I work on specifically: 4 center @ royal oak. Highest turnover rate of the hospital. Management has accepted this and does very little to try & remedy this or look into better staff retention strategies (except by making new staff sign 1-2 year contracts). We go through ups and very low points repeatedly. Currently we are at an extreme low which forces staff to work large amounts of overtime and with additional patients.  Often times leaving nurses working short and patient safety being jeopardized.  Staffing is always an issue.  The patient population of this unit is very sick & also the unit that has the long-term ventilator or chronically ill (LTACH) patients.  In addition we get the most unstable patients from everywhere in the hospital, until they are intubated or CPR'd at which point the ICU's finally agree to take them.  \r\n\r\n4 Center has some of the most difficult family members to deal with because there are patients that just are not going to get better and family members often are unrealistic about care.  Often times the ethics of what kind of care we are performing is emotionally sickening to staff, and when we do finally get an ethics consult - nothing is ever done. Our unit caters to the unrealistic family desires and wishes even if that means they are blatantly disrespectful to staff members (one example: I have been told I was not allowed to work with their family member because I looked too young, so management says \"I am sorry\" to the family and finds a new nurse that \"looks\" older) We are frequently disrespected or threatened physically by family members, sometimes a police report is filed (but there are many times they are not).  We have staff members assaulted by confused or psychologically unstable patients frequently, for this we now have safety necklaces that can alert everyone on the unit if they are in an unsafe situation. Yes, this helps - however by the time I am backed into a corner and about to get swung at, I am still going to get hit before someone can get down there to help me because the alarm is going off.\r\n\r\nI will never forget a few of the experiences that I have had on this unit relating to being treated disrespectfully but patients or family members, and I will also never forget how appalled I was when I was not supported by management of hospital administrators and the families were basically made VIP because of how they treated us.

Maybe if Management actually cared about their staff, then maybe this floor would not have such a high turnover rate.

I believe that the people who are in Management does not deserve to be in a Management position, they're way out of range in being out of school and forgot what Nursing is all about and what it stands for.

If you want to work here, be prepared for childish e-mails, short staffing every single day, being pulled to other floors that are even more shorter than yours, the laziness of the RN's (a handful of them) who just make everything miserable. Last but not least, your Manager will not be for you and is not truthful in telling you your right's as an employer. Anything you need to know about your rights, GO TO THE EMPLOYEE RESOURCE OFFICE! Otherwise, even HR will SCREW you and tell you, that you had every right to read the Employee Policies at the end of the day since your Manager want's to SCREW you.

Take opportunities elsewhere, you will regret it here. Beaumont isn't what everyone thinks what it is and to be honest, they keep expanding and merging their name into different hospitals, but what is the point of that when your quality of staff is absolutely garbage? They keep saying that they're trying to compete-compete against all these other hospitals and the only one that they can't compete against is University of Michigan Hospital's. WELL NO KIDDING, because they're not so busy EXPANDING-EXPANDING-EXPANDING, they don't need to pay 50 million dollars to be on the Super Bowl and CARING less about how there hospital staffing is...
