So don't go if you are looking for pay! I know that right after I left, they tried to get some winter/holiday benefits pay-wise and management said absolutely not even though it was listed as a benefit in previous years. Dormitories are NOT kept clean. HR and management are completely unorganized. I had a case where my supervisor was incredibly toxic and took her anger out on us workers. She got multiple complaints and the YMCA of the Rockies Snow Mountain Ranch refused to help, they instead extended her contract after multiple serious complaints. High turnover rate and severely understaffed."
