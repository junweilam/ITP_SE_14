Significant forces at the institution want to remain faithful to a certain \"mom and pop shop\" liberal arts college mentality, by remaining small and committed to certain traditions and ad hoc organizational principles. Other forces seem to want to jam this smallish university into the role of a \"research-oriented university\" by committing to growth and to professionalization and corporatization, increasing research and levels of faculty prestige, driving down teaching costs and investing more in IT and research infrastructure, etc. To some degree, some elements of the institution, including  policies and processes, faculty members, administrators, many non-faculty employees and some students have been caught between these conflicting political visions. Feelings have been hurt; some employees paid an emotional and material price for the lack of clarity or the vacillation between the two trends.
