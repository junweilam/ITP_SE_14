I\u2019m sure there are functional labs at Loyola, but the one where I spent 12 months made me completely lose confidence, and it took me 2 years to recover. \r\nBefore Loyola, I worked as a process chemist in an HPLC lab and had a successful 3 years before deciding to start studying for the MCAT. At that point I decided to leverage my technical skills to work amongst clinicians at Loyola. Pay was bad ($17/hr), but I thought I could gain experience and apply for med schools within the year. Turned out to be the worst year of my life. Once I was fired from Loyola I studied computer science at home, applied for the most selective coding bootcamp, and today I\u2019m close to 2 years into a blossoming engineering career making 3x my Loyola salary and feel empowered to grow as an engineer. I\u2019m all the more grateful for my current position, because working at Loyola was a so bad. \r\nTo begin with, it\u2019s still hard to think back to those times. The worst memories at Derm/peptide lab were while working closely with her PhD candidate. She was a lovely international student who was constantly in a state of panic due to the severity of mental abuse at the lab. She had it much worse, because her husband\u2019s visa was dependent on her employment at Loyola. She was worried about her status, and it was palpable. So the midnight assays and 12 hour days seemed fairly necessary. This was the general tone of the lab, perfection or deportation. And as my only coworker, the PhD candidate tried not to transfer her immense stress onto me, but it was impossible when she had just been berated, and her eyes were still puffy from a private cry in the bathroom. Mistakes are made, and in a productive workplace you reflect on how and why those mistakes were made. In the Derm/peptide lab, a mistake is considered an act of sabotage! Everyone in the lab had to work together but leadership made it feel like we were working against each other. Belittling and gaslighting was the norm. I never thought, I\u2019d be the type to cry on the commute from work. Friends and family begged me to quit, but I felt like I was in debt and couldn\u2019t leave until I deserved a letter of recommendation. I hope that the P.I. learns from her mistakes. She might one day have a lab with many researchers, but I cringe at the idea. This review is specific to the Derm/peptide lab, but look out for signs of a toxic workplace. It\u2019s the right move to leave if you\u2019re only digging a ditch."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great place to work in the short run", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Nov 2013", "job_title": "Manager in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, excellent work life balance", "cons": "low pay, little opportunity for advancement within certain divisions, HR department is the worse to interact with, uncertainty of future higher ed landscape due to Washington's shift in policy."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Coordinator", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Coordinator in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Love the work life balance, location, benefits and people.", "cons": "Sometimes politics interfere with the work and affect your job.
