It is important to note that a case manager within an AIDS Action program will get paid considerably less than one within a Fenway Health program.\r\n\r\nEven worse, when staff ask for more support such as: A) on-site behavioral health staff (you know, a no-brainer for people working directly with those impacted by chronical mental illnesses), B) adequate training in responding to suicide prevention/conflict de-escalation, or C) god forbid--compensation that equals the labor you are providing to an organization that does not care, for even a second, about your well-being, you will be ignored, yes'd to death, or worse, black-listed and retaliated against.\r\n\r\nIt's quite easy to understand why these disparities exist; Fenway Health cares about their shiny, impressive health centers that are frequented by the upper-middle class, white, cis-, gay men that attend their events. They don't care about the people of color living in the neighborhoods of Boston that have been historically impacted by the insidious racism that has DIRECTLY led to the extreme disparities in life expectancy between whites and people of color in Boston.
