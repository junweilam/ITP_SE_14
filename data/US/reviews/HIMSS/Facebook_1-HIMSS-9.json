Growth within the company is highly restrictive and often political, and even if you do climb up somehow HR will delay your pay increase for months if they can get away with it.  Preference given to outsiders for new positions. HR relies far too heavily on a clunky and overwrought grading system called Halogen which it doesn\u2019t even train the managers on, making an already grievous process of reducing employee success to a flawed, uncompromising rating scale even worse with user error. Of course, when a manager messes up, they can get away with it. HR also never implements a transition plan, so when employees in unique and critical roles inevitably storm out the door, they take all their experience and knowledge and process with them leaving the rest of the team to pick up the pieces.
