Lovely campus, about 45 minutes away from downtown Milwaukee.  Decent facilities.", "cons": "Huge disconnect between administration and faculty - so bad that the faculty tried to unionize.  Very low faculty morale.  In my former position it was clear to me that the admin considered me low-hanging fruit and never really saw the growth made by our department and how we enhanced the educational experience for all students. Lots of my colleagues share my sentiments."}], []]
