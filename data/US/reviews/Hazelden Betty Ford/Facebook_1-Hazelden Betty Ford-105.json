And yet leaders at the highest level of the organization don't follow them, and HR doesn't enforce them (this includes \"leaders\" making unilateral decisions hiring new team members that interviewing teams/committees have said no to) . When non-leaders point that out, they are often put in positions of retribution that essentially force attrition.\r\n--Constant distraction by \"shiny\" things\r\n--Leaders who have simply never worked anywhere else, so don't know which end is up and micromanage staff to overcompensate\r\n--Complete lack of TRUE strategic plan and execution (though plans and strategy are discussed all the time)\r\n--Toxic culture that is discussed and acknowledged all the time, but nothing is ever done about\r\n--Meetings, meetings, meetings with no action, leaving little time for actual work\r\n--Inability to practice what's core to the mission\r\n--Horrible benefits (a wellness organization that offers no REAL wellness benefits? An EAP is really not a super supportive option for \"wellness\")\r\n--Exceptionally little room for mobility and career progression\r\n--A known \"boys club\"\r\n--A weird combination of severe turn-over and attrition alongside employees who have been there 15, 20, 25, 30 years who have no other context and think dysfunction is normal.\r\n--CONSTANT restructuring: not uncommon to have a different \"leader\" every year.  3 direct supervisors in three years is a direct example of poor executive management At one point, I didn't even have a  supervisor.\r\n--No real job descriptions: no one has one,  and so no one knows how to actually be accountable. Execs refuse to take the time to write job docs and reconcile them for teams.\r\n--As the headline indicates, when an organization is constantly pressing and reviewing on the \"emotional resiliency\" of employees (rather than trying to fix its culture), people should run. This only indicates that the organization's \"mission\" is to bleed employees dry, and then replace with staff that's fresh. It's called purposeful churn. Examples: Known discrepancies in salaries in the same departments that are not addressed, jobs suddenly being reorganized and cut down in responsibility but being paid more (without other jobs being balanced as well), and candidates being hired without the appropriate experience, but being paid more than experienced staff. When a person has \"resiliency\" with those scenarios...\r\n--Complete disconnect between operating units creates chaos and resentment, and the entire organization is set up to be a healthcare operation, when many units have a healthcare focus, but are not healthcare operations."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "No time for self-care", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Clinical Case Manager in Center City, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "High salary at start between $46,000 to 50,000.", "cons": "Internally the company has laid off half of staff over last few years, those left behind had to keep up with patients cases and long hours into the evening or night.
