The employees are constantly expected to hit unrealistic goals, and encouraged to lie to prospective students.  If you don't hit your enrollment goals, they question your integrity.  Management is very unprofessional, talking to employees about other employees, texting during meetings but asking their staff not to, and encouraging an environment of reporting employees to management so they are in better standing with managers.  Your job is NEVER safe.  They have a revolving door policy for employees, and will let you go for absolutely no reason.  Training is a joke.

He let us know that we were recruited into another role that day or, if we refused to accept, we were to leave. Business is not personal but it does require tact, which the CEO unfortunately lacks.

When I worked there, I was told by an authority figure that the way my natural hair grew was \"too intense\" for students and I was asked to \"bring it in\" so I would be more palatable. This administrator told me that there were students who were expressing discomfort about my appearance and specifically my hair. He later denied that students said anything to my direct supervisor, and I was told that it was a miscommunication, but the fact of the matter was that I was a black man with long hair who was asked to change my appearance because it was making people uncomfortable. That is not a positive work environment, and I would have expected so much more from a school that caters largely to low-income students of color.\r\n\r\nWhile I was there, there was also an instructor who would come to us with complaints about her students of color that were blatantly prejudiced in nature. One student in particular who she made complaints about ended up dropping, and it was my job to try and convince the student to stay in an environment where he was being discriminated against. I brought my concerns to my boss as well as hers. In response to my complaint about the instructor, the same white man who told me my hair was \"too intense\" came to my office and assured me that Charter was an institution that respected and cherished diversity. They, like so many other institutions across this country, will tell you that they love diversity in one breath and disparage you for who you are in the next. \r\n\r\nI wasn't planning on saying anything about this, but with everything going on in America right now and so many people of color coming forward with their stories of workplace discrimination I feel I have a responsibility to put this out there. If you are black, indigenous, a person of color, LGBT+, etc. and thinking about working at somewhere like Charter, keep looking. You deserve better experiences than the one I had, and there is a place out there for you that respects you for who you are. \r\n\r\nTo close, I'm sure there are many employees of color at Charter who have never experienced any kind of discrimination and that's wonderful for them. Even so, my experience happened and my experiences at Charter College matter. Charter College can insist that they value diversity until they're blue in the face, but you can't love diversity and allow discriminatory staff and administration to continue without consequences. That's not love, that's lip service."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Stay away from working here!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Canyon Country, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The faculty, staff and students are the very best part to working for Charter. Charter knows that the best way to get their staff to work extra hard for less money than they deserve is to hire very caring and loving people,not always the most qualified or professional.  Even though I no longer work for the company, I take away several quality friendships from both students and coworkers.", "cons": "Where do I start? First of all, Charter College is so shortsighted. They will eliminate positions across all campuses if it means they can save money for a short time. They do not consult with the people directly affected before they make dramatic changes. Also, the turn over rate is deplorable and makes the school look unprofessional when students don't know who to go to for answers. Even worse than that, students don't know where offices are most of the time. I had a position that dealt closely with the students and I moved offices 3 times in 10 months. It made it very difficult for students to find me. Another difficulty with working at Charter was due to having so many bosses. I had 1 or 2 on campus supervisors and another off campus corporate boss to account to. They each assign projects with deadlines and expectations and they each think they are the most important. Finally, I always carried around guilt for the students and the debt they were amassing. Charter is extremely expensive and often the courses do not equip students to make the maximum money in their fields. For example, Dental Assisting students are only trained to be DAs. They are lucky to make 10$ after graduation. It is only after they take an exam to become a Registered Dental Assistant that they have the potential to command more money. The school is not transparent when it comes to explaining that students will still need to pay and apply to be an RDA themselves."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Keep Responding", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Financial in Reno, NV", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great coworkers, great pay, work/life balance.

Dawson is an ultraconservative fraudster who will tell you pointedly that he doesn\u2019t want the government meddling in his affairs, and this is most likely because his affairs are highly unethical and probably flat-out illegal.  It\u2019s no surprise that Charter College is in serious danger of losing its accreditation considering the reckless manner in which Dawson and his group of executive officers conduct themselves both publicly and privately.  While working there, I was appalled daily by the lack of leadership, professionalism, and integrity that was put on for public display.  The college, its curriculum, and its management team are all equally laughable.  The unstated goal of Charter College is to bilk as much money from as many students nationwide before the Feds catch on and shut it all down.  A student with a Charter College degree has about as much leverage in the workforce as a pimple-faced teenager who attended McDonald\u2019s prestigious Hamburger University.  \r\n\r\nI worked in Charter\u2019s Salt Lake City administrative center (briefly located in a shady strip mall next to an equally shady Dollar Store) for three months before mercifully being offered a much higher paying job that better matched my qualifications.  The second I got off the phone after receiving this employment offer, I submitted my resignation effective that very moment.  I probably squealed my tires pulling out of the parking lot in what I can only describe as a feeling of euphoric relief.  For anyone reading this review and thinking about starting a career with Charter College, I have the following words of advice: Don\u2019t.  Run.  Stay unemployed.  Trust me, the threat of homelessness and potential starvation are both better options than working on this Island of Misfit Toys.\r\n\r\nI know Mike Dawson will respond with some garbage about an inflated 90% satisfaction rate among employees or me having \"an ax to grind,\" but neither of those statements are true.  The fact that well over half of all Charter College reviews on Glassdoor discuss a lack of honesty, integrity, and professionalism within its leadership group speaks volumes as to what kind of ship Mike Dawson is captaining.
