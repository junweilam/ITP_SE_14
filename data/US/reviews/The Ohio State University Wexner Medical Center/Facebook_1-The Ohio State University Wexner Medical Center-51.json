I strongly believe that there should have been some sort of work from home option opposed to mandating employees come into the office 3 days a week. I believe it was a poor decision to bring back workers before the mandatory date that the second dose of the vaccine was required. Requiring masks to be worn when in the office obviously shows whoever made this decision to bring back employees doesn\u2019t believe it is safe to be there under regular pre-covid circumstances. Times are changing and the Wexner needs to hop on the wave. Other businesses, not to mention other departments specifically at the Wexner, have given their employees the option to work from home. The hassle involved with carrying equipment back and forth to work and home adds up and causes unnecessary problems. It is also bothersome that we had to buy our own equipment using money out of our own pockets to set up an area to work from home, and now we are back in the office. After having our best year working remotely, it surprises me it was a full time change. Working remote allowed employees to have more time to work rather than sitting in traffic and having to commute to the office. Being emote allowed us to take on the influx of work that came with Covid. I know personally, I am also productive outside of the regular work hours. There are many times I will start working early morning, 6am, which would not be possible if I had to be in the office. Some days are a lot busier than others and having the option to wake up at your desk makes those particular days that much easier. I truly believe working remote will help avoid employee burnout especially for introverts. Working remote promotes a better work life balance and still allows for the same, if not better productivity. I would understand coming back into the office if there were a bunch of problems we are facing, but Microsoft teams has made it easier to be at home than even communicating face to face. Screen sharing on teams has made it even more efficient to work as a team online than in person.

If you go to school at OSU while employed full-time they will pay for your school. They pay half of OSU tuition for kids of employees. This benefit is good, but unfortunately it factors into your benefits package and is part of OSU's justification for paying lower salaries even though most employees never use it.", "cons": "(Same review as I left for Ohio State University. The Med Center is a separate entity but the pros and cons I list are things both entities have in common.) Ohio State does anything and everything to extract money from people. As a student they charge you outrageous tuition and fees. Immediately after graduating they contact you to donate money to the school and as an alumni they never stop hounding you for donations.\r\n\r\nAs an employee, you are required to pay for parking. These are OSU lots, they are not competing with anyone else for these parking spots yet OSU puts its' cost onto the employees. OSU pays less than competitors and says it's because of the \"great benefit package\". The benefits are good surely, but do your homework, ask around to people you know at other big companies and you may find that OSU's benefits aren't actually that much better than other big companies. \r\n\r\nOSU boasts a 14% matching contribution to your retirement account. This can be a great benefit that can offset the lower salaries but be careful. You will default into one of the OPERs retirement plans and in these plans about 33% of that 14% is wiped out by mandatory fees. In the traditional pension plan you have to be at OSU for 5 years before you are 33% vested in your account and for 10 years to be 67% vested, but the remaining 33% is always wiped out for fees. The Alternate Retirement Plan is the best way to keep this great benefit they boast about. The 14% contribution becomes around 13% in this plan and you are completely vested after just 1 year. This way if you get fed up like me you can keep the money that they try very hard not to give you. \r\n\r\nThere are two job classifications at OSU, CCS and A&P. CCS employees are essentially second class employees. They have outdated job titles straight from the 1950's. They have stricter policies that can lead to disciplinary action. They get less vacation time. They need to put in many more years of service at OSU than A&P people to get bumped up to more vacation time levels. \r\n\r\nRed tape abounds at OSU. Change is rare and anything that gets accomplished takes a very long time to do it. A key example of red tape is when I found myself not very busy with my job. I found a simple way I could help my team and take some of their work load. I presented it to my boss. Their response was that I couldn't because it wasn't in my job description. I had never encountered a situation where I asked a boss for more work and they said anything other than, \"sure, thank you for the help.\""}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Campus Job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2019", "job_title": "IT Student Intern in Columbus, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This job was nice because I was able to learn about databases and also learned decent skills about hardware.

Employee performance reviews (P3) have no benefit as managers will do them retrospectively for the previous fiscal year. People who work here are either lifers or using this job as a stepping stone to a better employer (turnover is very high). HR will always let you go than compete with an external offer. Yearly raises barely match inflation and your salary is extremely under market value, even at a public institution. Employees are discouraged to ask questions outside their business unit or even direct team, fostering a culture of silo'd workspaces and non-collaboration. HR management is a joke, I have seen and experienced many people's exit dates, retirement benefits, even visa applications be incorrectly submitted, causing massive operational headaches.
