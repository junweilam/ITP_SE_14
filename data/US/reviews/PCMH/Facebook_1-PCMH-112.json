But the position I initially filled here at PCMH, was only a temporary one. When the opportunity to transition to a long-term position came up, I took it and things have only gone uphill since.\n\nMy first week in the office was great and it was especially interesting meeting everyone I\u2019d been working with remotely in person. My team is incredibly smart, but they\u2019ve never made me feel like a burden whenever I have questions or need further clarification.\n \nAfter only the second week, I knew this job was going to be the one that stuck. I\u2019ve hopped around in my professional career for the past 5 years or so and I was starting to worry that I had commitment issues. But the work is so close to my home and my past experience and skills fit in so well here, it was like a match made in heaven. After the first few weeks, I'd gotten into a routine, and things felt easy for me. \n\nManagement took the COVID situation very seriously and employee safety was the company\u2019s #1 priority in 2020. Even though it was a tough year, they took it all in stride and we\u2019re better now than we\u2019ve ever been. 2020 was a giant pause for all of us, but since the start of 2021 and the roll out of the vaccines, I\u2019ve been steadily progressing in my career here at PCMH and making serious headway on some of my more long-term career goals. \n\nI wake up every morning eager to go work. I try to learn as much as I can, and complete my tasks with enthusiasm and passion. I can\u2019t speak for everyone at the company, but I know my closest coworkers feel the same, because if anything, I would say that I got my current attitude towards my job from them. They have an incredible energy that\u2019s infectious in the best way!\n\nMy time with PCMH has been fantastic and I couldn\u2019t wish for a better experience overall.
