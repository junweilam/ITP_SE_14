The hospital  automatically takes a 30 minute meal break out of staff pay every day.  It is a bad idea to request reimbursement for a meal break you are unable to take. There is no one to cover patients for meal breaks.  If a patient complains you will be fired.  If a Dr. is rude or aggressive to staff & you complain you will be fired.
