Management does not care about their employees wellbeing at all, and treats employees as easily replaceable, although they also can\u2019t ever find enough employees to work here. You will be expected to keep up with an excessive workload because of the continual turnover, and management will not help or support you in any way. There is quite literally no room for advancement in this company. They would rather leave management positions empty for almost 2 years rather than internally hire any of their current employees. All managers are externally hired because there is no trust in or mentoring of the current employees. The work environment can only be described as constant chaos, because some employees are given a huge workload while other employees just sit around gossiping and bad mouthing others all day. Don\u2019t expect your coworkers to support you either, in fact, expect them to throw you under the bus at any moment because of the every man for himself attitude that the company encourages. If you enjoy working in an extremely toxic environment, being treated like you don\u2019t matter at all despite your frantic efforts to keep up with the unsustainable workload, and being degraded by your coworkers, HR, your supervisors, and upper management, then this is the place for you. If you expect a professional work environment free of childish coworkers gossiping and causing drama; to be trained and supported by any of your managers, or to leave work for the day feeling anything other exhausted, frustrated and beaten down, then definitely don\u2019t work here. This company has been the worst place I\u2019ve ever worked, which is sad considering that the point of the organization is to help children with cancer, but that goal is clearly second to stroking the manager\u2019s egos. Working here will mostly just take a toll on your mental health and self-esteem until you find another job, like the majority of the hardworking employees here do. Don\u2019t waste your time, health or humanity working for a company that makes it very clear that they couldn\u2019t care less about you as a human being.\r\n\r\nAdvice to Management\r\nHire new management, especially the senior director, if you want the turnover to stop. Take your managers off of their pedestals and have them actually interact with the employees and expect them to treat employees respectfully. Don\u2019t allow cliques to form or bullying to go on just because one employee has been working with the company longer than another. Management isn\u2019t only about getting the job done. If employees are quitting nonstop, take that as a sign that something needs to change. Stop encouraging bullying and gossiping in the work environment by holding management and older employees accountable for their behavior rather than blame new employees for any problems that were going on long before they started. Start trusting your employees, appreciate them more, and acknowledge that some employees have a much larger workload. This is obvious to everyone, and denying this doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is happening. Your open door policy should also include confidentiality, so that people will feel comfortable speaking on any topic without the fear of repercussion by management or their fellow coworkers because HR and management can not take confidentiality seriously. This company is carefully towing the line of illegality with the way it is run and needs to be completely revamped. Get rid of the older employees that believe they are above being reprimanded for their behavior and continue to cause problems throughout the company."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Committed people working for a good mission and values.
