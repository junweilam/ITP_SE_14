After reading some of the reviews on this site, I felt compelled to post about my experiences at CGRC.\r\n\r\nI have been employed at CGRC for 25 years.  I began my employment as the Executive Assistant to the CEO in 1991.  Throughout the years, I have been promoted several times to various management positions within the organization:  Manager of HR, VP of HR and Adult Services, COO, and now CEO.  CGRC has ALWAYS been an organization dedicated to providing the highest quality behavioral healthcare services to children, families, and adults.  I believe our clinical staff to be the absolute best in the industry, bar none, and I believe wholeheartedly they are the reason for our continued success.  \r\n\r\nDespite what some have posted, I speak for the entire leadership team when I say that CGRC values its employees above all else.  Despite tremendous growth over the past 10 years along with significant financial challenges over the past 3 years, we remain committed to being a family-friendly organization that supports work/life balance.  We support our employees, and we work hard to ensure that they are recognized and rewarded to the extent we can, given our economic challenges.  We are committed to providing staff development and career planning, and we try to promote staff from within at all times.  Are we without organizational challenges?  No.  The past few years have been difficult for our industry, which has led to significant financial challenges to CGRC. We have responded to these challenges with innovation, creativity, and flexibility, with our commitment to providing the highest quality behavioral healthcare services to children, families, and adults guiding all actions and decisions.", "cons": "We had to \u201crightsize\u201d the organization this year.

In rightsizing, we focus on the future and where the organization is headed, and how we can create an organizational structure that is conducive to the successful fulfillment of our mission.  During our rightsizing process, several members of the CGRC family had to leave us.  The decisions on which employees would be impacted were not made lightly or impulsively. We had been discussing such changes for at least a year and explored all other options before taking such actions.   Unfortunately, the rightsizing initiative coupled with our continued efforts to reduce expenses and improve revenues so that we could improve our financial position caused some strain on the organization\u2019s culture.  Some staff, current and former, concluded that the organization was focused on the bottom line and not our staff or clients as a result of our actions.  This could not be further from the truth.  ALL of our actions are guided by our commitment to serving our Mission, which can ONLY be accomplished if we offer the same commitment and dedication to our employees.  As a result of our attention to the fiscal health of CGRC, we were able to design and implement a reorganization of our leadership structure throughout the organization that positions us to be the right size and shape for optimum effectiveness and efficiency in serving the Mission of our organization and achieving our strategic goals for many years to come."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Blended Case Manager in Coatesville, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can work from home, lots of PTO", "cons": "From the start the training lacked consistency and was completely unprepared when I started taking client.

The BHRS department is and has been poorly managed for years and continues to have a high supervisor and clinician turnover. I have witnessed many staff from this department be targeted, harassed and fired for standing up for themselves or for the truth. Clients and families are made to believe that certain resources are available which is not true. Clients are placed on long wait lists while the department scrambles to hire new staff.
