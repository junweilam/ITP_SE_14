Most of them with their current C.V cannot secure an academic job in R1 or R2 schools. For example, an associate professor who published nine papers in very weak journals in his 15-20 years of academic life, judging applicants with much stronger research. \r\n\r\n2- Few students disclosed their traumatic experiences that some tenured faculty discourage underrepresented students such as women, Hispanics, Latin, and black from pursuing a STEM career. \r\n\r\n3- Students spend high tuition fees for very weak curriculums. One can look at the outcome of GRE subject test scores of their best students. Looking into courses, one can easily see that the courses touch the surface of topics.\r\n\r\n4- One of my worse decision in my life. They respect you up to accepting the job; get ready to hear unwelcoming comments about your rank by tenured faculty.

Well the bosses at the time saw it as a bad idea and said they are suppose to through them away in the other building. Well they weren't and a few times people tripped going up stairs so I made that decision to do it anyways because I didn't want to see anyone get hurt nor did I want to get hurt. Well that was one of many things that lead to my unemployment. The business practice is SO bad that they have to tell people to hide OSHA violations. Rather than welcoming them in the building they have to come announced because they don't want to get charged. LL bean welcomes them. Bowdoin here doesn't. \r\n\r\nbenis are going down. if u made 20,000 or under they hand you a benefits card of $350. That was 2014. 2015 came around and went down to $300 and the co pay went from $10 to $20. 2016 they wanted $275 for that card and then 2017 wanted to eliminate that card that helps pay for all this crap. So health care is becoming more expensive over there and people are a lot less happy.\r\n\r\nfree software is good and they say you can get operating systems from them for free. Office you can but they never give you the operating systems when you request them. 5 times i put in for it and no one ever got back to me nor in person.\r\n\r\nAlso I received a very threatening message from a spouse of one of my former bosses over there. I took it to the police as this threat was directed at me and my family. I don't know what I did to tick this guy off but its one of the many reasons to now carry a gun around. I do not take threats lightly. So anyone who says they are treated well here, I don't know what you are talking about. \r\n\r\nNo one matters unless your upper management. They don't care for anyone over there even if you have a documented disability like I did.
