In the US, which includes the New Haven, DC, and New York offices, you should expect to make around $42K (or less) as a research associate, $49K as a coordinator, and $56K as a manager. If you are carrying significant debt from graduate/undergraduate school, it is hard to make ends meet on such a low salary. It is for that reason that most of the people who work there come from wealthy backgrounds, and their parents subsidize their living expenses and/or paid for their university. \r\n\r\nWhile the people who work at IPA are fantastic, the professors who lead on our rigorous academic research gravitate towards studies that lack policy relevance and increase their chance of getting tenure. This can be frustrating for staff and implementing partner organizations. In addition, the professors (or PIs) can be a bit hard to work with, and one has to learn to manage up as an IPA staffer. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, you will need to learn how to deal with incompetent middle and upper management, which is ineffective, poorly trained, and unprofessional. It is imperative that IPA starts hiring managers that know how to delegate and manage people.

No job security - You will be hired to fulfill their needs for projects but once your project is over (usually a year) then you are on your own to find new opportunities. This helps to explain the crazy turnover in the organization.\r\n4. Poor management - Leadership is young and inexperienced. They are very incompetent managing and will try to put the blame on RAs for their lack of proper guidance.\r\n5. No on-boarding- Related to the one above, there is no onboarding to the company (other than links to a few web resources). Literally ALL staff complain about this, yet nothing is done to change this. It is no surprise that most of the projects end up doing things incorrectly when you put freshly arrived RAs to do things they have never done before and without any supervision.\r\n6. No PI involvement - Job postings will often advertise that the position requires working closely with PIs (academics). Nothing is farther from the truth since PIs, specially famous ones, will hardly provide any advice or even contact to their RAs! Younger PIs, not so renowned, are an exemption as they are more interested and engaged.
