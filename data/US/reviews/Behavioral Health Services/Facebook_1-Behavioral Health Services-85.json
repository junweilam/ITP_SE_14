Benefits are acceptable. In general people are interested in their work.", "cons": "There will be a lot of issues that a new employee will have to work through. \r\n\r\nThe Pay: The pay is low. Really low. There are people with bachelors and masters degrees who aren't even making 30K. This place will not reward your talents  and experience with a livable wage. You will instead be exploited for everything you can do and be made to feel like a jerk for asking for more. \"We are a non-profit\" is thrown around anytime someone asks for an increase in pay as a way to guilt hard working people into never knowing their true worth. However, executive staff will drive up in company cars and openly talk about their bonuses. \r\n\r\nOffice Culture: BHS, Inc. provides recovery services throughout the LA area. That being said, the entire company is run like a recovery program. Many people who work there are in recovery and although that isn't a problem per say, it changes the office culture. \r\nPeople come into the office witl all of their character defects, traumas, and emotional issues. Your co-workers will continuously tell you about their recovery it will begin to feel like they are your client. There is a lack of professional boundaries overall and it can be very shocking and  really uncomfortable. People regularly talk ill of one another and thre rumors run wild. There are a lot of office bullies looking to get people in trouble or sabotage work for reasons I've never understood. It's a hostile environment with lots of secrets and whispers everywhere. Many employees are always waiting for the other shoe to drop.\r\nThose that aren't in recovery will be resentfully refereed to as \"normies\". As a result of so many people being in recovery together (e.i. being someone's sponsor/sponsee) nepotism runs deep in the company. \r\n\r\nSenior Management: It's very easy to see the difference between the executive staff that work very hard and those that simply dump their work on their employees. Much of the  executive staff is notoriously hard to work with and lack essential management skills. There are a lot of important titles thrown around (like Regional Manager), but it's easy to see that these titles are not a reflection of work ethic or virtue. There are a lot of very big and very fragile egos that do not know how to conduct themselves in a professional manner or understand how to build people up. Sadly, because of the lack of accountability and skills, executive staff will regularly blame the employees below them for their mistakes and/or take credit for their hard work. There are very few leaders here...just bosses on a power trip."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Licenced Psychiatric Technician", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "8 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Licensed Psychiatric Technician in Pomona, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Worked in Chemical Dependency for almost 19 years.
