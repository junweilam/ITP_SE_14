Management will try to say differently but management is so far removed from the reality of daily life there that they have no idea. Do not even bother teaching here if you are female and not married to a Turk. Being female will mean you will be disrespected constantly by students who have no respect for women, especially women in authority. Not being married to a Turk means despite the harassment by students you will have no top management/administrative support or protection.
