The administrative staff really got to know the residents individually, so any issues were resolved with knowledge of the resident in mind, rather than just blindly taking action. \r\n\r\nMoney/Profit is an issue, of course, but not so much that it impedes care. This place doesn't cut corners, and the abuse reporting/investigating procedures are top-notch. Training is great for most positions. \r\n\r\nI've worked at companies where everyone is a nervous wreck when corporate comes around, because the upper management is out of touch, rash, and blindly making decisions that negatively affect the employees as well as the care provided. This wasn't the experience I had at LSS.

A certain member of management will be nice just long enough to get you in the door, as it was explained to me by a current employee.

This certain member of management was EXTREMELY difficult to work with and seems much more interested in doing her own work and in not being bothered than in anything else, including training you, your reputation, the reputation of  the company and how she is impacting it, and her employees.  She is a HORRIBLE boss and trainer and she assumes that because she knows, you should know.  You might hear, how I did, how she has sent other employees home crying many times because she is simply impossible to work with.  I was told, as an explanation for her behavior, \"You think she's bad now? You should have seen her years ago, she's improved, trust me!\"  You will be expected to know how to operate their very confusing software with no opportunity to ask questions and will discover that no one else has the time to train you and you  will keep being reminded of how overly stressed and overworked everyone is. Your every move WILL BE monitored from a person on the team that this certain member of management has appropriated to watch you and report back to her, this was also put in writing.  When you try to offer ANY explanation as to the outright untruths in what this certain member of management  was told and has accused you of in writing, you could be told by her boss, as I was, that this employee \"could not lie if her life depended on it\".

I was told that this manager, in her opinion, is virtually a perfect employee, and that they have worked together for years and you will not be allowed to SAY ONE SINGLE SENTENCE.  You will notice how attitudes and demeanors magically change and become professional and supportive of you whenever managers from another area are within ear shot.  This certain member of  management went on vacation right after I started working there and I was told in the morning, the day that she returned, with her face crimson from anger,  to \"Get away from my desk!\" when all I did was ASK HER FOR MORE WORK.  When an employee that sits by you walks up to you, on their own, after witnessing the way that this person has treated you, in front of other employees, and says, \"It's not you, it's HER, she treats us all like this, you'll get used it, like we all have, it's NOT you!\", you realize IMMEDIATELY what a HUGE mistake that you have made in taking this job.
