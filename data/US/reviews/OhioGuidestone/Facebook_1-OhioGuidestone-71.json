You can get a bonus based on an unrealistic productivity system. Made to feel like a number rather than a person. \r\nThey increased productivity during the pandemic from 52% to 58%, but client engagement got harder due to telehealth so achieving productivity is often unrealistic. Productivity is based solely on billable time with clients rather than all the other work that goes into your job description. E.G, mandatory trainings, monthly meetings, calling to schedule clients, paperwork, creating session plans, ANYTHING that takes up time in your day but they can\u2019t get $$ for, does not contribute to productivity. I am constantly stressed. \r\nIn order to make productivity, you are expected to be available whenever the client is available. This means worker longer days (I worked 10 hour days for a while) but not overtime is allowed. So I would type notes \u201coff the clock\u201d.\r\nThey recently started a contract to assist with crisis assessments and expect people to sign up to complete assessments. You have to clear your schedule on the off chance you get a call, meaning you miss out on productivity from actual clients. They make this seem \u201clike a game\u201d, if you don\u2019t voluntarily sign up, they will \u201cpick a winner\u201d to do it instead. \r\nYou\u2019re expected to always be available for clients, even on days off. \r\nThey advertise a minimum of 2 weeks vacation, but aren\u2019t guaranteed it. You have to accrue it throughout the year; so 1 week per 6 months. You don\u2019t \u2018earn\u2019 more until you have been here for 3 years. \r\nI am lucky to have a nice supervisor, but other supervisors can be rude, condescending and very cliquey.
