Run and don't look back\r\n\r\nManagement seems charming at first, but they have run the Speech and language department into the ground. They're so fragile and defensive that you will NEVER be able to disagree with them or state an opinion that they don't like.\r\n\r\nThey always choose one CF to gang up on every year, and it's depressing to watch. They bully at least one into leaving KKI every year. Micromanagement is something everyone deals with all day, every day. As a new hire, every eval you do and every report you write is intensely watched and criticized. The supervisors are extremely nosy and make you CC them on almost every single email. There's someone constantly looking over your shoulder for your first six months AT LEAST>\r\n\r\nAside from when you go from CF to getting your Cs, you won't get another raise or promotion for YEARS, if at all, no matter how hard you work. They will never negotiate salary with you, and they have no interest in having you advance in the organization. You\u2019ll be underpaid, and they won\u2019t care. \r\n\r\nThe amount of turnover is shocking. They go through administrative assistants constantly and take forever to replace them. As of this month, the dept. has lost 6 SLPs in less than 18 months. They take forever to replace SLPs too- prepare to cover both your workload AND the workload of the person who leaves when this happens, because the supervisors won\u2019t help at all. Management is completely unwilling to accept feedback and change-- they just make the other staff do all of that work on their own personal time. \r\n\r\nThe workload is ridiculous. People stay well past their scheduled hours every single day to finish reports and other responsibilities. Some SLPs even take work home with them to do on the weekends. \r\n\r\nPlease, please don't work here. Management will make your life miserable, unless you're a really passive person who doesn't mind being bossed around and you never speak up for yourself. This department is a mess. Also...HR will never care about your concerns. Everyone has tried to warn them about how unhappy the staff is, and they\u2019ve done absolutely nothing. They don't listen AT ALL to what's wrong with the department, though they definitely pretend to. \r\n\r\nI get that you want to work somewhere reputable and well known. I was just like you once. I thought that this place would make a huge difference for my career. Please understand that speech and language isn't like the rest of KKI.
