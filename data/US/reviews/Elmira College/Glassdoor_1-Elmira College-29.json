The college says its recent cuts were because of \"financial exigency\" (something the full faculty learned about only as several of them were fired at the end of the last academic year) because of the pandemic, but that is not the case.\r\n\r\nA few select people make all of the decisions at this college and others, including the students, pay the price. There is a culture of backstabbing among the faculty that is encouraged by the administration. I would steer clear of this place as both a place of employment and a place to get an education. The quality of the education has diminished significantly, despite what the college's advertising says. The college has been in financial trouble for a long time, and using the pandemic as an excuse to fire long-term faculty and administrators is morally bankrupt. This is not a place you want to work."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Director", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Sept 2016", "job_title": " in Elmira, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are many hard working people on Campus that would like to see the College move forward.", "cons": "The new Upper Management really has no clue.
