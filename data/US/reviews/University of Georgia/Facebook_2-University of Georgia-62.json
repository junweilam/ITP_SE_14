Mission creep is an understatement at UGA.\r\n\r\nEmployees are told they have to cover vacant positions with no supplemental pay while Directors have huge pots of money to play with, often at the expense of the labor force which is working 2-3 jobs apiece due to the high turnover at the university.\r\n\r\nStaff are not being treated well at all and no one cares.\r\n\r\nBasically, no HR department to look into management practices.

Salaries are extremely lacking but the university refuses to change because people want to be able to say they work for UGA. There is a strong presence of discontent across many areas of employees with the university. My experience cannot be applied to the university as a whole because I know there are some great professionals that work here. However, within student affairs and my department specifically, there is a system of rewarding people who are willing to go-with-the-flow. Hard working people are often taken advantage of by over-delegation and if they are willing to express concerns, they are seen as troublemakers and punished in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. I have seen it happen to many of my co-workers over the years and many of them have left disgruntled. It is unfortunate but all of us have lost faith that the right thing will will happen anymore. I hope that things can change for the sake of the students and the hard-working professionals.
