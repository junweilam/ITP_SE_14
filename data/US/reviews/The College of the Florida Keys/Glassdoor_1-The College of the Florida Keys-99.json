There is a revolving door of employees. They have a SIX MONTH probation period, and they routinely fire people even 5.5 months in even if they have moved across the country for the position and done a stellar job. They do this all the time. They let great people go suddenly for no reason and then promote whomever is standing next to them regardless of qualifications. They exclude people from things like birthday parties like it's high school.  They try to manage employee relationships of which they disapprove in the community; Key West is a very small town, so there's little privacy. HR is unhelpful to both management and staff.
