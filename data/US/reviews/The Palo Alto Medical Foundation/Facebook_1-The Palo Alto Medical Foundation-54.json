In fact, all of us doctors were put in trainings to teach us how to bill the patient more.  We are even in meetings where some of the top paid doctors discuss how to use tax evasion to our benefit.  Several doctors, the good ones, have all quit, so this place is very desperate in hiring.  Some of the other departments may have better leaders, but overall, PAMF is under a productivity model, where the doctors are under pressure to bill more at the patient's expense so that they can get paid more proportionally themselves.  Additionally, there is a huge gender bias.  If you start unveiling the dirt, the male doctors are praised for unethical practices described above and thus are paid more.
