The MAs do their best but there is no training for them and they are overwhelmed, high turn over. Clinic management is nonexistent, not fully trained in day to day organization and triage of patients. \n\nUses the worst EHR that does not transfer orders, most orders are done with paper that changes hands 5 times and 20-25% of the orders get lost. I left to protect my medical license. Management is not local and does not care about staff nor patients and does not change or update based on clinicians protests to urgently make changes to protect patients. Administration has said they would get a new EHR for the last 4 years. They just promise and do not follow through. \n\nEvery primary care doctor (with one exception) has left this place and most of the NPs and PAs have as well. They violated the California Medical Board's law against corporate practice of medicine on multiple occasions, I brought this to their attention, they don't care. I have also heard second hand questionable practices of breaking Stark Law.\n\nThe building is so old I know of at least 3 providers who have lung issues after working in the clinic, they decided to re-paint the molded walls when I complained with a potential law suit - did not fix the problem.\n\nClinicians are very drained after even a 4 day work week - VERY HIGH BURN OUT.\n\nAvoid this place, maybe it will close and then someone will re-open with management who care about local patients.\n\nOh and I also found out they were paying me 35% less than the standard."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Please do not work here, do not seek medical care here", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Willows, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only pro of working at this facility was seeing what a poor and unsafe hospital looks like and allowing me to appreciate every job going forward from Glenn Medical.", "cons": "Please, if you are considering working here and you have a medical license of any type just move on.

Patient safety is never a priority, only money made. Nurses frequently are out of ratio and bullied into unsafe situations. Patients are often treated poorly because of staffing issues, an outdated facility, and lack of experienced staff, think hospital rooms that are 90 degrees in the summer, cockroaches, bedsores, staff using porta potties, med errors. All situations I encountered daily. The HR department is a nightmare. This department will lie about wages, benefits, even hire employees without verifying licences. I wish none of this was true, and I truly encourage you to seek employment elsewhere, this is not a place you want to be wrapped up in.
