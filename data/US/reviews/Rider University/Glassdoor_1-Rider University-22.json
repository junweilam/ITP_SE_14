Instead of bringing everyone together and be a team, I had noticed that many managers would mistreat subordinates due to their lower class, education and salary.  Such a shame.  Some managers do not care about their employees at all, shaming them for having families/children and missing out on work due to unforeseen circumstances, but the managers would take long vacations, come in to work hours late, take numerous hour lunches, but that was fine.  Shame on you Rider!!!"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Institution in decline", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Lawrenceville, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a job where you get to interact with a lot of young people and some of those interactions can be very fulfilling.", "cons": "No raises for the last 3 years, declining benefits (403b contribution dropped by 70% in Jul 2015), horrible systems, dated management philosophies and expectations that you do even more work (over normal working hours) for less pay and benefits.\r\nI'm sure more people would complain about the things that go on at Rider (and the things long term employees get away with) but the HR office is feckless and seemingly completely engaged in protecting the university versus protecting the worker."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Office Assistant Conference Servies", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Office Assistant in Lawrenceville, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to meet great people through all of the external events that are held on campus.
