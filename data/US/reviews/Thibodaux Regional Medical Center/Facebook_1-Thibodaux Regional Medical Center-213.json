If you teach a fitness class there and have no students show up to class, you do not get paid!\r\n2. If you report something to management, they won't do anything about it and you'll get labeled as a trouble maker or a chronic complainer!\r\n3. You have to work with equipment that is falling apart or not kept to current safety standards. You report it to management and they do nothing about it. You will have to decide yourself to remove faulty equipment away from member's use so they won't hurt themselves.\r\n4. There are 4 fitness studios there. If you teach fitness classes you will have to contend with hearing the class next door's music and instructor over the microphone in your studio. Then if you turn your music up to try to drown out the noise from the next class, your members in your class will complain to management about your music being too loud. You can't win in this situation. They have no sound boards in any of their fitness studios so the sound goes right through the walls. The Yoga studio is directly next to the Cycling studio. Cycling music way too loud and bass booming coming through the walls while you're trying to teach a meditative flowing Yoga class. You'll end up with little to no students then you won't get paid because you have no students show up to your class.\r\n6. Overall the management is very unprofessional and most of them have little experience working in an actual fitness facility. Most of them were nurses or Les Mills instructors before they got into management, or someone's best friend or relative. Yes, there's a lot of that there too. They will hire their best friend or relatives left and right but not someone who is actually qualified for the position."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Registered Nurse", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 May 2018", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Thibodaux, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people to work with!
