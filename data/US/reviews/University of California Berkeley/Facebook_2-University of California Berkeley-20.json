A postdoc is a short term appointment to do research, publish a few papers and in parallel, perform a professional career development tasks including fellowship programs, referee for journals and conference committees and contribute in external research funding. This short term career development cannot be organized properly if pushing >60 hours/week to do only research. This school is an improper place for doing postdoc but excellent for doing undergraduate/graduate studies. In addition, it is not recommended to work for young advisers as a postdoc at UC Berkeley. Sometimes, they can simply impose conflict of interest or competence to postdocs and the school does not have proper platforms to provide professional solutions to help postdocs to develop their short term career properly and at least, join another group. The university staff (advisers, organizers, etc.) do not have proper leadership and organization skills. They require to attend several workshops to gain skills and experiences on proper project organization, management and handling basic conflicts in the work area. If looking for a place to develop an excellent academic postdoc in the Bay area without observing such organization troubles, it might be better to consider Stanford University."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good experience as a Tutor", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Statistics and Economics Tutor in Berkeley, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "As a tutor you will have a very flexible schedule, you can choose your own hours.
