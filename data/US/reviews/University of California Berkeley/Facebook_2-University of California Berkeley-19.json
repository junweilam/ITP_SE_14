However, they're getting a degree because they want to be mentored in the techniques/topics of the field. They go to grad school to learn how to do research - not because they're already experts. \r\n\r\nThe Berkeley Psych program suffers first from inconsistency in mentors. Some are awesome and some are horrifyingly bad (even, in my opinion, abusive of their students). This could be countered by having a strong support system for students, good course offerings (especially statistical/technical training), clear milestones students must achieve to progress to their PhD, and pressure on mentors to actively encourage the progress of their students.\r\n\r\nGraduate support, in spite of efforts on the part of some nifty faculty, remained inconsistent as of Fall 2012. This was hampered in part by continuous turnover in our support staff. The end result, however, is that there isn't really a strong community in place advocating on behalf of the psych grad students or providing resources to guide them.\r\n\r\nStatistical/technical training is shallow, lasting only the first year and focusing on only the most general frequentist techniques (unless you happen to have an advisor willing to mentor you in techniques more specific to your own research).\r\n\r\nThere is a milestones document but (1) it has been revised often enough that it's confusing as to what it's in it and (2) mentors are inconsistent about their opinion of it. Some ignore it almost entirely while others help students build and stick to plans to follow it. \r\n\r\nIn other words, mentors don't really appear to receive much feedback based on student performance. If a student gets lost in the cracks - or even if several do - then it's on the students. This makes the motivation low for mentors to actively help students plan for and progress towards milestones. This is not that unreasonable given that mentors are busy faculty with active research programs, teaching loads, and their own personal lives but disappointing if you're a bewildered graduate student.\r\n\r\nI can't personally recommend the Berkeley Psychology department as a good place to be a graduate student.
