It's just sad, though, when you walk into a building that has a huge banner reading \"ranked 89th best school of education\".  Is that really banner worthy? How about spending that banner money on education so UC can climb to 88th...\r\n\r\nMy nightmare has largely been due to problems in my local unit. Other units are not so dysfunctional.

My direct supervisor has proven to be spineless, incompetent, and capable of lying.  His supervisor is tyrannical, dishonest, can't admit mistakes, and believes that she is the be all, know all of everything every where.  Management constantly tries to \"tighten the screws\" on the staff, a staff who's work has repeatedly, during state inspections, been giving glowing reviews, and has been noted by a VP that there have never been any complaints made on my department while out in the field.  Manaegment has had several grievances filed on them just in the last few months by a relatively small staff of about 12, and management continues to challenge Unions and university policy to negatively effect working conditions and to try and take away the compensation provide by union contracts.  When problems continued, I was advised to \"Look for a new job, if its that bad\" by the VP of research instead of being offered a solution.  Management has zero accountability within my department, and no one ranked above shows any signs of concern.  At one point, it was rumored that 3 staff members were going to potentially go on a killing spree and management did nothing to follow this up nor show concern of this notion.  The excuse was that the \"rumor\" could not be substantiated.  None of the workers were worried, but that is how management handles things, by not handling them and then making up excuses or out right lies to cover themselves.  Another incident, was during a holiday party where the top supervisor in my department said that \"they stopped playing a certain game because the foreigners didn't understand\"....not a big deal, but with 2 international employees sitting in the room, it seemed rather crass, rude, and discriminatory coming from a supervisor making $123,000 a year and working for a university that boasts diversity and equal oppurtunity.  The list goes on.  Supervisors approve time off work only to take it back because they made a mistake.  Supervisors deny time off and refuse to approve it unless intimate details are provided surrounding the need for time off.  The most the university has done was require that the supervisors go to training, one in which the top supervisor was the trainer.  How on earth can someone who is the cause of the problem, be able to solve the problem.  Tyranny, incompetence, and dusting things under the rug has been the university's solution to handling the intense problems my department has been struggling to right.
