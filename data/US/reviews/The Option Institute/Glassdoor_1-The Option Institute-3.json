This was probably the longest doctor visit of our lives and it went soooo amazing. My son was sweet and curious. He asked lots of questions to the doctors and even got to listen to his own heart beat for being so well behaved. The doctors were so impressed by his behavior and maturity level. My son had such a great attitude\u2014in lulls of the appointment when I had to fill out paper work (it was our first time doing a physical there) he was just sooo pleasant. We giggled and talked about the fish in the waiting room and Jacob showed me some of his latest dance moves\u2014it was the best morning. \r\nWhen it came time to get the shot I was so excited at how cool and collective my son remained. \u201cIt just a little pinch, no big deal\u201d, he said as he rolled up his sleeve. (Rewind back a year or two and this kid would start screaming just at the word shot). I held his hand as he got his shot and he laughed when it was done and shared one of his stickers with me. \r\nAll this to say, I am sooo soo thankful for all your love and guidance.
