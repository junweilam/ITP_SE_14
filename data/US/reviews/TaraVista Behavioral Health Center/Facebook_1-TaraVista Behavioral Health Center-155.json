We had almost all previous nursing supervisors leave along with constant revolving HR representatives since none of them stayed for more than a month. As if working in a psych ward isn't mentally draining as is - management and higher ups made it so much worse and it continues to get worse. HR consistently blames staff for every rising problem. For example, there were lots of safety concerns regarding patient to staffing ratio and MULTIPLE restraints a day by a single patient who was assaulting and sending MULTIPLE staff members to the hospital daily. DMH received a call from numerous staff members telling them about the acuity and how unsafe it was for staff let alone patients. Unbelievably (I wish I could attach this email), HR sent out a hospital-wide email claiming that all problems are at fault of MHCS and \"our attitudes\" which in turn are effecting the patients. From mental health counselor stand point something I that does not sit right with me is the constant reminder that we are not actual counselors at all, in other words they basically just reminded us that we are basically babysitters nothing more. Nothing more until all the group counselor quit and MHCs were expected to take on the role of someone who makes over 80,000 a year on a $18 salary.

The first is the pay is far from what it should be, secretary's get paid more than counselors. Benefits are terrible, for a hospital, the quality of the insurance is lousy. \r\n\r\nStaff to patient ratio is very unrealistic, the department that reviews and accepts patients consists of non clinical staff who are not qualified to determine whether or not a patient is a suitable admission. They scan referrals and somehow overlook drug seeking patients, violent patients, patients who have been in-patient at TV before and were not appropriate then. This shows the staff that you don't care about them, or their safety. I should have known staff safety wasn't a priority when they decided to get rid of security. They take so many patients who are admitted on Suboxone and Methadone, patients who are withdrawing and demanding meds are not suitable for the units, especially when they are already highly acute. \r\n\r\nI think it had great potential when it opened, but I truly believe that the vision is so far from what they say it is. I worked tirelessly, trying to always make a difference, I was a great employee and was treated terribly. They do not like when you speak up, it doesn't matter what the issue is, it's frowned upon. When real reviews come in and they are negative, they are met with the standard reply from HR that they value their employees and to call them if you want to talk further. They solicit staff to write reviews which are fed through HR and submitted as \"verified employee\" and this happens when there have been a lot of negative reviews. A good example would be the 20 reviews posted the last week of September and the first week of October on another popular review site. I believe this is an attempt to bury the negatives and prospective employees scan a dozen or so and only see the solicited reviews. When reviews point out issues and are 100% true, the company will flag it and request it be removed. \r\n\r\nIt bothers me that in this day and age a company can be so dismissive towards staff concerns. Once you began feeling unsafe and under valued, it's time to move on. If people take the time to look at all the reviews available through a web search you will see a common theme and that is management treats the staff terribly and complaining won't get you anywhere, you will learn fast that you are replaceable and that your feelings, no matter how justified do not matter."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Be wary.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Mental Health Counselor in Devens, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful facility. \r\n\r\nThey hire some truly amazing and dedicated individuals and the nursing managers do try to make you feel as comfortable as possible in terms of schedule. \r\n\r\nLunches are delicious.", "cons": "It is a business at the end of the day.

Dont believe them when they say they welcome feedback and wish employees who've posted on this site had come to them. Its not true. We all voice our concerns in staff meetings, and emails. We ask for support and better screenings. We ask for materials to work with our patients all the time. We send work orders for repairs to our units, and write requests for additional and appropriate staffing all the time. You have to be careful. Speaking up and disagreeing puts a target on your back. Those who have, have been pushed out or fired under suspicious circumstances.  We've lost so many key people, so many good people.  The Human resource department should be the department you can go to for assistance,  but here it has become an extension of the CNOs voice.
