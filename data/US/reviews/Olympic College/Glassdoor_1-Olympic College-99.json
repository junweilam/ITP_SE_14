Good food at the cafeteria.\r\nA lot employees want to help and work with you to solve problems\r\nCan be a well oiled machine depending on who you work with\r\nI had a good team of people for the first 2 years that I worked with. I made some good friendships and felt apart of a work family for the first time ever.", "cons": "There are a lot of people in positions of power and/or who have seniority who do absolutely nothing, push all of their responsibilities on their assistants/other coworkers, understaff their departments, and use bureaucracy as excuses to not improve student and employee lives. I have personally been verbally abused and mistreated by people like this within the institute, with other employees telling me to not get on their bad side because \"they have seniority\", insinuating they will use their position of perceived power to make my job a living h---, which they did.\r\n\r\nThey will promise to give you full time employment but they will never deliver - ever. Unless you apply for another position within the college, you will not get full time. I was promised full time for 3 years - nada, and no raise either. \r\n\r\nYou will never get a raise. They will make excuses as to why you will never get one. You can out perform everyone else on your team or do more than what is expected time and time again, you will never get a raise.\r\n\r\nIf the minimum wage increases, your wages will not. Your position could pay $5 over minimum wage, but if the minimum wage goes up, you're pay will stay the same. Basically, you're getting a pay cut. You bring this up and they will say they won't change anything.\r\n\r\nThey are not transparent publicly about their employment stats. A vast majority (over 60%) of the people employed through Olympic College are part time and, once again, they do not make part timers to full timers ever. \r\n\r\nProductivity comes second to out-dated professionalism practices.\r\n\r\nExample 1. You are not allowed to close your office door. This may be different for different departments, but in the one I worked in if I had my door slightly ajar or straight up closed, I would get in trouble. I can get overwhelmed by stimuli often and my office was frequently loud and full of people talking super loudly or even straight up yelling, which would distract me from my work. I explained that I needed to close my door in order to focus and I was told I could not. If I wore headphones, it was tolerated but sometimes they would comment on how inconvenient that is for them. I would be ignored for several hours every day, no one checking on me or anything, but the moment my door was even slightly closed suddenly management would be at my door telling me not to do that. I would have a coworker screaming into their phone in their office next door to me, absolutely driving me mad and distracting me from my work, but if I closed my door to dry to separate myself from it or if I asked them to stop yelling, I would be yelled at by management. Ridiculous. \r\n\r\nExample 2. If you are even slightly curt in an email chain towards someone who is being purposefully obtuse in their role, everyone will be mad at you for calling the BS out rather than being mad at the person who is intentionally standing in the way of institutional effectiveness. People who are purposefully obtuse in their positions are even defended by other employees even though those employees also hate their behavior! But I guess rocking the boat is worse than trying to make any long lasting changes systemically.\r\n\r\nI worked at OC for 3 years. By the time I left, all of the coworkers I had started with and loved were gone (driven away, frankly).
