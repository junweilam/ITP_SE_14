When interviewing and beginning, everything seems professional and business as usual. However, once you are past the initial training, everything changes. Immediately you are expected and demanded to bring in countless students and enroll them the same day you meet with them. Take into account that you are expected to produce your own \"leads\" or people gullible enough to come in and sign up. The list of names and numbers they give you are not even those who have ever heard of the school, they're from a paid marketing list. If feeling like a sleezy salesman for a less than subpar school is for you, then you will do well. Everyone is a one man show, doing anything and everything to make themselves look good and you look terrible. People are nice to you when you are talking face to face, but thanks to the paper thin walls, it's not hard to figure out what is being said behind your back. More times than not, it's untruthful. The tuition for this school is priced as though it offers a genuine bachelor's degree program, but it's certificates and an associates from a school that's been around for decades, but still no one knows about it. For good reason. The students they recruit are people who have never gone to college before or did not do well in school the first time around. It's more like preying upon vulnerable people who are about to sign up for thousands of dollars of student debt to work at a dead end job because the classes are taught by teachers who show up hung over from the night before. It's a joke. The management is unprofessional. There is no growth or development at this place. There is no support from anyone, because everyone is too busy watching their own back. The president is uninspiring at best, though morally corrupt and a bully at worst. The hours are long and every Friday you are called into a virtual meeting to sit around and hear about how much you suck at your job and it's all your fault that you suck.

Demands may be rigorously imposed but leads to retained staff and faculty who care supremely about what they do. Proper tools are available to allow faculty/staff to give their best. Unlike public education, the President/CEO demands excellence and roots out those who do not achieve in the areas that maximize student achievement. Public education tends to allow mediocrity in its faculty. ICT does not. Public education gives mediocrity to the masses. ICT gives students to instructors in manageable class sizes, allowing for individualization to student needs and learning styles. Graduation from ICT translates into success for students who take the opportunity to stay invested in their educational experience. ICT is a \"tried-and-true\" product of an educational environment that for the most part has gone astray of practical principles and processes. We need more of this type of educational setting in private education. Truly a breath of fresh air from the private educational companies that never prove their worth in the marketplace, succumbing to failed policies and corrupt practices. What speaks the loudest regarding ICT is the U.S. Department of Education's ranking of ICT consistently in the top 20 of two-year private colleges in the country for value to the student. Disgruntled employees come and go, but the foundational cornerstones of ICT, Quality, Service and Commitment, insure the very best educational opportunity for the student.

More than likely your duties will include more than what you initially believe them to be and you will be doing yourself what would normally be done by two or three people. You *have* to be willing to roll up your sleeves and do whatever is necessary to get the job done. Students aren't coming to class? Call them up. Students having an issue that they believe requires them to withdraw? Be prepared to help them through it. Be ready to bring your own material if you need something for a lesson and the department can't procure what you need beforehand. For some, this isn't an issue as this is exactly what they want to do. For others, it may be a non-starter.\r\n\r\nTHERE IS NO DEDICATED STUDENT RETENTION TEAM (as of the time of my review). Yes, there are \"advisors\" but [a] only ESL has a \"team\" of advisors, and [b] for occupational students the administration of the department is the advisor, which can total in some departments over a hundred students. The instructors and Department Chairs/DoE/Campus Director *is* the retention team. Instructors are reviewed on success rates and participation rates; if a student isn't coming to class, then that hurts the instructor's rates and they are impacted accordingly (this is regardless of whether or not the absences are justified). The administration can do nothing to help their instructors with this, as well. ICT is a non-attendance taking institution; instead, it runs on \"participation\". This means that if a student is censused, the instructor and department administration \"owns the student\" until the end of the semester and the student cannot be withdrawn if they stop coming to class and cut off all communication. This hurts the instructor, this hurts the administration, this hurts the student since it impacts their GPA as well as monetarily if they are receiving Title-IV, and it hurts the reputation of the school.\r\n\r\nAll the stress, pressure to achieve numbers, and duties upon duties upon duties fosters a toxic environment which isn't healthy in the long term. You need to be aware of this going in. There will be talk about things being put into action, groups being put together to achieve certain goals, and then they will just fizzle out with nothing proceeding.

I remember speaking to an ESL program coordinator of a local university and she compared ICT to a sweatshop when I told her about the amount of work I was expected to do in a 40/hr work week. She actually advised me to only work at ICT for a year maximum and then move on to somewhere else. Education is not the priority here and teachers are neither valued nor appreciated for their work but rather viewed as disposable. Every few months or so, teachers receive a performance evaluation in which a manager sits in and observes their class. However, having an excellent performance evaluation means little or nothing to the dean and the president as all they care about is retention and money. You can't believe anything that administration tells you. They'll tell you that you're doing a great job one day and the very next day they'll let you go. \r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no training for new teachers. They are literally just thrown into a classroom with no idea on what block they are teaching or how to operate programs on the computer. This, in turn, makes new teachers look incompetent and unprepared. \r\n\r\nICT also does a terrible job of screening students. They admit students who are probably illiterate in their own language which is completely unfair to both the teacher and the student. Moreover, managers and teachers are forced to compromise grades so that the students, even the illiterate ones, will stay and move up to the next level. Talk about a lack of moral and ethical conduct.\r\n\r\nOn top of all of this, the program is set up like a revolving door. Here's how it works: \r\n\r\nEach semester is made up of three 5-week sessions or \"blocks\" (Block A, B and C). Block A, of course, being the easiest of the semester as it covers the language basics and Block C being the hardest as it's \"somewhat\" a combination of everything taught in Block A and B. The school admits new students every 5 weeks, so many students do not start in Block A. Do these students have a hard time grasping the material? Absolutely. Do they constantly ask the teacher why they are not starting with basics like the ABC's? Absolutely. Are the teachers blamed when these students find the material incomprehensible and decide not to come back? Absolutely. Does the school do this solely for monetary gain? Absolutely.\r\n\r\nEvery way in which this company operates tells students and employees that the only value here is money.
