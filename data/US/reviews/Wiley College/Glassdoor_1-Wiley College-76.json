A lot of mails get lost or never reached intended faculty\r\n* It is ok for students not attending class, but still manage to pass the class just by taking one exam at the end. If faculty won't allow this, the VP for Academic Affairs will press him/her to do it.\r\n* A lot of bullshits, a VP for Academic Affairs talked a lot of BS, even saying he will hold this college against any university in the US, even Standford or Harvard :D\r\n* Poor technology support. Example: computer labs were equipped with 5-year-old or older computers. Some are not even working while the others take forever to boot up.\r\n* They called the College President the CEO :D\r\n* They were in financial trouble, so that they asked faculty for mandatory donation\r\n* To many prayers, each time we have any kind of meeting. But probably nobody prays to make this college a better place :D\r\n* They come up with a BS idea \"Communicating through Debate\" :D\r\n* The salary is very low, a lot of faculty gets $30,000's or lower $40,000's. Rarely anyone gets above $50,000.\r\n* Too many people in the cabinet of the president. It seems they use cabinet positions as way to employ some of their unemployed friends (wasting a lot of money)\r\n* No quality control. Faculty can teach any material or not teaching at all\r\n* Academic departments do not have any control over online courses, since those courses are managed by a person (with hot connection to one member of the cabinet) outside the department. And since teaching those online courses will bring extra income to someone, this person just assign the teaching to herself or her friends, regardless whether they are competent in those fields. \r\n* Too many turn-over. Once you experience the culture of administrator and students there, you really want to get out immediately. \r\n* A lot of students do not fit for college (behavior and / or skills, e.g., reading skills, math skills etc.)"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not an institution of higher learning", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Oct 2013", "job_title": "Professor in Marshall, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small campus, great town, lots of great history", "cons": "This is the least professional place I have ever worked. Power is centralized in a small number of VPs that are tasked to perform a variety of tasks that would normally be rolled into lower functionaries. Example: dorm rules violations are adjudicated by a VP as the first level of response. They then use this power as a reason to micro-manage every aspect of employee life, filling it with useless meetings and reports. \r\n\r\nThe school is so poorly run and desperate for money that they admit any applicant, and enrollment continues through the 12th class day. Effectively, this means that classes don't begin until the third week, and many students choose not to show up until that point. \r\n\r\nAcademic standards don't exist. There is an internal policy that students should be administratively dropped after six absences in a given class, but the administration is so worried about getting the federal financial aid from those students that they prevent faculty from enforcing in. The same is true for academic integrity. Many students complete none of their assignments during the semester, then ask to complete them all immediately before finals. Professors generally allow them to, because the administration makes it clear that student failure is the fault of the professor. \r\n\r\nThis campus culture is broken. Lack of punctuality is rampant, with most students (those that attend at all) not showing up at the designated beginning of class. In 50-minute MWF classes, I have personally witnessed, time and again, students arriving at the 30-minute mark. Although the administration seems to generally disapprove, their position is that those students should still be allowed in \"so every student can succeed.\" That is, unless they are wearing a hat, sagging, or doing anything else to violate one of the signs posted about how a \"Wiley Man\" comports himself. Sagging is definitely an offense that mandates removal from class."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Okay place to work if you can\u2019t find anything else", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Supplemental Instruction Leader in Marshall, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Laidback work environment with usually fun coworkers", "cons": "Disrespectful administration that only updates you last minute.
