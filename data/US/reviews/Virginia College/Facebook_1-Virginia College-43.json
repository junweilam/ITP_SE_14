However, I would say in many instances this focus on profit does bring a focus back on the customer (in this case the student) so that satisfaction is ensured. The mandatory company goal of exceeding it's accreditor's 60% compliance metric in employment placement to instead focus on a goal of meeting a 72% placement rate, definitely operates as a check and balance that the customer (student) is getting what they're paying out the nose for.

Due to (apparent) pressure on enrollment to meet quotas, students who lack basic literacy skills are enrolled and placed in programs where their ultimate chances for success are bleak. \r\n4.  In programs with large female populations such as medical assisting and surg tech, the high rate of student pregnancy necessarily impacts attendance in those programs. When an instructors attendance drops to 85% they are written up, counseled, and placed on an improvement plan. A few quarters ago I had a class with 10 students, all female, two of whom were placed on bed rest the last 4-5 weeks of the quarter due to pregnancy complications. As such I had to develop an instructor improvement plan to improve my attendance. I've been there almost two years and I've had perhaps only 5 male students. Instructors should not be penalized for the reproductive habits of the students."

Also, the company is highly disorganized. Corporate makes sporadic decisions and then changes them over and over again. If anything goes wrong then it is the Planners fault.  The company is highly blameful. The most harmful quick decision was a system change that affected requesting funds for students. They hastily stopped using a certain company due to bad business relations. Some student's funds could not be requested in the time frame allotted and again, it was the Planner's fault. Lastly, but certainly not least, the school is predatory. Their target market is Black females. They offer degrees and certifications at ridiculous prices. A community college would charge around $2100 for certain certificates, VC charges $22,000 for the same certificate. This is the subprime market for education, for-profit schools."

The students should have been required to fill out the same questionnaire describing what they did to make me want to return to class. The students were very immature, and I was constantly handling behavioral issues that should have been handled in kindergarten. I resigned because I no longer felt safe. The last term I worked there, I had to call security three times. One of those times, the school called the police and two of my students were arrested for fighting in class. I would advise any instructor who is considering working there to get self-defense training first."

You work with great students who have goals however with such big course loads and such little time to work with or even meet with any of your students faculty members, specifically part time do not even have a place to meet with or provide counsel for students. The money making philosophy allows for classrooms to be vacated ASAP after class to prepare for an incoming instructors and therefore if a student from the class needs help or has questions, as an adjunct, you must talk with your students as you walk down the hall to the next class. The school is modeled to place numbers ahead of student needs. They also retain students who should be dropped for missing so many classes unexcused just to maintain their retention numbers. It looks good on the bottom line however it is bad practice to have a rule in place and in turn have faculty scolded when the students fails in the end. This school is all about numbers and the bottom line. Many of the instructors are hired at the last moment to teach and many have no previous teaching experience. They must hire this way in that the faculty turnover rate at the college is extremely high, good instructors do not stay. There  is a great deal of pressure placed on faculty members each when student drops or have absences from class, no matter what the reason for the absence or drop. There is also so much work that must be done outside the classroom for part time faculty, it really amounts to full time work plus, and the pay for part time in no way compensates part time faculty who must work over weekends and late most nights to go home grade papers and prepare for classes, the pay is poor, below minimum wage for the amount of work that has to be done outside the classroom to include reports."

Taking registrars off campus and replacing them with incompetent staff at corporate, and taking a program and placing it under the supervision of someone that does not have the credentials.. This is for the betterment of the student. Maybe those that sit in the Ivory tower known as ECA should get off their rear ends drive to a campus and find out what really happens at a school. One quarter tuition goes up the next quarter it goes down.. These are human beings that pay your salary...quit treating them as if they were chips in sodas. ECA managers have never set foot in school they all came from the chips and soda factories. Management at the local campus will lie to the students and employees. With so much change for the students each and every day it's a wonder the schools stay open. Students are forced to take online classes because the dean forces PRogram directors to cancel classes. Dean even went so far as to ask one PD to offer a class to new students in the directed study format just to meet a section bidet. This is against policy. They allow students to enroll that cannot read and can barely write. Adjunct instructors get paid 1200-1500 per class but are forced to put more than 40 hours a week into a class. If the Dean and president do not like an instructor even though they are a good instructor, they will find a way to get rid of them. Dean and president talks about instructors inability to teach even though neither have set foot in the classroom. PD are forced to work more than 40 hours a week, and are expected to teach a minimum of three classes...sometimes more. I would not recommend this company to Satan."

You will be given a budget that is completely unreasonable, and you will most likely have a guilty conscience when you enroll citizens who have no business in higher education, and now as students, they will most likely not complete the degree and be saddled with extreme debt. Few programs at the college are a good investment (culinary, nursing, respiratory tech,  and ultrasound seem to be the only exceptions, and are still expensive). If you decided to accept this job, be warned. To meet your budget, you will have to live your job, be passing out cards on your off time, and constantly stressing. Then when you do earn your promotions and move up, you will find a point where the budget is too high and the company will let you go. In my 4 months there, I believe our Admissions department of roughly 20 saw about half the staff get fired or leave willingly, and as I left, more were also on their way out."

In practice, the primary goal is \"numbers\". It is difficult for the company to balance its demand for revenue with its desire to \"transform lives\".  Admissions reps are encouraged to get only quality applicants, but are berated for not having enough students enrolled. This unfortunately leads admissions reps to adopt questionable admissions practices, including lying and enrolling unqualified students. \r\nThe school where I worked was located in an impoverished community. The lure of stipends was very enticing to potential students. Some students admittedly only attended to receive what little loan money was left over after paying for their tuition. This is an area of great concern. The students that do graduate with a certificate or an associate degree (as many do not) can expect to have approximately $20k in loan debt and a low wage job. \r\nTuition is excessive, but this is due in part to the amount of staff required to create an extremely personalized (to the point of coddling) experience for the students. Setting the tone, admissions contacts a prospective student multiple times a day for several days if she misses an appointment. If her financial aid on hold she is called and emailed repeatedly and if this fails she is escorted from her class to the financial aid office to take care of her responsibilities. Every time a student misses a class she is called. This technique may be effective initially to demonstrate concern and provide encouragement especially to those who haven\u2019t had the benefit of a nurturing home life. But here the student is never allowed to show initiative or be self-reliant which is detrimental to development and future career prospects. Virginia College\u2019s mission is sound, but its practices are injurious to the students it claims to put first."
