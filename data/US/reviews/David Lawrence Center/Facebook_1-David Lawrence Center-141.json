David Lawrence Center is a non-profit, mental health and substance abuse treatment center that serves Collier County. We serve everyone in the community, from the insured and well to do, to those that have literally no where else to go. The entire County benefits from the work we do, not just the clients we see, and it is very satisfying to work for an organization that makes such a positive impact in the community. Yes, because we are a non-profit, we have to run lean. We depend on state, federal, and local grants, in addition to private donations to fund our operations, and those sources (particularly government sources) impose requirements that make work here a little more difficult than at our for-profit counterparts. We have to do more with less, and we owe it to the taxpayers and donors to serve our community as efficiently and effectively as possible, which is no easy task. But the people here, the ones that are in it for the long haul, really care about their clients and the community. \r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my second pro: the leadership. From the top down, the culture of DLC is one of compassion and empathy for our clients and staff. I have personally witnessed board and exec team members going to bat for our clients and staff, like fighting to preserve benefits when it comes to budgeting, or going the extra mile to secure funding for a critical community need. None of the executives or directors are working cushy bankers' hours. They are committed and work extremely hard to fulfill the mission of the organization. If you care and are committed to serving the community, the leadership here will fully support you.\r\n\r\nThere are many other pros, but the two I mentioned are the ones that stick out most to me, especially when considered against my previous experiences in the for-profit world.", "cons": "As mentioned above, we do have to do more with less. Because of our funding sources, sometimes it means extra reporting, or more rigorous productivity requirements. But it is doable, and all the necessary tools to get the job done are provided, including training, supplies, staff support, etc. We all have to work hard, and if you're looking for a job where you can browse social media or watch YouTube videos to kill the time, this is definitely not the place for you.
