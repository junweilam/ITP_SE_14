I personally saw many hiring managers take a chance on a hire who ended up doing great work even though they may not have been the most qualified candidate on paper. This also means that there can be chances for quick advancement for those who do good work or are otherwise recognized somehow. I\u2019ve seen many entry level hires gain a tremendous amount of work experience at Moody and move on to do great things at other organizations.\r\n\r\nMoody also has a few genuinely wonderful people who work hard to make sure that the people on their teams are well cared for. These people do good work and are focused on achieving the goals of the organization. Working with or under one of these people can make working at Moody a great experience.", "cons": "Moody is overall a very dysfunctional place. \r\n\r\nSalaries and benefits are far below market rates depending on your department and job function. Moody tends to hire desperate former students at extremely low salaries. \r\n\r\nThere is widespread financial mismanagement (I was told to spend as much as I could on my corporate card because it got Moody extra cash back). At one point an employee bragged to me about how much money (approximately 40k) they spent on a piece of equipment which at the time of my departure from employment at Moody had been sitting, unused, for over 3 years. This employee also lectured me multiple times about \u201cspending donor dollars wisely\u201d.\r\n\r\nSenior leadership (specifically institute president Mark Jobe) actively and repeatedly tells employees to leave if they aren\u2019t willing to put their heads down and deal with the fact that working at a ministry requires more sacrifice (financial and time) than working at a normal organization. At the same time, they speak at great length about the financial successes the institute has experienced (this was said in multiple employee town hall meetings). There is a fundamental disconnect between upper management and individual contributors. My observation is that approximately 20% of the employees (particularly student and part time employees, who are not eligible for benefits) at Moody do around 80-90% of the work, while many full-time employees show up for a few hours each day, look busy, and simply leave without having done any real work.\r\n\r\nMany employees lack basic social skills and appropriate workplace behavior. I\u2019ve had to insist that colleagues stop touching me (after they couldn\u2019t pick up on the fact that I was obviously uncomfortable with their touch, never mind that they shouldn\u2019t have acted that way in the first place). Beyond this, many employees simply don\u2019t exhibit ideal hygiene for an office environment, especially during a global pandemic. I\u2019ve observed several colleagues clipping nails in shared spaces, refusing to wear masks even when required to by company, city, and state guidelines, and more. HR chooses not to engage in these conversations, asserting that it is up to individual managers to control this type of behavior. \r\n\r\nThere is blatant favoritism shown in many departments. Certain employees have the ear of executives and manage to get what they want, even when it\u2019s demonstrably bad for the organization or for other employees. This almost exclusively benefits older employees, especially those who are white and male. For example, I personally have seen countless younger employees, employees of color and female employees moved from offices to far less desirable cubicle spaces in favor of older, whiter, or male employees, even when the employees moved had far more reason to have an office\r\n\r\nThe annual review system is deeply flawed. Rather than having objective standards (or even standard training for managers), each manager is left to determine their own qualifiers for whether their direct reports have achieved their goals for the review period. This allows managers to treat their direct reports with as much or as little favoritism as they choose, leading to high scores for the direct reports they like and are friends with, and low scores for those they are not friends with. Coupled with aggressive evangelical superiority complexes, this is incredibly toxic for employees who have different opinions than their managers. \r\n\r\nManagement frequently fails to listen to advice and input from qualified employees when that advice isn\u2019t what they want to hear. At one point I implemented a new policy within the scope of my role and authority, only to have a counterpart of mine instruct their entire team to disregard said policy and continue doing what they\u2019d always done. When I raised this to management above me, they ignored me and allowed my counterpart to continue in their ways.\r\n\r\nMy overall experience with Moody is that they are very comfortable skirting the line of questionably legal actions which are certainly unethical. For example, when I departed Moody, my manager failed to inform HR of my departure until after I\u2019d left. As a result, my final paycheck was incorrect, and did not reflect the vacation payout I was owed. That paycheck arrived over two months late. Illinois law requires that final pay arrives no more than 1 pay period after departure. When I highlighted this fact, I was informed of my former manager\u2019s failure to notify HR with no other excuse or explanation. Similarly, I\u2019m aware of managers who have illegally shifted part time hours from one pay period to another to avoid paying overtime, and while the official HR policy prohibits this behavior, it is still rampant and to my knowledge, not addressed."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "adjuct professor", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Jul 2022", "job_title": "French Adjunct Professor in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I loved my students and coworker.

For months, I engaged with management and upper level people to talk about and address the issues. I was told things were going to change and they were working on it. This never happened. My time at Moody culminated with me getting stabbed in the back once more, me losing my cool in a meeting (for the first time), and being told that I don't know what I am talking about because I am young and don't deserve respect. I was also required to work over holidays and vacation because of lack of communication and lack of respect. When I returned in the new year, I was let go without explanation. When asking for explanation, I was not given any and told by HR that they didn't really know. The only thing I do know was that I was very open with my supervisor about mental health struggles I was having and was told in my termination meeting that it was partially due to my mental health that I was let go.

If you're VERY interested in working at an old-school non-profit Christian organization, you would probably be okay with working at Moody. \r\n\r\n- Family. It's not a bad place to work if you have a family, there are plenty of holidays, vacation compensation isn't terrible (10 business days to start, and you get more after 5, 10 and 20 years [or so] at the company) and flex hours are good. It's also friendly if you want to bring your wife and kids around on occasion. \r\n\r\n- Mentorship. Moody has some great people who work there. In my time there I was able to have several people I considered mentors who helped me develop as a professional and personally. \r\n\r\n- Gym. Moody has a nice gym, guys play basketball regularly over lunch. There's a decent weight room and cardio room, and a track for running. \r\n\r\n- Snacks. There's generally quite a few snacks around, not counting the cafeteria that employees can get food from for breakfast and lunch. \r\n\r\n- Accessibility. There's decent parking, and plenty of public transit close by. As an employee, if there's something you want to do downtown, it's really great to park at Moody and walk to most places.", "cons": "Since this is the area that most people will read closely, I want to mention that I will try to be as objective as I can. Please understand that I without hesitation would say that I consider it an overall terrible place to work as a younger professional. \r\n\r\n- Dead end to careers. If you have any ideas of moving up the career ladder at Moody, you will be extremely disappointed. There have been people who have worked at Moody for 20, 30, even 40 years, so positions rarely open for advancement. To be honest, Moody isn't exactly growing either, so there aren't a ton of new positions from a growth perspective opening up. \r\n\r\n- Promotions/Advancement don't happen. In my time at Moody I saw this happen to multiple people in multiple roles: A position would open up, someone in the department who has worked there for xx years and knows the system applies for the job. They interview, go through the steps (usually, they are also handling the responsibilities of the position that opened up), and then they are passed over for someone from another department (happened 1+ times) or hire someone from outside the company (happened 3+ times).  In each case I can know of, the department suffered in some way. In two of the cases where someone was hired from outside the company, they were later let go for various reasons, mainly because they didn't fit the culture. \r\n\r\n- Management doesn't care. There was one situation particularly that I'm aware of where a department was struggling with a new hire just not getting along with their coworkers. Folks from that department went to HR on multiple occasions. When HR finally took action, someone asked \"If in 3-6 months nothing changes and these concerns are still on going, what happens?\" To which the response was \"Nothing would happen, this should solve the issue.\" (Last I heard, every one of the employees in that department left the organization or moved to new departments eventually). Managers often handle stuff very secretly, and give no warning and ask for no input before making sweeping changes. Employees are expected to just go along with it, and anyone who questions it get reprimanded (in the most Christianese way)\r\n\r\n- \"Leadership\" summit. While working at Moody, I had the opportunity to attend the global leadership summit. I absolutely loved the experience, and Moody had a large investment in it. However, I was also amazed how so many of the points of the leadership summit went completely in one ear and out the other of management. Statements like \"If you move a manager into a high-performing department, and that department suddenly starts struggling, it's not the team's fault\" seemed to fall on deaf ears.  I had a co-worker who on a regular basis would come back to the office and sit at their desk distraught with how poorly they were treated by our manager, often tearing up and had enough emotional stress it resulted in ultimately leaving Moody. \r\n\r\n- Fake Christianity. I do not mean that people there are not Christians, I mean it to mean that they are the move over-the-top Christians there are. The best explanation that I can think of is go look up Michael Jr's \"Over Saved\" video. While he means it as satire, there are entire departments at Moody I interacted with that were like that. While it might seem funny, it get's old really fast when you are struggling through something and someone looks you dead in the eye and says  \"Sounds like you might just need to get right with the Lord, and confess your sin.\"\r\n\r\n- Terrible pay. I want to break this down because this has more meaning behind it than just money. First off, Moody is based in downtown Chicago. The average price for a 1 bedroom apartment in downtown is something like $1600 a month. So it takes almost $20k/yr just to make rental payments. That doesn't count food, transportation, bills, or uncovered medial payments. For a young single man or woman, living on a >$40k per year salary is possible, as long as you don't have any major surprise payments, don't want to do anything except an occasional movie, try to date, and go on vacation anywhere but your parent's house. \"Oh, but I could live in the suburbs.\" Yeah ok, if you want to spend at least 2-3 hours per day commuting. At one point during a celebration for someone who had worked at the company for ~30 years (whose spouse commuted with them and also worked downtown), was calculating how long they had commuted together in YEARS spent in the car.  \r\n\r\n- Millennials? As a millennial myself, this was a direct impact. Moody is a revolving door for young talent.  There was no hope for a career, pay far below what peers made at other companies, and an inability to have any input or make any real difference in the company. There's also considerations like \"maternity leave\" that in my opinion should be a no-brainer for a Christian organization...but no, a young mother needs to use all vacation, personal time, and then go without pay for having a child. I could go on much longer about the issues that I faced, but I don't want to give more details. \r\n\r\nOverall, while some of the people are really amazing to get to know, the culture and way things are handled are not Christ-honoring. If you follow every rule, and are an uptight Christian, it's the perfect place for you. If you're an honest person who likes transparency, opportunities, and likes feeling valued, McDonalds (or anywhere else) would be a better starting point."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Disfunction at All Levels", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Manager in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The community of co-workers is often strong.

I received 401-3b package with Moody matching up to 3%, as well as a pension that was 4% of my salary. They have health, dental, vision, AD&D, and disability insurance.", "cons": "Where to begin? Moody sets itself up as being a place that is devoted to spreading the truth of the gospel to as many people as possible. They do this through multiple ministries under the banner of \"Moody Global Ministries.\" What this effectively means is that you are signing up to fulfill the ambiguous goal of spreading the truth of the gospel. This ends up being quite narrow to a singular interpretation of scripture that often looks a lot more aligned with a conservative political viewpoint. \r\n\r\nFor example, Moody Radio constantly claims to be non-political, but constantly brings on guests that are anti net neutrality without any sort of second opinion from the other side of the aisle. Liberalism is a dirty word at Moody. Even if you have the Bible as your highest value, you have to keep any liberal views to yourself if you want to get ahead there. \r\n\r\nFor example, When the refugee crisis was at a high level, I was told that talking about it would be too political, so Moody wouldn\u2019t be taking an official position on the matter. This was not the first or the last time that Moody would avoid talking about what the Bible has to say about current event issues when the conclusions might affect the donor base. \r\n\r\nThis is a major aspect of working at Moody. There is constant talking about doing this or that to keep donors happy. Moody Bible Institute is able to give every student a fully-paid tuition because of the generosity of these donors. This is also the case with Moody Radio, which gets roughly 80% of its funding from donations. Again, this isn\u2019t a bad thing. That is how many non-profit or faith-based organizations work. Just understand that even though Moody talks about being only about the Bible, it is very limited to conservative interpretations of the Bible. \r\n\r\nAnother area of concern is the impossible to work with management at all levels at Moody. It has been pretty public that Moody removed their president, provost, and CFO in one fell swoop. The board has also taken a stronger theological position on the inerrancy of Scripture, requiring all faculty to sign off on the Chicago Statement on Inerrancy. These actions have had a chilling effect on all levels of leadership. People are very afraid of having an opinion that would be deemed dangerous or too liberal. \r\n\r\nSenior leadership is obsessed with making Moody relevant again, but they are unwilling to listen to people who have actual ideas with how to go about that. They rest on their experience and position, and constantly demean anyone who is a lower position than they are. Everyone is fighting a war over their fiefdom\u2014attempting to get as much power and control as they can, and it creates disfunction on many levels. It isn\u2019t uncommon for a higher-level position to retire, or move to another department, and have the rest of the team take things in a \u201cinterim\u201d capacity for five, six, seven (etc.) months. All the while feeling pressure from Senior leadership who make jokes about firing people because \u201cI\u2019m the boss.\u201d \r\n\r\nMoody isn\u2019t a bad place if you believe in what they are about. If it is an organization where you believe in their mission, there are real opportunities for you to work towards that end. But stray at all from their doctrine, and don\u2019t be surprised when you get passed over for other yes-men. By the time I left my role there, I was beaten down, discouraged, and didn\u2019t see any value in my work or myself.
