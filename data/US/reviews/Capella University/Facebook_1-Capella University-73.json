It is difficult.\r\n\r\nOverall, teams are not fully staffed, colleagues are overworked and underpaid and the excuses we get are laughable. Some Academic Coaches have over 800 learners assigned to them. It is INSANE.\r\n\r\nYour leader REALLY shapes your experience at the company.

Then you hear them all chat about how they all go golfing.\r\n\r\nMerit increases in the past year were hilariously low - they didn't even match the cost of living increase. However, the company didn't have to pay as much for utilities at offices, office supplies, coffee refills, bagel fridays, etc....Then, they laid a bunch of people off, and can't give those who keep the business running an adequate pay increase after the most stressful, difficult, hardworking year we've ever had where we were doing the jobs of our colleagues who were laid off. VERY FRUSTRATING.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, if you're quiet, you are pushed to be a type-A personality kind of person, which can be stressful\r\n\r\nEverything is very siloed and there are MANY hoops to jump through to get a project rolling. It is very inefficient and frustrating.\r\n\r\nToo many meetings. When is there actually time to get things done?\r\n\r\nThe investment in tech that they have made, while good-intentioned, is not adequate. It is all over the place. They have not invested in overall training for staff to understand the new things. Leadership takes the stance of \"just let them click around and figure it out\"\r\n\r\nOverall, staff is not tech savvy. This creates a lot of difficulty in communication and getting things done. \r\n\r\nOur benefits package has gotten a lot worse since the strayer merger. Not a fan.
