There is a lack of support from administration if you are a coach. If you do a good job there is no chance of getting a raise. There is a 1% or $1000 university wide raise most years but it\u2019s not guaranteed. The housing market in storm lake is crazy. You will definitely need a two person income if you are a coach and want to buy a house. They will try to sell you on the lake that the university sits on but the lake has dumping from Tyson and has known to have fish herpes. \r\nThe school will praise the amount of money they have in their endowment but do not pay the coaches very well. 65% of the students on campus are athletes. The endowment comes from athletics. Very little colored population in the school If you want a constant headache, lack of respect for trying to progress the university, no incentive to make more money, and a nasty smell coming from Tyson and the lake, then BVU is the place for you."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "BV", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Enrollment Counselor in Storm Lake, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Benefits and time off", "cons": "Pay could be better and work from home should be an option"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Interesting job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Security Officer in Storm Lake, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meet many people, know hours month in advance, and very straight forward job.", "cons": "Part-time gets no overtime, no holiday pay, and there is lots of drama one may have to respond to instead of \"actual\" calls."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Experience for Students", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Jan 2013", "job_title": "STA in Storm Lake, IA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone is so nice and we all work together well.
