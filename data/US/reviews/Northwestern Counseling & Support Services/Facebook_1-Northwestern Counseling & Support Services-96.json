My interviews were held over video conference, and my first tour through the agency was conducted with face masks and 6 feet social distancing in mind.

On my first day, every single person greeted me with a smile. \r\n\r\nWhen I say everyone greeted me with a smile, I mean it. And it didn\u2019t stop there. To this day, no matter what hall, building, or county I am in, every single person greets me with a smile. This attests to the kindness, compassion, and professionalism that all NCSS employees embody.
