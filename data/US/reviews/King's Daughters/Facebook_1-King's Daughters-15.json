If you are a care giver, you are under paid and over worked, and receive no real benefits that other's in same field receive. Example- Medical insurance.  If you need a procedure or test done at the place that employ's you, most hospitals cover that 100%.. Not at KDMC, you will pay 20%..     The \"Good ole boy\" scenario is alive and well at this company..\r\n Some of the best workers there have been discriminated against while the laziest people I have ever encountered do nothing. If the good worker \"complains\" then  the good worker gets in trouble !?!  The result of this happening over and over, means \"good workers\" end up fired or layed off...  What's left at the facility ?  Do you want care from these people ? Do you want to hire in and work in this environment ? This is a general over view.. There are some good people there, but they are not in the right position to make a difference or they are afraid for there job to try.."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible Food Service Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Food Service Worker in Ashland, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The insurance and perks are nice.
