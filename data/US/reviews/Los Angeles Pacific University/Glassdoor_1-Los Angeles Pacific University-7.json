APU is definitely top notch for a Christian University. LAPU is not. Don\u2019t believe me. They changed their billboards from \u201cOnline, Affordable, Christian\u201d to \u201cOnline, Affordable, non-profit\u201d. Not the best endorsement for a Christian workplace. \nHuman Resources was notorious for sharing personal and medical information with other coworkers. Example. One former employee had a mental breakdown after being bullied. She went on medical leave and then into litigation: so H R decided to have IT search her computer and found her journal which was shared with everyone. \nI had my medical info shared with another coworker who wasn\u2019t on my contact list. You would think H R knew the policy on an employee personal information that can and cannot be shared with anyone. Apparently not. That is pretty embarrassing for a director to not know basic employee privacy.\nA former employee mentioned how the Registrar and Support Central created bogus programs to push the non degree seeking students into a program that would show completion- which in turns pads the numbers to the Department of Education and the National Student Clearinghouse. This unfortunately caused many Active duty Military students to lose their tuition assistance. The new Support Central Dir responded \u201chave them use their GI Bill\u201d totally oblivious to the fact that it was too late AND it was a waste of GI Bill for Active Duty Soldiers. One soldier used her GI bill and was forced to pay back the Tuition Assistance because the new program wasn\u2019t approved by the Army.\nPadding the numbers worked! They made the top Military Friendly list after all of that.\nThankfully I am still connected with the Military Connected community that I get asked if LAPU is a good place to work, or school to attend, and I can steer them away from this soup sandwich. With all this free time on my hands I can make sure my community doesn\u2019t get sucked into this place."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Success Coach in San Dimas, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "6 weeks of PTO is great!", "cons": "Overworked, little pay, and not enough opportunities to move up"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Dec 2020", "job_title": "IT Help Desk in San Dimas, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome place for entry level positions", "cons": "Limited opportunities for growth and development"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "It's Great Except...", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Transfer Evaluator in San Dimas, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent PTO- 30 days, monthly lunches, and some great benefits (at least when I was there).
