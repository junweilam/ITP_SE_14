The psych communities, both the professionals and the consumers, are familiar with the bad reputation.  For this reason, no seasoned professional wants to work there.  Patients don't wish to stay there.  Staff are turning over frequently.  Seasoned staff are being replaced by new nurses out of school.  A set up for more failure.  Administration does not care.  Do not be mistaken.  They show every day that they do not care.\r\nStaff get attacked by patients and are told not to press charges?  It's true that psychiatric consumers have far more rights than the staff do, or it appears that way.
