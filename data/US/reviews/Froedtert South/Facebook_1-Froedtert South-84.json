Security is rude and focused more on where employees park but send texts about \"how annoying the patients are\" and calling them lazy. The upper management works their managers to the bone where it significantly affects their health. For example, department managers get heart attack work ups because they work non-stop through the pandemic and once, they take a vacation for themselves (after a full two years of no vacations) the stressed manager is guilted into shortening it. Or biased schedulers favoring their friends, giving holidays off to the people they like and working new employees when there is supposed to be a rotation in place. Once these things are brought to HR or directors lower-level employees are brushed off and treated with such dismissal they just quit because of exhaustion. How about being an employee of the hospital where you are forced to get medical work done because the company insurance only works at the Froedtert system and the OBGYN staff won't pay you any mind or discuss any concerns. What about catching a bacterial infection from the Post Op team. Or getting bruised and battered during surgery?
