Be ready for a lot of zoom meetings and that weird corporate smell in the building. \r\n\r\n-I honestly don't think the pay and benefits are that bad for community mental health if you are prelicensed. Once you are licensed and can bill insurance on your own then the pay is low. But I was warned in my Master's program getting into mental health that the pay is low so IDK maybe get better professors if you aren't ready to like, have a roommate for a year or two and make 45Kish for a while. There are cheap rent options available within 30 minutes of the agency that are still safe. This was something that was brought up a lot and..... I mean it is what it is, unionization for mental health workers is the only way out that I see. I could go on a rant about how pay symbolizes what our society values in America but people tell me it's a lot for a Tuesday. \r\n\r\n-trainings, at the agency and they'll send you to some out. They are free, however, if they are over zoom you will probably unofficially/officially still be working during these trainings. I was straight up asked to do work things once or twice when I was at \"a training\" so eh. Probably didn't get as much benefit from them as I could have.\r\n\r\n-get to meet people in your field \r\n\r\n-do get to work with interesting clientele and people who need treatment intensely\r\n\r\n-will say very openly LBGTQ+ affirming\r\n\r\n-I was specifically in substance abuse treatment and I did learn a lot, learned about safety planning, places to refer, treatment modalities for substance abuse, all in all not too shabby. It was trial by fire though, which can get a little sticky.", "cons": "-they have a lot of paperwork, which is a systemic issue in community mental health, but I feel based on my current employment that Northcare requires more in their notes than typical mental health centers, which generally go off of what's needed for insurance/Medicaid. Plus, they encouraged you to leave by 5:00-5:30 but are upset if you don't get the work done, but it takes 7 minutes to write a note that was a 5 minute phone call, versus me being able to write a therapy note in 3 minutes with all the required information for my new agency that still gets signed, audited, and billed. Something I don't understand but I will give them grace that maybe they have to justify more than other places, I don't know, but it was not it for me. \r\n\r\n-main reason I came back was for more feedback and more trainings so that I can become an effective therapist. I was burned out by the end of my time at Northcare (as you do), and now I am prelicensed in private practice and feel like I'm getting a more varied clientele and more feedback/consult opportunities here than I did there, so that negates a lot of their reasons for going there rather than somewhere else.\r\n\r\n-now with Covid there are online CEUs out the wazzoo so the trainings aren't really as appealing as they used to be. Also, the r/psychotherapy subreddit is absolutely great for gathering advice/perspective/consult. I thought I would have to be at a place like Northcare for guidance and I realize now that, as Maya Angelou said, nothing will work unless you do. Don't rely on your supervisor to do that for you at Northcare, they will most likely be too busy. Be your own advocate. \r\n\r\n-I have more time to talk with my current coworkers and am building better relationships with them than I did coworkers at Northcare. There are a lot of youngish prelicensed/newly licensed people there but in the role I was in I had so much paperwork I felt guilty if I ever was to take a break and talk to any of them/eat lunch/do anything other than after official work hours. \r\n\r\n-I had to deal with people in systems outside of mental health. I'm prelicensed, so new to the field and had no experience with this system. I have noticed other people saying they felt micromanaged at Northcare, but I had the opposite experience where they were operating under \"no news is good news,\" but I don't want my only feedback to be when I'm doing something wrong, then feeling defeated that I am getting in trouble for something that may not have been explicitly communicated from the start. It just gets to you after a while, particularly if you come from a love is earned environment..... I even went online to try to get more consult on working with this particular system (I'll just go ahead and say it was the legal justice system) but they are all so varied and treatment's role / ethics change so much for each one I couldn't get a solid grip on best practice the way I can when I'm learning about an evidenced-based practice, for example. They were trying to put me in another role after I told them I was thinking about leaving but after a week or two I realized I was too burned out and just needed to leave. Which sucks for the clients but it's common in the system. \r\n\r\n-I don't want to be micromanaged but some feedback that I'm generally doing what I need to be doing would be nice. Also, if I'm having conflicts with people in this system, then some role-plays on appropriate ways to draw boundaries with people in a leadership role would have been nice. Instead they just told me to \"draw boundaries\" and then told me not to worry, or just say \"I'll ask and find out.\" You can figure out how that went. (Spoiler, I was constantly anxious regarding this individual in a leadership position outside of Northcare and felt like he was trying to run me out of my job. I guess in the end he did.) So, building a network of people to consult with may be a good idea. If I could go back I would make a point to talk to other providers in the area about their practices within the legal system to ensure I was doing the right thing, rather than relying on a supervisor who really didn't have the experience of the role I was doing, and being trained by a peer who was understandably burned out as well. \r\n\r\nSo, at the end of the day, being a new therapist is hard. If you want health benefits and want to work with adults I would advise going here, doing the intake team for a yearish, taking advantage of trainings/being able to take off without having to reschedule a lot of people (because you will probably only have maybe 5 clients you actually see for therapy,) then from there decide if you want to go to a particular program within Northcare or then look at other places for a different experience. \r\n\r\nCommunity mental health is kinda like the Walmart of mental health, its providing to a lot of people so the quality is a mixed bag. The insurance/credentialing system in the state/nation makes it where basically new yuppies out of school are working with people who need experienced therapists, but that's not what they get. Additionally, depending on how staffed/understaffed/who's in a management role, it can either be an amazing place for treatment or you are just a number. It all really depends and fluctuates from year to year, as it most likely does for ALL the community health/large corporations/organizations in the area. \r\n\r\nMost random thing about my time there, I wish they had a Starbucks closer to Northcare so that I could have gone to a coffee shop at lunch just to take a break. Stitch isn't too far away, but still a bit of a drive when you really only get 30 minute lunches :/ I know that's terrible when some of the people who come in are truly truly suffering from a capitalistic society but lunch breaks off of work have always been a major coping component for me in the past, so instead of only needing to get through 4 hour increments of work until I had something to look forward to it was like, 9 hours straight of people arguing with me/paperwork. Honestly I don't even like to think about it for too long.\r\n\r\nBut honestly.... the worst thing they do there.... is REPLY ALL to sooooo many emails. I'm generally laid back, Grateful Dead live-your-truth hippy dippy kind of gal but that is just unacceptable workplace behavior. When I left I had 300 unread emails that I just left because there were so many reply all \"Wow guys, thanks!\" emails. Truly unforgivable in modern America. Just text/tiktok/dm your friends at work instead of repying all to a work email, my God."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Case Manager in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management is supportive and does their best to be flexible and understanding of your needs.", "cons": "High caseloads and change happens often"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "fun place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Therapist in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of support and training.", "cons": "consumer base can be difficult if it is not your passion"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Care Navigator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Care Navigator in Oklahoma City, OK", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Leadership can be flexible.

It really helped me see how much I LOVED community mental health and working for a nonprofit. \r\n-Pay: I am hesitant to put this on here because I truly believe for a non profit and ethical community mental health agency the pay is comparable if not competitive.
