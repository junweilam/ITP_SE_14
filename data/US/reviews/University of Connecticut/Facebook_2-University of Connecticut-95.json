FT benefits are excellent. Storrs & Hartford campuses are vibrant and fun places to teach. Classrooms generally up-to-date. Students are generally engaged depending on campus. Many teaching development (e.g. lunch & learns) programs that also expose you to other schools and departments. Teaching online has good training, tech, and faculty support but pay is poor. Adjuncts full access to libraries, email, software from until 1 term after last semester. Online or in-person, it's a lot of work for little pay often based on random student evals (SETs) which are only used for non-tenured faculty.", "cons": "Three major things: PAY SUCKS with no security, HR has no power, and research rules far above teaching. Research is God, and change is not welcome. Tenured faculty rule everything, There is a HUGE difference between non tenure-track/tenured (NTT) and tenure-track/tenured faculty (TT). Adjuncts are in their own group at the very bottom with no support, no rights, no security. NTT Instructors/Professors in Residence are paid 40% of new, inexperienced PhD TT, 30% of average tenured BASE salary depending on school . . I was teaching 7 classes, 4 courses, 350 students; advising 60; overseeing 5 honors theses; actively serving on 2 school committees and then still had to \"publish or perish.\" TT teach 3, nothing else but research/publish. Tenured find small roles like Program Director to reduce course load to 3 + a few advisees + 1 comm. BIG SUCK: By AAUP's contract, NTT faculty can receive max 5 annual contracts; then they go multi-year (3 & 5 yr). Multi-year contracts include nice but very expensive perks like paid sick leave. THE KICKER: depts & colleges don't want the risk & cost of multi-year contracts, usually preferring to hire new NTT on contracts that require more work for lower salary & perks. Thus typically first 2 evals include a small random thing to improve. At the 3rd eval (4th yr for AY5 contract) they can say warnings weren't corrected and not renew, avoiding the multi-year cost and commitment REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO. HR, well, forget it. A tenured faculty was harassing me: drunk dialing, cursing, email spyware, & finally personal threats. I followed procedure: dept head (their best friend), HR, AAUP. HR said tenured faculty, no can do. Dept head told me I had no proof and no one would believe me. Union wrote a letter to my file for me. Salaries are well below market, and the culture is dysfunctional. It's a solo gig designed by people who don't like working with others. No teams, rare to see or interact with colleagues. Faculty only come to campus for meetings, class, and office hours and keep to themselves. Student eval scores (SET) are the core of dept reviews. Teaching quality is not valued nor recognized in evals regardless of awards. You have to really love teaching to come to UConn because you won't be paid or treated well, there's a 4 year unspoken contract limit, you jump through hoops to get the position, and the benefits aren't worth it."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good teaching opportunities in math", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Teaching Assistant in Storrs, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "*As a math TA you get to teach a variety of courses as a TA, and often have opportunities to teach as an instructor of record in your last years. *There is a union *Faculty that I interacted with were extremely supportive", "cons": "*Small town, so if you like more city areas with more to do, or if you don't have a car, that could be a downside."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "So far so good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Storrs, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Support for research.

Supervisors teach you everything you need to know and between games (or quarters/halves) they point out little things you should work on.

Intramurals run on a late night schedule to avoid conflicts with classes, so normal hours are 5:30 pm - 11:30 pm Sunday through Thursday. For some of us, this is no problem. For others, this conflicts with the college lifestyle of going out late during the week or having time to do homework/study during the evening. The pay for working here is slightly above minimum wage, so for the verbal abuse you may encounter from participants at times and the physical tole it takes on you to run around for six hours on a court or field, it can be a rough trade off.

You wont learn much from the lectures ( mostly PPT based), have to study by your own. Grad school experiences differs from student to student. I would advise you to chose only American advisers. An International adviser might make your life a living hell ( my case). Also if you have any concern regarding your adviser, Graduate school will take your advisers side. So choose your adviser carefully. You can take an independent study course with him for a semester in order to know him better. Ask your lab mates about the lab enviornment. Most of the international advisers are funding hungry hence they will make your life a living nightmare ( my adviser used to call me on fedral holidays and over weekends).
