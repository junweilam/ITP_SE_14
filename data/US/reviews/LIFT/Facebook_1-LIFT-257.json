LIFT is a great opportunity for students like myself to gain experience with a wide variety of populations: the recently incarcerated, individuals with mental illness, people with disabilities, single parents, and the homeless, among others.  The clients had a variety of life goals which kept my days very interesting: you had people who wanted to pursue nursing, entrepreneurship, culinary school, and criminal justice.  I admire the strength of LIFT's clients and their dedication to both their families and their community. \r\n\r\n-Exposure to a wide variety of public and private agencies: clients encountered a variety of obstacles in their life ranging from foreclosure to domestic violence to unemployment and everything in between.  I learned a tremendous amount about federal and state benefits, as well as specialized services in my city such as health clinics, shelters, parenting classes, college readiness programs, immigrant welcome centers, free legal advocates....anything you could imagine.  This knowledge is invaluable for any student who wants to prepare for government employment, non-profit jobs, or work in human services.  I am a more discerning reader of social policy research and a stronger activist thanks to my experience at LIFT.", "cons": "-Shortsighted strategic growth plan: I had been thinking about writing a Glassdoor review of LIFT for several months now, but I'm glad I waited.  If you had asked me to rate LIFT earlier in 2015, I would have given the organization 2 or 3 stars.   In wake of LIFT's recent decision to close three of its offices, a 2-star review would be providing this nonprofit with far too much credit.  How could LIFT in good conscience shutter its doors in three of America's largest cities, depriving thousands of existing clients from accessing vital services?  The organization has a growing base of donors, so this decision was not for lack of funding.  I am truly disgusted by LIFT's blatant disregard for its own core values: \"Collaboration,\" \"Service,\" \"Relationships,\" and \"Human Potential.\"  LIFT was a lifeline for many community members when other organizations turned their back.  No other organization in my city had such a strong commitment to eliminating red tape and to serving ALL residents, no referral or documentation needed. \r\n\r\n In the words of one client, \"without LIFT a lot of people would have no hope.\"  I fear for the wellbeing of LIFT clients.  The truth is that many organizations are simply at a point of saturation and have no room to provide new clients with assistance.  LIFT's management claims the decision was made to focus services on children and family, but do they realize the harm they have caused to families in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia affected by the closure?  LIFT could have invested in better resources for children/families by providing employees in these offices with additional training and piloting new programs, but instead they thought it would be more effective to simply shut down half of their offices nationwide.  This is irresponsible on so many levels: not only for the clients and employees, but for the donors who provided grants to these specific branches.  In the case of Philadelphia, a construction company generously remodeled the office six months prior to the closure (which by the way, was only announced one month in advance).  Had they known about the closure earlier, they most likely would have invested in a different organization more committed to longevity. \r\n\r\n-Disorganized supervisors:  administration at local LIFT offices is a revolving door. These positions are primarily staffed by Americorps members, most of whom are fresh out of college and know scarcely more what they are doing than student workers (in many cases, less).   My supervisors would depict themselves as a \"resource,\" but they answered our questions by telling us to simply use Google.  Some of my supervisors were new to the city and had very limited knowledge about local organizations.   Most frustrating was the lack of communication between the supervisors.  The Americorps management team at the Philly office was outrageously bloated (six supervisors), and they were not on the same page with each other.  Many of us student workers got formally disciplined for following the advice of a supervisor, because another supervisor would tell us it was inaccurate.  Contradicting instructions were rampant, and we never knew which supervisor was giving us correct information. We were constantly breaking policies that we didn't know existed, and almost every day I would leave the office feeling demoralized.  \r\n\r\n\r\n-Wasted opportunities:  I often thought that LIFT could be doing so much more to help clients.   For months on end, I'd feel like we were just spinning wheels: shooting out online job applications for every hotel in Philadelphia and then starting all over again.  Many administrators and board members are well-connected: why couldn't they have brought recruiters into the office?  hosted a job fair? collaborated with other organizations to develop on-site training programs? We were constantly shuttling off clients to other places to get CPR certified, enroll in GED coursework, take Home Health Aide exams, complete coding classes, etc. Some of these weren't viable options for clients due to transportation or financial barriers (or programs that simply reached  full capacity). Providing more on-site services would have been immensely beneficial for clients, but workers who suggested this got shot down. \r\n\r\n On a similar note: why not collect nonperishable foods to give to clients? My heart broke every time I had to tell a client that we couldn't provide them with food. For many clients, food pantry hours were not compatible with their schedules or they couldn't afford the bus token to make it to a pantry.  I raised this issue with several supervisors and they simply told me that LIFT is about \"teaching people to fish.\"  The clients were trying their darndest to \"fish,\" but an elderly lady with a walker simply cannot walk half a mile to pick up canned goods in the blazing heat.  \r\n\r\nLIFT's unresponsiveness to a clients' needs for bus/subway tokens cost many clients valuable opportunities.A client of mine was thrilled to land an interview at a convenience store, but the only location that was hiring was in the other side of the city. He had to decline the interview because he had exhausted all his savings and could not afford a single subway token.   If LIFT can afford new office furniture, a Keurig machine, pizza for the staff, a big screen TV for the reception area, etc., then they could afford to provide clients with an occasional token for emergency situations."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Innovative and Inclusive Culture", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "LIFT has an extremely positive culture that welcomes all perspectives in finding creative solutions to eliminating systemic poverty.
