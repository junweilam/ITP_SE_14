I thought, \"well that won't happen to me.\"  I was wrong!  \r\n\r\n1- Absolutely no training provided.  You are thrown to the wolves from day one.  Managers MIGHT introduce new employees around the office,  but usually do not.  This leaves new employees to blindly figure out who to talk to.\r\n\r\n2- There is no consistency in management.  At all.  You can speak to three different managers in one day and get three entirely different answers to the same question.  They do not talk to each other and basically expect the employees to deliver messages to other managers.  \r\n\r\n3- Snide remarks, rude behavior, talking badly about employees is a daily occurrence by management.  You will overhear conversations between management and employees that should be left behind closed doors.  Managers will literally come to your desk and ask what you think about other employees, while making fun of them.  If you think it hasn't happened to you personally, you're most likely wrong.  \r\n\r\n4- Management DOES NOT have your back.  EVER.  They put up a good front, and say they will back you.   But the moment your back is turned they will strike, and make you look like the worst employee they've ever had.  \r\n\r\n5- HR does NOT have your back either.  They are in cahoots with managers and will do anything they can to sabotage you, and destroy your work and reputation.  \r\n\r\n6- Expect meetings about you to happen without you being there.  Several people will hold meetings about employees and won't invite the employee to explain anything.  \r\n\r\n7- Extremely high turnover.  In my time there I can't even count how many employees quit or mysteriously disappeared from the office one day.  Even the Doctor's at Sequoia leave!  \r\n\r\n8- Different expectations for people on the same team.  You will find yourself resenting coworkers because they will be treated much differently than you are.  \r\n\r\n9- They will fire you at the drop of a hat.  You will not see it coming.  You will not have verbal or written warnings.  Nothing. \r\n\r\n10- If you are let go, and try to collect unemployment, expect them to fight you tooth and nail.  They will lie like mad to make it appear that you were an awful employee.  Keep records of EVERYTHING.  Every conversation you have with management get it in writing.  This will come in handy later when you try to defend yourself.  \r\n\r\nI could go on, as there are many more negative things that happen in that agency. If I could give them zero stars, I would have.  I loved my job, I loved the clients, but I have nothing good to say about management.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are thinking about working at Sequoia my advice is RUN!  RUN FAR FAR AWAY!"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worse place to work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Residential Counselor in Aloha, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only good thing about this place is getting to know and help clients through their recovery", "cons": "Horrible to staff and clients \r\nNo respect for staff and clients \r\nNo pay differential for graveyard \r\nTreats staff differently after on job injuries or pregnancy. \r\nStaff talks behind back\r\nDoes not drug test staff who are working with clients in treatment. \r\nDON'T WORK HERE"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "ACT Clinician", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Clincian in Aloha, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Clients are awesome to work with, broad range of duties, some awesome clinicians that really care.", "cons": "Horrible organizational issues, no training of any purpose, steep learning curve, largest turnover rate I have ever encountered, management cares little for employees as employees quit or let go constantly, was asked to do things I find unethical when came to charting and billing."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Listen to the bad reviews- they are all right!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Front Desk Receptionist in Aloha, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "24 days off\r\nNice, friendly people at the top", "cons": "Unpredictable and at times, dangerous, clientele, weird shift patterns, employees talk about people suffering from mental illness in a disrespectful manner (e.g. complaining about having a crisis line and almost boasting about how many previous patients they have had commit suicide)"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "QMHA", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Community Integration Specialist in Beaverton, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Sequoia is the best team player organization I have had the pleasure of being part of.
