Worked in a department where the department head literally changed the schedule at least weekly and required employees to work back to back holidays - no rotation between employees.  He's offended when employees ask why the changes are being made.  Certain employees are treated unfairly in terms of the amount of work done.  Increased workload times three then threatens a write up if employee is unable to complete work before shift ends.  Favored employees are allowed to sit and watch Sunday games while certain others work continuously.  Management will literally sit and watch certain employees work all day.  The ones not working at all aren't being watched.  No feedback for evaluations whatsoever other that an email to sign off.  One literally has no clue how they are performing unless there is something negative to report and it's only given when it suits some other agenda.  Hospital has too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  Budget is off because department heads create unnecessary positions that aren't needed for a hospital that size.
