Think about the concept of a good test-taker. This person has the ability to memorize large amounts of information, and reproduce it accurately in a span of 1 hour 15 minutes or less. \r\n- Now think about the concept of a good researcher. This person has the ability to creatively combine new ideas together with existing ideas from reference materials. A typical research project last months or even years. \r\n- The ability to memorize large amounts of data is generally not applicable in research, because reference materials are always available. \r\n- Skills like fast handwriting and fast memory response are likewise not meaningful in the context of a 2 or 3 year research project. \r\n- So it is unfortunate that Purdue (and many other schools) allows their faculty to continue to evaluate students in such a rushed, haphazard manner. \r\n- Obviously, evaluation based on semester-long projects is not a sufficient solution, because there is no control over who is actually doing the work. Same argument applies to homework. \r\n- A compromise is to simply allow more time for exams. Perhaps 3-4 hours. This cannot be done during the allotted lecture hour, so some schools have transitioned to giving exams in specialized testing centers. Students can go to the center when their schedules permit, and test proctors monitor them during the exam. \r\n- Also, to avoid rewarding memorization, non-electronic reference materials should be allowed during exams. \r\n- Everyone wins with this approach.  Professors don't need to sacrifice class days for exams. Students can be evaluated based on their knowledge (and even creativity), rather than speed.
