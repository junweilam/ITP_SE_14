Constant backfilling that never comes through, because they cannot get their hands on qualified talent (because they refuse to pay for qualified talent). Their solution to this is hiring students fresh out of college and egregiously underpaying them until they move on; then rinse, repeat.

Science and humanities pay is lower than engineering and business, regardless of background, which creates some inequality. Overall compensation is adequate for the cost of living in West Lafayette, although this is changing with the recent inflation in home prices in West Lafayette by 50% from 2017 - 2022. Purdue does not provide a home-buying allowance to incoming faculty. Several of the paid benefits and some insurance products (such as paid time off or sick leave/FMLA) do not apply in the summer for academic year employees, which is annoying."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Flexible", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Undergraduate Research Assistant in West Lafayette, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible hours, friendly and helpful co-workers", "cons": "Low pay, hard to make work with heavy courseload"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in West Lafayette, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Purdue is a great place to work in", "cons": "Somewhat isolated city in West Lafayette that you don't have much to do"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good place to work at", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Teaching Assistant in West Lafayette, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary on par with peers.

There really aren't that many opportunities for advancement or developing skills, unless you want to enter management...and know the right people. Within the past few years, Purdue rolled out a program to try to guide staff on career trajectories. To the best of my knowledge, the program has been a dismal failure, as departments fight for fancy sounding titles that don't allow employees to move or advance anywhere within Purdue.\r\n\r\nPurdue University suffers from several problems which one should seriously consider before applying or making the move.\r\n-Did you grow up near West Lafayette, or did you attend Purdue University? If not, skip. There is a strong sense that someone from this region or from Purdue is a better candidate or employee than anyone else around. This feeling flows into hirings, promotions, salary raises, firings, etc. I've had knowledgeable colleagues just completely sidelined and ignored because they weren't from Purdue, or because someone who graduated from Purdue said the opposite thing. This also creates a challenging climate for anyone who has seen things done better elsewhere because the answer to any suggestion is basically that Purdue is the best so why change?\r\n-Purdue is a moderately ranked public R1 institution, yet there is considerable pride and ego here. I've worked at Ivy League institutions and was surprised to find that the sense of strength in reputation and academic programs here rivals those found at more noteworthy places. The dirty secret is that the electrical and computer engineering and aerospace programs are the strongest, while the rest of the university is along for the ride. Along with that, the most open-minded departments are the ones who know they actually are strong programs (engineering).\r\n-The faculty detest Mitch Daniels, the president, but he is probably one of the university's greatest assets. Daniels is a well-known and decorated public figure, and has worked to make the costs of higher education more manageable. Unfortunately, many faculty can't stomach that a non-researcher like Daniels gets the spotlight instead of them.\r\n-Nepotism is a powerful thing here. One way it happens is that among staff, many of them are spouses of faculty, and spousal hires occur more often here than any other institution I've ever worked at. The second way it happens is because of that disproportionate sense of regional and institutional pride: because many of the employees went to school here or grew up here, they tend to hire their friends for plum jobs. This means that if you are an \"outsider\" you will find yourself with less salary, more work, little chance for promotion, and more constraints on your time so that \"insiders\" can disappear from the office with their boss.\r\n-The spousal hire situation may make faculty happy, but is toxic for staff. The result is that there are a bunch of unhappy people trying to look busy while not being busy. This results in people not really wanting to resolve issues, not really caring if tasks get done, and playing petty politics. Buck-passing is rife here, among staff and management.\r\n-And why are spouses generally hired at Purdue University? Because of the small size and isolation of the town, there are few potential employers within 50 miles. So another reason why there are many unhappy staff is that there is nowhere else to go.\r\n-In almost every department, there is one real \"trooper\" who is down in the trenches, diligently working and can be trusted to get things done in a timely and correct manner. Once you identify these individuals, it is a pleasure to work with them. But cherish the time you spend, because soon they disappear."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Underpaid and overworked", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Student Office Coordinator in West Lafayette, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have had some wonderful bosses and management that truly care about their staff.

Work atmosphere is a crapshoot: depending on placement, it can vary widely amongst buildings, shifts, and/or supervisors. I met and had a good working relationship with a few coworkers, some others hostile (through no initiation on my part), and many more not worth remembering. Work-life balance is poor: due to the high turnover rate, many areas remain vacant for months, and skeleton crews will have to pick up the slack. Winter shut down was a blessing, as it was one of the few times I could truly rest and fully focus on my personal interests and hobbies.\r\n\r\nShould you decide to work as a custodian here, do not overextend yourself, because the only acknowledgements you will receive will be 1) an unreasonable increase in workload, and 2) reprimanding when you are unable to always and consistently meet these ever-increasing expectations.

As previously stated, it's a crapshoot, and there obviously is no universal experience when it comes to such a subject.

The university does have a lot of internal scholarships and fellowships, particularly in the College of Engineering. They also have professional development workshops on a regular basis. And the health insurance is not too costly. West Lafayette is a decent college town and a more liberal area for that part of Indiana. Indianapolis and Chicago are fairly close drives.", "cons": "Even though the cost of living in the Lafayette area is pretty low, the average Purdue University graduate student pay is also pretty low. And that pay varies significantly by department. You may end up being a teaching assistant every one of your semesters here, for less than 15,000 a year. (On the other hand, outside scholarships like the National Science Foundation graduate fellowship goes a long way here). Also, Purdue University has a lot of bureaucracy and it is a fairly large school, so sometimes graduate students can feel lost and under appreciated here. The fees for engineering students are the highest in the nation, about 2,500 a year, which can be a significant part of your salary!
