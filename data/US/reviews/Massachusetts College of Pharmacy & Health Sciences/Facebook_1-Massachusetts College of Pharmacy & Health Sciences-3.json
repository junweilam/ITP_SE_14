Deans feel like they own the place, many have been here almost their whole life so they feel like some kind of royalty. Almost feels like they're trying to make up for some attention and prestige they didn't get to have when they were college-aged. Too bad more people can't come in and help shake up this ancient way they've adopted. They get into a comfort zone and refuse to consider change, even if it's mandatory. I've heard staff members say they're \"being treated like a student\", as if that's a bad thing. So they've created a divide between them and students, as if they're better than the students. This place feels like a corporation more than a college. Decisions have been made mostly on the preferences of higher ups than the needs of students, and the students feel that. Dare you ask a Dean to compromise to help another department, you will be spoken to real unpleasantly. If you try to defend yourself against them, your boss will buckle their knees to the higher up, so you lose the trade regardless, feeding these people's sense of entitlement. The University needs more uniformity on how they handle conflicts, very unprofessional at times speaking with people who claim to be professionals just because of their degrees and years working here. Unfortunately, they will continue to lose good workers because of this poor environment and culture. The time off is nice, but maybe we wouldn't want so much time off if the environment was more pleasant. Certain roles are constantly opening over and over, makes you wonder why. Also, if you don't know the right people, you will not know half of what is going on here. You have to be the right kind of person to get in the inner circle, or have been here long enough (10+years) to know the history and provide insight. The models here seem so sketchy I wouldn't be surprised if this place shuts down in the next several years. They also have no space for half the things they try to do. Students are always on each other in the lounge/study rooms, bathrooms are always full and dirty/stinky. Students seem downtrodden most days. This place needs more campus space, but they've let other colleges expand and take over all the local real estate. They try to express concern for all these things mentioned, but most of it feels fake. They had a training on diversity and inclusion and faculty made remarks during that training that confirmed for me this place will never really learn how to be inclusive. There is a high international student population too, likely because of the money they bring, which makes some of those remarks I heard during that training even more concerning. The person who made the comments was not held accountable either, so what was the point of that training?"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "This is an alright place to work as full-time staff.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is alright, 2 weeks off at the holidays that are not out of PTO are a great perk, and benefits are good.", "cons": "Pay could definitely be better.
