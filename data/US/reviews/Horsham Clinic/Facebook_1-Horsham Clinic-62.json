Most of them were very dedicated to the field and had my back in many challenging situations.\r\nI found the job to be extremely rewarding on a personal level. I felt enlightened by the many unique situations I was put while working with the patients, even the extremely difficult ones.\r\nIt offered me an opportunity to work with a diverse population of psychiatric patients, ranging greatly in age and severity of illnesses. \r\nWhile working as an EMT I visited all of the major psych hospitals in the south east PA area, this one has by far the best staff and seems the least detrimental to the patients well being (not to imply Horsham is a godsend...).\r\nHorsham is by no means a hell hole, I witnessed many positive interactions between patients and staff and I am happy I spent almost a year working there.

I would say 70% of all the shifts I worked were understaffed. This can cause serious threats to ones safety if you are working on units with aggressive patients. Lack of staffing leads to many patients needs being unmet, and their mental health either staying static or further worsening. The only patients who have a chance of seeing improvement are the ones who are already relatively under control mentally or have means of stability in their personal lives; those who are low functioning seem to be stuck in a cycle of going back and forth from the hospital and their broken lives, from my perspective. This is not to say the cycle is completely Horshams fault, however the therapeutic treatment they provide often seems so limited that some patients seem bound to return or have trouble reaching a point they seem fit to leave. \r\nThere is barely anything for the patients to do on the units. It was heartbreaking to watch patients deteriorate after sometimes months of under-stimulation. There is little to no scheduled activity besides \"groups\" which are run by the social workers. These groups function like community meetings for the patients, which are valuable but only last for about an hour. Its up to the nurses and techs to entertain the patients for the remainder of the day, which is difficult considering all the shifts are already understaffed! \r\nMedication is the substitute for real therapeutic counseling, working as a tech or nurse means you will have to reinforce this pharmaceutical philosophy using force. What many of the patients need is extensive and focused therapy with a counselor, but instead get TV, bored games, and walls to stare at while doped up on 10mg of Ativan. \r\nThe pay is also very low for techs considering how dangerous the job can be at times.\r\nThey constantly barrage you on your time off with calls and text messages about picking up extra shifts. While they do offer generous compensation for these bonus hours, the amount texts they send is absurd and shows how desperate they are to keep their hospital afloat."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "MHT  position", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jan 2022", "job_title": "MHT in Ambler, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunity for overtime \r\nNice coworkers \r\nFairly big hospital", "cons": "No support from upper management \r\nFast turnover rates\r\nWill get moved around units a lot"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Find a better place to work.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Mental Health Technician in Ambler, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Offered benefits and bonuses occasionally.
