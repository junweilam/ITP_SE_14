Our division has experienced major instability of leadership for years, churning through multiple associate provosts, senior directors, and at least one VP (not including the P resigning during that time and numerous interim leaders that have come and gone). The HR department experiences constant churn (can't imagine why), and the hiring process is byzantine and slow.

Tenured faculty hold a considerable amount of power and influence, too much in some cases. There are some very large egos among tenured faculty, but also some incredible educators and researchers. It's a mixed bag. Sadly, adjunct faculty are still significantly underpaid and undervalued, which is the case across all of higher ed. As a staff member, there is NOT a lot of opportunity for upward mobility. People in mid-level and especially higher-level positions tend to stay in them for a long time, because the pay and benefits are so good. There is much more frequent turnover among lower-level positions, many of which don't pay very well compared to similar jobs in a corporate environment.

Parking is a nightmare. Campus is under constant construction for past few years. \r\n\r\nOne more thing to consider about the income for a graduate student, if you are even so lucky to be in a field that has research stipends.  First of all the amount you are 'awarded' is very misleading A third of it will go towards tuition, which seems like a good deal the first two years that you take classes but after classes are over you will begin to wonder what you are still paying tuition for. What services is the school rendering for you at that point? Especially when every bit of equipment and software you use is paid for by some sort of government research grant. And when a research group is awarded a big grant from the NSF or NIH or whatever the school automatically gets a huge cut of that.  So after tuition you get your measly paycheck but you're not free yet. You must still pay the semester student fees which total over $1000 a year if you are a 'full-time student'. You could reduce these fees by only signing up for the bare minimum of credit hours but then you would not get the discount on health insurance, and plus you need a completely arbitrary amount of research credit hours to be able to graduate."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Generally a great company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Assistant in Fort Collins, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have a fabulous boss, which always makes all the difference.
