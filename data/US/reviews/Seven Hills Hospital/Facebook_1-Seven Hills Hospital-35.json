My co-workers I started with three years ago were awesome, competent and friendly. The doctors are very nice and I enjoyed learning from them. However, about a year and a half ago the CEO changed and things went downhill drastically. She cut back staff dramatically and constantly undermined her directors. She would call lower level staff directly and try to get them to do the opposite of what the director had just told them to do. I have been in healthcare for over 25 years and I have never seen a CEO behave the way she did. She made our work life chaotic, hectic, and just unbearable.
