So, I am doing a ton of Medical Assistant level admin work, which means I don't have room in my schedule to see many patients. But the clinic's argument is that we are short-staffed.\r\n\r\nPay is low-ish, and raises are very hard to come by. You can really only expect a 2-4% raise each year and it's not merit based...literally just a standard \"cost of living\" raise, which obviously does not match inflation. My understanding with speaking with other intermountain dietitians that the dietitian manager positions don't pay very much and not worth it. \r\n\r\nThe dietitian salaries are done by tiers. So, what tier you fall in depends on your years of experience and advanced certifications. There's entry dietitian, dietitian specialist I, dietitian specialist II, and I believe there may be a level III. I was able to get a 5% raise and bumped to specialist II when I passed a second certification exam on top of my CDCES. This year, the dietitian profession at the company got a salary adjustment of 4.5% which is nice and has not happened in the 3 years I've been here, so I did get some \"big\" raises this year."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Toxic", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Reimbursement Specialist in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Well pay, good benefit, good reputation", "cons": "Long hours, workload is heavy"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Increase pay to a living wage.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Murray, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people I work with.", "cons": "The pay could be better."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "A really good place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Software Engineer in West Valley City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Management was fantastic.

even after years of talking about change.

They also were flip-floppers, constantly changing their thoughts and opinions based on the day. Leadership at the top is too focused on saving face with executive leadership. They also always try to look like they are doing something, rather than setting a clear direction so the team can actually do positive, effective work. Leadership doesn't trust the team members in the department and try to do too much themselves, and they are failing. The department (if my count is right), has lost over 20 well qualified people over the last year due to poor leadership and direction. Leaving behind lifers, or those who are unmotivated and are just going through the motions. If you want to use your skills and talents, learn and grow, this is not the place for you.

Marketing will say things like \"We are patient focussed\" but then keep doing the same things they've done for years. Unfortunately, this involves making ELT happy over patient needs. The consumer experience department is a dream of the chief marketing officer but lacks support from a lot of the executive leaders, therefore, it causes a lot of infighting and confusion among the various groups. Several people have stated we have weak leadership and I agree. Tough decisions are rarely made and drawn out over months or years. No understandable goals or priorities are set.\r\n\r\nMost of my time here has been empty promises and dragging out processes for years that should take less than a month or two, such as hiring new employees. Many of my colleagues have left because they didn't feel their skillsets would be valued or used properly. You get hired working with a specific skill set, but because leadership is always changing their mind on the team's purpose, you become a project manager or business analyst, even though you have a completely different skill set.\r\n\r\nThe teamwork has completely disappeared. The director over consumer insights has completely changed the culture and it's much more about micromanagement and belittlement instead of empathy for patients or teamwork. It's been horrible working in this environment and mondays feel like a nightmare now.\r\n\r\nThis is a trap if you want to grow in your career because you don't work on projects long enough to build strong knowledge and 90% of projects just disappear. They tell you that you have to accept ambiguity, but this feels like a distraction because they just don't know what they are doing. Half of the time has been spent debating how to handle workflows. An uphill battle.\r\n\r\nIf they can't treat their workers right what makes anyone think it will change when it comes to the patient?

In a glass ceiling, a woman would be able to see how to move to upper management, but be unable to do so. As the following will demonstrate, the promotional doors to upper leadership are not offered to women. Intermountain has very few female leaders in its top levels (VP, SVP, and C Suite.) The few female leaders who are at that level have been leaving the organization (Previous Chief Operating Officer, the departing Chief Nursing Officer...)\r\n\r\nThe information in this review draws from senior leaders public teleconferences and general announcements to employees, so nothing here has been labelled confidential. I removed peoples names and just use their titles because this isn't directed at an individual, but the overall machismo culture that has taken over at Intermountain Healthcare executive  levels.\r\n\r\nThe organization stated publicy where it builds its new executive leaders from, the Enterprise Initiatives Office, which is  under the Chief Strategy Officer (male) and Chief Operating Officer (male). In a recent public teleconference for the Scottsdale Institute, he explained explained that this  office is the incubator for future Intermountain executive team members. It's the door through the glass ceiling, so if you get in, you get access to the highest paying opportunities. (highly recommend listening to this just do a web search for it)\r\n\r\nHow does one apply to be a part of this incubator? One doesn't. The leadership 'appointments' of this group are apparently only given to men. This is demonstrated to employees over numerous emails.  Take for example the statements to employees regarding the series of high level promotion opportunities for which there is no opportunity for women to apply:\r\n\r\nIn an August 8 email, the CEO  stated simply described the process as this man  \"will become\" the Chief Strategy Officer and Vice President. No invitation to apply, no announcement of opportunity, no attempt to find qualified candidates. No opportunity for the majority female candidates in the company to apply. In a September 24 email, the Chief Strategy Officer who was suddenly now promoted to Senior Vice President instead of just being the vice president he was the month before (it pays to be on the insid), announced more lucrative leadership opportunities were being given to additional men.\r\n\"[a male] has been appointed Vice President of the Enterprise Initiative Office...\"\r\n\"[another male] has been appointed Vice President of the Market Intelligence and Planning Office...\"\r\n\r\n(As pointed out in the teleconference, which you really should listen to for yourself, the only woman to 'advance' out of the incubator was a woman who was promoted \"out of the company\". The Chief Strategy Officers email to employees about it he said he \"was sad to see her leave Intermountain\". We were too. Intermountain needed female leaders. )\r\n\r\nCompare this appointing process in contrast to the process many female leaders go through:\r\nA September 12 announcement for an Executive Nurse Director states she went through a \"selection\". Or when the announcement regarding the departure of the chief nursing officer (one of the few remaining female executives), in a position which is typically female the CEO stated the process for getting this position will involve \"A national search is underway to fill [the] role\" It is frustrating to see the incubator for executive opportunities so closed here, wouldnt it be nice if women could be just appointed to positions like the men in the executive incubator.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it continues. A few months ago my area was moved under a Decision Support analytics team. The new leadership opportunity for the combined groups was never announced to the women and we were never given the opportunity to apply despite several on the team having much more experience than the man to whom we were told to report. All the leadership positions in this team are filled by men already, so there is no opportunity for women to advance. Women who left that team earlier said that the men on the team were similary promoted into their roles with no real opportunity for women to apply. One woman who spoke up about the situation are no longer with the company. Now the leader of this combined group has been telling the male leaders that he will be the new Vice President of Analytics. We dont have one of those. So it appears that yet another executive position has been minted and promised to a male with no opportunity for more experienced females to apply or be given access to the developmental leadership opportunities given to less experienced men.\r\n\r\nThat's why I titled this women need not apply. It sure looks like there  is a door through the glass ceiling into executive leadership at Intermountain, because they are constantly announcing men who have been appointed through it. But the lock onthe door apparently requires an XY chromosome pair. XX doesn't even get you an opportunity to apply.\r\n\r\nBefore this post gets buried by suspiciously brief rosy posts to bury it, I invite Intermountain's communication team to let us know how many many females applied for each of the leadership promotional opportunities mentioned here. I could very well be wrong. I hope we followed our policies and there were lots of women candidates and that somehow I am just missing every announcement about all the executive promotion opportunities."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Graphic Designer II", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Lead Designer in Salt Lake City, UT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Intermountain Healthcare is an industry-leading company with international recognition.
