However since Intermountain is king in Utah they essentially set what that mean is.  So they are basically able to keep pay low and artificially deflate the average that they aim to match.  If you go to one of the other healthcare systems in Utah you will get a significant amount more per hour.   Also they used to tout that the benefits made up for the pay, but i don\u2019t think employees feel that is true anymore.  \n- Declining culture of intermountain at large: You probably get the picture from all the other reviews.   Yes, we got a new CEO about a year ago and ever since it seems like there is less of a close-knit community feel to our hospitals and work environment.  Less respect and gratitude for front-line staff, less listening to employees, more micro-management, and more budget cuts that affect FTEs involved in direct patient care - which is a huge safety concern.  \n- Declining culture within Pharmacy: There has been huge trickle down in the Declining culture and morale from CEO Marc Harrison to the Pharmacy departments.  It feels like this started before he came, but the more rapid rate of decline has been felt by everyone since his arrival.  It\u2019s total mixed signals when management talks about championing advancing Pharmacy roles and commitment to medication and patient safety, yet the actions being taken are in direct opposition to these goals.  \n- \u201cBenchmarking\u201d. Ugh.  What a disgusting buzz word that is right now.  In keeping with the mixed signals mentioned above, Pharmacy upper management wants us to be first in class, yet they \u201cbenchmark\u201d our FTEs to hospitals in other states that don\u2019t provide the same services or level of care that intermountain Pharmacy has been doing.  And then FTEs get cut because we are benchmarked against these lower-level hospitals? If you want world class care, it\u2019s going to take a  World class budget and staffing.  \n- Everything is being micro-managed from a corporate level in ways that don\u2019t make sense.  Some standardization is good and has made huge improvements; however everything is being needled and nit-picked from high rise towers and upper management is seeming more and more out of touch.  Why have Pharmacy directors if you are going to micro manage daily operations, staffing, FTEs, budgets, inventory operations, etc etc?  There is some great talent in lower level management at some sites but their ability to run things or make decisions seems almost non-existent now.  \n- Declining employee appreciation: The presence of being asked to do more with less has reached extreme levels.  Some sites have pharmacy teams that band together and buoy each other up, but Some sites have cut-throat, toxic cultures of throwing coworkers under the bus.  We are highly motivated, highly educated healthcare professionals and yet feel like we are being treated without respect or appreciation.  The pharmacy department is losing great talent left and right.  Recent implementation of standardized work schedules across the system that make no sense have really thrown people over the edge.  Local hospitals have FTEs and budgets - Let them figure out the scheduling that makes most sense for their site within these parameters.  Also when you implement huge changes that grossly affect the details of people\u2019s lives you should be sensitive to that fact and recognize the human factor in what you\u2019re doing.  You can be transparent about the why and let people know you appreciate that you are turning their personal lives upside down with ridiculously short notice. \n- It feels crazy to have gone into a profession where you are highly educated, residency trained, committed to the intermountain values and feel so demeaned, belittled, and unappreciated from upper management.

It is obvious most people do not see beyond their propaganda. They love and fiercely defend their \u2018not-for-profit\u2019 status and don't pay any corporate taxes. They spend tons of money to promote an image of philanthropy and caring to overshadow and distract the public from their real agenda. As long as they spend all profits, there is no tax liability. Therfore, they have millions to spend on advertising, bonuses, expansion, lobbying and reinforcing their grip as the primary health organization. A significant portion of profits go to bonuses for employees, the lions share to upper management. Bonuses are closely tied to coming under department budget. To qualify for bonuses, managers are motivated to staff at minimal levels and curtail equipment upgrades and maintenance. Staff medical caregivers often find themselves in difficult, stressful and debilitating positions. Predominantly sacrificing their own well-being to preserve quality of patient care. However, no matter how dedicated they are to putting on the required show of 'caring' and 'making you feel safe', it is hard for them to completely hide the frustration. Nobody in administration really cares at all! Contrary to common belief, the institution\u2019s business practices are every bit as ruthless as \u2018for-profit\u2019 health companies', if not more so. The enviroment of caring mantra is just a well orchestrated facade. Next time you are in one of their hospitals as a patient or a concerned visitor, closely observe the conditions staff members work under. Next time you meet a competing clinic or associated vendor, ask them how hard-nosed they are to do business with. The true priorities are basically in this order: Money, Image, Market Dominance, Patient Care, and Avoiding Liability. Employee security and well-being are at rock bottom! The truth is often an unwelcome visitor.
