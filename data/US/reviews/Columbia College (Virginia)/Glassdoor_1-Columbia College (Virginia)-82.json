They have you create syllabi, but in the middle of the semester, they will put students in your class. I realized they accept anyone just to make money. This random appearance of new students makes it difficult for teachers who are following a syllabus. None of the book materials ever arrive on time. I do a lot of outside work, but because the school is so unorganized, the students are frustrated, and they often take it out on the teachers. They don't tell you in the beginning that the majority of your students are Afghan refugees in crisis, many of them know very little English nor do they know how to use computers very well. This makes it nearly impossible to teach them."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "don't work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 May 2023", "job_title": "Program Assistant in Vienna, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "some coworkers are nice and kind.", "cons": "no benefits, less payrate, lack of leadership"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst ever", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous/Employee in Vienna, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "none if you look for any", "cons": "small salary and very fraud executives"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great students, horrible management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Instructor in Tysons Corner", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I've worked in ESL education for many years and quickly got a job at Columbia College after moving to the area. They are always hiring thanks to incredibly high turnover, because they don't really give employees any reason to stay. The pros are that if you're looking for a job right away, Columbia College always has class hours available. ESL classes have a diverse mix of adult learners who are overall really motivated, kind, and all-around great students! Textbooks are provided but instructors generally have wide discretion over teaching methods.", "cons": "Management is horrible. If you've ever worked for this kind of company before, you'll recognize the way nothing is planned, everything is in panic mode, and mistakes are always the fault of the next person down. It's a very strict top-down structure that is more focused on making money and grabbing new students than on listening to teachers and current students about how to develop better programs. Employees are treated more like tools than people. It's not as bad for American staff, but especially for Korean workers or foreign students (i.e. anyone needing visa sponsorship from the school), it's extremely exploitative. The school offers absolutely no benefits whatsoever, no paid time off, no paid prep. Teachers are required to attend unpaid professional development. There is no way to be \"full time,\" even if you're teaching all day, every day -- every instructor is an adjunct to cut costs. If you are looking to support yourself off this job, even teaching a full schedule, you'll be disappointed."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Student Admission Assistant", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Arlington, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Help the community to achieve better education level", "cons": "Not a good place to learn and learn"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Admission Officer in Vienna, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice location nice building and parking", "cons": "Pay is low, management is poor, no growth opportunity"}], [], [], [], []]
