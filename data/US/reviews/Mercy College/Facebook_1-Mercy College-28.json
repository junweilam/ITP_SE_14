Do not be fooled!  If you work in departments that require student contact, you will be expected to work most weekends and some holidays (including Winter/Christmas break). Some employees who are not unionized consistently work more than 35 hours a week (thats all we get paid for) and are not given compensated time.  Generally speaking, only if an employee works on the weekend will they be granted a day off in exchange. Also, most....let me repeat most employees have more than one job.  For example in a traditional higher ed institution if you worked in student activities that would be your sole job responsibility.  You may be assigned other tasks related to student activities but that would be it.  At Mercy it is not uncommon for most employees who are responsible for student activities or other jobs that are traditionally one person's job to also have a full student caseload and are responsible for that students with academic advising, career counseling, admin reporting, etc. responsibilities.\r\n2) High turnover - Obviously based on what I stated above you can understand why this occurs.  Unfortunately this creates an unpleasant work environment, similar to that of a prision, where everyone comisserates and whispers about the things they are going to do when they \"get out\" and get a better job.\r\n3) No respect for life outside of work - Once again you are almost expected to work beyond the 35 hrs a week you are paid for. (Just to be clear it is not uncommon to work from 9AM to 7PM on a daily basis in order to get all of your work done.) If you do not you are viewed as an employee who is \"not dedicated\" to the college and it will become difficult for you to get promoted, even if the work you produce is stellar.  Often times college events and other projects are thrust upon you at the last minute forcing you make adjustments to your personal life to accomodate work.  This includes holidays, often times non-unionized employees are given short notice (1 month or less)  and have to change Labor Day and other weekend plans. \r\n4) The administration rules Mercy with an iron fist, similar to a dictatorship - Keep your opinions to yourself or face the consquences of being labeled a \"difficult\" employee or one who does not have a \"positive\" attitude."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poorly Run", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Yorktown Heights, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome coworkers that made it bearable.", "cons": "Worked in the Student Services Support Department, where we were expected to work in a call-center like setting while also serve as advisors, financial aid assistants, and Admissions counselors for little pay.
