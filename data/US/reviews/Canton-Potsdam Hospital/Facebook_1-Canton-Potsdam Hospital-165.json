Nurses have always been expected to go above and beyond for their employers. In fact, to be viewed as a \"medium performer\" you have to do things that aren't listed in your job description. CPH continues this tradition of treating nurses poorly. Everything they do just screams, \"be thankful you have a job.\" This seeps down from management, to the nurses. Management truly doesn't keep the patients in mind. I have seen the laziest nurses be given awards. Literally an award given to nurses who lack technical abilities, are lazy, and eat the newer nurses. There a lot of talk about, \"these young nurses don't have a good work ethic.\" The people saying these things constantly leave work to be done, leave meds for the next shift, and don't chart properly. Then they earn an award. Ther is something to be said for being in the nursing profession for 30 years. However, that shouldn't mean that you don't have to do the same amount of work as someone who's been doing it for 10 or fewer years. The allowable level of backbiting is amazing. For example - people have been reprimanded for Posting on Facebook, \"Busy night at work. Why doesn't management realize we need more staff!\" Mind you these posts were done not during the work shift. What right does management have to do this? When I left they wanted to do an exit interview. It was a total sham because the only question asked was, \"Why are you leaving?\" It was because I was moving. When I tried to elaborate the person conducting the exit interview said, \"thanks that's enough.\" They didn't listen to me say I was moving because I didn't want to work at CPH any more. The North Country has limited employment opportunities and the thought of being stuck at CPH for life drove me out of the area. In the past 5-6 years all of the good staff has scattered."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Too many cooks in the kitchen.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Clerical in Potsdam, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I loved the people I worked with day by day.

The lead recruiter is incredibly petty and if you have ever wronged her in any way at any point in your life, she with make sure that none of the hiring managers ever see your resume. Your best bet to get in the company is hang out at the bars in Massena, as that is where the recruiter spends all of her time not at work. Befriend her and you are on easy street.  If you want to move up the ranks, you really need to have a friend on the inside. Working hard and hoping management notices is wasted effort. Hiring managers prefer to hire from outside the company, so \"getting your foot in the door\" doesn't really help. And each manager does things so differently, you need to be careful. One may love your initiative, and the other might prefer you to stay in your lane. Too often we see new people walk in and take a high paying job while there are people just as qualified inside the company already who are ignored.  Hiring managers have no real accountability and don't have to justify their hiring practices to anyone, but seeing it over and over again is just demoralizing. We have temps who are here every day working hard but the permanent positions are going to outsiders who have family and friends in administration. There are unions here, but not for all jobs, and the ones that are there, HR knows how to get around doing things by the rules. If you live in the area and can get in and get benefits, great.
