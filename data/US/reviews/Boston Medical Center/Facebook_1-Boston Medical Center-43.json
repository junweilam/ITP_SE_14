There isn't a culture overall at the hospital and most clinics are always busy, which is great! but when you depend on management to complete your work is a disaster and you leave work stress and overworked. I constantly saw my coworkers stress levels very high and management did nothing about it. Also, we always were very short staff because people will quit within months leaving everyone with more extra work and constant covering. Management once told us that we needed to get out of minds that we were short staff and that we could do it all. Another thing that disappointed me was that management expected perfection and zero room for mistake,  but never did properly train us because they never seemed to have time. If you were doing mistakes management will never let you know but instead will arrange meeting with the union to put pressure and give you warnings about losing your job. There are many more other things about BMC that were beyond disappointment.
