The breakdown internally has separated the organization from the well-respected and visible key leaders of the national autism community and has dismantled the relationships the charity so closely depends on from ground fundraisers and advocates. The CoFounders will have some serious apologies to make if they don't recognize these issues soon; or if not, they must be totally willing to surrender their own well-earned reputation along with the organization completely. \r\n\r\nFor two years now there has been a widening hole in the bucket with the organization losing so much talent, that it's impossible to justify by Feld. She constantly points, implies and blames all lack of progress to 'deeply rooted' disorganization and lack of skill among employees-- it's a slap in the face to the early vision of the organization and makes mission delivery impossible.\r\n\r\nThe current development strategy in place is theoretical and over-speculated with no real proof that it drives revenue- the leadership literally pulls articles out of the NY Times as evidence of their fundraising ideas. \r\n\r\nNepotism aside (a significant amount of her executive staff comes from her and her husband's network), the leadership currently hired to be responsible for strategy and development refuses sound advice and declines to employ professionals with the experience to at least give design to poorly conceived fundraising ideas.\r\n\r\nThe company is also in desperate need for an operations framework. Evaluating success is impossible-- their practices at financial analysis is weak as is the integrity of their data. For Feld's entire tenure the organization has delayed applying for fundraising licenses, applied for extensions to file their 990 with the IRS, and has published their annual reports late. It's Nov 2014-- and the 2013 annual report is only now being produced. \r\n\r\nFinally, if the strategy of the organization was intended to build a lobby and magnify their media presence...then what has happened with the attention from big press?\r\n\r\nFeld's issues with communications is completely three dimensional. Externally, she struggles with connecting to the community, and I would describe her prone to incitement and riot. This is more alarming than all her posturing and exhibition-- when 'off stage' she is detached and aloof and simply lacks compassion towards families of the community. In large forums, her stage presence is forced and stern; she stumbles to articulate key facts from the org's own research department, depending on boiler plates and becoming repetitive and insistent. What are we working towards if this is how she communicates?\r\n\r\nInternally, she lacks any vertical communication. Department goals are not clear and always changing. Furthermore, Feld models inappropriate behavior towards her suite that has nurtured a hostile work environment with subordinates. The general good humor and energy among middle and junior staff is gone and it seems Feld is in constant ideological battle. Staff are nervous, confused, browbeaten and simply...exiting. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure, given her resume in community politics and children's media, what this woman is searching for-- but the organization would be better off without a rogue Tinman hacking away at everything with his hatchet just to find his heart."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Fundraising", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Leaders with fundraising experience were great -understood initiatives that would work in the field and how to connect with families", "cons": "Leaders from the for-profit world struggled to understand autism dynamics and did not respect the years of history of folks throughout the organization"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Dysfunctional in the western part of the USA", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing volunteers, kind hard-working employees, interesting events, groundbreaking research funding, awesome advocacy team, fun national partnerships.", "cons": "Resources spread too thin, staff overworked, high staff turnover, poor use of donations, lack of consistency, low low low low low pay"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The Epitome of Hostile Work Environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is satisfying to help families affected by autism.", "cons": "In the last 2 years the culture of bullying has become pervasive.
