Currently, I am a lecturer at West Chester University of Pennsylvania and I have been an instructor and teaching assistant for several courses in the Computer Science and Mathematics departments and a research assistant during my graduate studies at the University of Texas at Arlington.\r\nMy current research is in the area of hierarchical reinforcement learning applied to Computer Games and Robotics. I have introduced a new method for a fast discovery of subgoals using Monte Carlo sampling. I have applied this method for construction of hierarchical action and state representations in reinforcement learning in order to accelerate learning and extend the scope of such systems. The main result of these techniques is to permit the transference of knowledge to subsequent tasks and acceleration of learning by creating corresponding subtask policies as abstract actions.\r\nImportant features of my background are my graduate and professional levels of experience in re- search, industries and teaching fields, where I maintained an open-minded and non-conservative approach to new problems and new ideas. Because teaching and research have an important place in my career goals, I have obtained a significant experience in both fields.\r\nAmong the most satisfying experiences for me have been my professional services such as recruit- ment of prospective students and participation in several volunteer activities for programming contests and science fairs. These activities have encouraged high school students to think about Computer Science as a possible university career and I plan to continue these activities at the department, university and regional levels.\r\nI feel confident that my extensive interdisciplinary training and experience in major areas of Computer Science and Engineering will support my development of being well-published, well- funded and well-known in the scientific community through innovative research and teaching activities in your respected department.\r\nEnclosed please find my research and teaching statements, my curriculum vitae and a list of my references.
