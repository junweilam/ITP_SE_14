They treat you as if you just committed murder no matter which issue.\r\n\r\nMost people from nursing management and above have little to no clinical or bedside experience.  So, they have no idea how to relate or support their staff when there is a\"problem\".  What I find hilarious is that these are the same people who encourages you to get your certifications, do projects and get your Master's, etc.  Why? So they can take credit for YOUR work. How? Because not only will they look good to the rest of management, it will also look fantastic for \"Magnet\".

I had three different positions, each one a sort of promotion from the last.  I rose up pretty quickly. If you are intelligent and hard working, you can do it. It's not difficult.  Salary rose with each position.", "cons": "Where to start?  I worked on the administrative side, so this has nothing to do with clinical or research. I also want to stress that I did not have have any issues with any doctors while working here, only the administrative side! 1)  I hated the cliques; the gossip; the fact that it's all educated middle aged women with children who stayed there for the benefits (and I am aware of the hypocrisy of this statement, as a woman, but just thinking about hospital administration brings me back to the person that I was and don't want to be.). The workers could have done something else, could have followed their dreams, but chose not to.  I didn't hate the people in general, I hated that they were all miserable there, and took it out on each other, which made everyone even more miserable.  It seemed like they were all out to get each other for some reason. Shouldn't we all work together?! They were happy with salary and benefits, but it was just an unpleasant work culture.  This isn't a dream job or a career, this is a paycheck until retirement.  No administrative job is a career, unless you are really high up on the totem pole.  Yet none of the people I worked with strived to get to the top, they strived to get to 5pm...  2) I did the job of my supervisor in all three jobs.  As a supervisor now, I understand the difficulties in a supervisory role (too much work, ability to delegate, being approachable, etc..), but this was a bit ridiculous.  I know exactly what each of my supervisors were supposed to do because I did all of their work on top of my own work.  Instead, knowing that they have an assistant, they took 3 hour lunches, dumped work on me, and expected me to stay late while they left early.  You can either manage or you can't, and these three could obviously not.  It got to the point that when I left, the person who had taken my last position at NYU contacted me asking if it was just them, of if the supervisor actually didn't do their job.  They stay in easy managerial roles for years, knowing that they probably won't get fired.  NYU doesn't fire incompetent people (con #4), meanwhile losing competent assistants every 6-8 months, who have gotten much better and much more interesting jobs elsewhere (i.e. left to follow their dreams, like I did).  Not all of the managers are this way, there are wonderful ones! Just the ones that I directly worked with were incapable of doing their jobs.  But, the fact that I had all three of my mangers be this way, statistically says to me that there are more bad managers than good ones.  One manager actually said to me that she is \"not a micro-manager\", but, then, was given a task by her manager, handed it to me, and just sat over my shoulder by my desk and commented while I completed the task.  This was all day every day that I worked in that position.  3) Is this really anyone's dream job?  No, this really is a paycheck with benefits.  It's paperwork, answering phones, and making sure you smile 8 hours a day doing mindless tasks. It's important work. Seriously and sarcastically. Without hospital administration there would be no hospitals (i.e. credentialing and licensing is key to even having a doctor see patients; organizing lectures and other events helps educate doctors more and advance in their fields; and having an administrative buffer basically leaves doctors alone to do their jobs, which is patient care or research to advance patient care!) It's easy work if you are competent, as I feel most (NOT ALL) are. There are people that do this, and do this well and put in 1000%, realizing how important it is. Being surrounded by people like that is encouraging and makes work worthwhile. However, most people at NYU are not like that. This job was not for me.

Nurses who were training or hired to be on ICU floors were suddenly being told they would be shifted to non-ICU floors after weeks of speculation and rumors. Ironically, many of these same nurses ended up being recalled back to the ICU months later because of poor staffing ratios, worsening patient outcomes, and increased pressure placed on nurse managers from disgruntled nurses. Throughout all of this, we only heard from upper management every once in a while. \r\n\r\n- I personally disliked working at the new Kimmel Pavilion. While it has great patient amenities and operating rooms, the layout of this enormous building makes it difficult to find help or devices. Unlike in Tisch where you could easily look into the hallway to request help, Kimmel's enormous hallways and dispersed nursing stations make it difficult to see anyone. It sometimes takes walking an entire lap around the building to find a single device. Camaraderie amongst staff is also affected because you rarely get to work next to the same person longer than 2 days in a row. You might be working at one nursing station one day and then the opposite side of the building the next.\r\n\r\n- This may be more of a culture issue, but I frequently saw travel nurses grow frustrated at the lack of collaboration between providers and nurses here. Travel nurses with close to 10 years of experience have reported getting their opinions or suggestions dismissed because they were newcomers. I've also experienced my fair share of negative, dismissive interactions with PA's and MD's that led to me escalating to my manager. Certain protocols regarding medicines and procedures are also more tightly regulated here, causing travel nurses to feel like they have less \"autonomy\" compared to other hospitals."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Food & Nutrition Department", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Overall NYU Langone provides good work-life balance, strong leadership development and growth opportunities, good culture and team collaboration.

Add to that the fact that is the most miserable human being I've ever encountered, and this all makes for a pretty awful work environment. He deliberately cultivates an environment of fear and misery, and seems to go out of his way to make all of his underlings (that's a very deliberate noun choice) feel insignificant and in constant fear for their jobs. I regularly had coworkers come to me in tears, devastated with the way he had publicly berated them for some perceived error (very often, his own error!), deliberately embarrassed them in front of their coworkers and/or managers, and belittled and screamed at them for no apparent reason. Scarcely a day passed that I didn't actively deal with personnel issues of his needless creation.\r\n- This department is very underfunded, so there are constantly promises made about imminent increases in staff, resources, and support that NEVER materialize.\r\n-The department is also terribly understaffed, so one person regularly does the job of 5-7 people, and zero appreciation is expressed, no matter how hard you work.\r\n- The morale in this office is the lowest I've ever experienced, and any attempts to raise morale are treated as hostile threats to the management. May employees frequently commiserated over what a miserable environment it was.\r\n-As is commonplace in many academic environments, it is nearly impossible to implement any real change, as management likes to say, \"well this is the way we've always done it,\" no matter how unsuccessful the results.

When something is told to them in private, by the time you get back to your desk, the whole office already knows about it.  HR says they have your back, but they just email the manager and tells them that such and such employee contacted HR and the situation is sent back to the manager to again, \"not\" deal with it!!!
