CVICU and CCU are bizarre mixed acuity units that can be very unfulfilling if you want the challenge of ICU. If you\u2019re a telemetry or cardiac step down nurse, you also have to do ICU here which stresses a lot of people out who would be wonderful acute care nurses but don\u2019t want the stress of having ICU patients as well. Travel nurses hate their lives here. The hospital hires them for the float pool and they\u2019re thrown all over the place. Most are ICU nurses but when floated to the \u201cICUs\u201d they usually get acute patients because the unit gives the ICU patients to their staff. A lot of nurse practitioners can be toxic and don\u2019t know how to educate the bedside nurses without being condescending. Unfortunately it\u2019s the same everywhere and not NYU specific.
