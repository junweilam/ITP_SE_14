If SSM expanded into this state, I would immediately go back with them for many reasons. I didn't realize how great they were until I had another medical system for comparison.

I feel like the older nurses do not care for my safety and frequently walk away from threatening situations.

Sadly, it has ultimately been much easier for many of my now former co-workers to gain advancement by leaving SSM for one of the competitors, which of course contributes to the high-turnover ratio.

I do that all of the time!\" I taught her, (patiently) that she was opening the patient up to infection, and another IV stick due to the improper handling of that line, and that the tubing, antibiotics, and fluids would all need to be replaced.

Scheduling was done from St. Louis, therefore the scheduling personnel sometimes didn't have a full picture of things going on in the OKC branch. For example, if I were asked to go into the office to have a meeting, the St. Louis scheduling team didn't know this and continued to schedule a full day. They also had no idea the areas in which a nurse worked so would schedule patients all over the map and expect you to be able to see a full day. The expectations were unrealistic. The point system for productivity was unrealistic. 2 points for admits, with McKesson charting. The nurse was responsible for the entire admission, the F2F, the 485 and running the admit though SHP and completing any changes, which took days. On call working weekends was every other weekend and at times, would have 4 admits on a Saturday and 3-4 on a Sunday. This was expected to be an 8 hour day on top of driving all around. They never looked at your actual schedule for realistic hours. Then, questioned any overtime. There was one team lead that was an advocate and do what she could to assist the nurses, but upper management didn't allow much wiggle room. If you didn't have the 6 points needed for a full day, they would automatically assign extra things to you without considering mileage. Mileage was not looked at at all. Once was required to go to a 2 hour meeting and also still see 6 points while driving over 100 miles that day. Meetings in office not considered in work day at all. Most of the other staff were miserable as well but voiced that they loved their patients and had been there so long they didn't want to leave. Management changed within last 2 years and a lot of things went down hill.  Staff would try to voice complaints during different meetings and were told to take it to management. \r\nI constantly was home charting after working 8 hours, never ending job.  \r\nOverall, worst job experience."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Coding Specialist", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "SSM Health is a non-profit hospital that truly believes in caring for the sick, regardless of ability to pay and puts their patients first.
