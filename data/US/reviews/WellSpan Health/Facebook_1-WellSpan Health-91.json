There's barely an attempt to hide the full-on revenue focus niw. \"Non-Profit\" in name only. \n\nTherapists are not trusted with clinical judgment or caseload management. LEAN has been embraced as the holy grail to replace those professional skills: Centralized services that can't recognize and respond to individualized needs, standard work processes written for everything, zero control of your own schedules, so clients, now called \"patients\", are crammed in back-to-back every 45 minutes to \"maximize RVUs\" (expect to have 12+ sessions a day). Caseload flow is (un)managed to an untenable capacity, resulting in compromised quality of care for clients. Session length was shortened from 45 minutes to 40 minutes...still the same billing code and allows them to squeeze another session into your workday. Concurrent Documentation is policy so you don't need time outside of sessions to document. \n\nEpic for EMR...death by 1000 clicks! Even worse, because it's primary use is medical, behavioral health had to adapt its own standard language to use medical language. When both fields happen to share a particular word or phrase that have different meanings or applications, the medical one was adopted in the EMR and the behavioral health language was changed to something else that often seemed like an IT person made it up on the fly. \n\nA new \"innovative\" Pillars of Care structure was adopted for Outpatient Services that now requires clients to travel to one of two locations for an intake (York or Ephrata) and then engage in Transitional Care (therapy groups), until an individual therapist becomes available. There's little-to-no acknowledgement of what a client may have said they wanted and needed when they sought care. \nLEAN it is...like a Ford assembly line. There's so much more. But, the bottom-line is that, if you want a hamster-wheel job, work here. If you want a meaningful, fulfilling profession, don't."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Good Weekend Package", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Lebanon, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wellspan has good insurance and their weekend packages are great", "cons": "The usual politics of hospitals"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work- minus a couple of nuances", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Psych RN in Mount Gretna, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great mission.
