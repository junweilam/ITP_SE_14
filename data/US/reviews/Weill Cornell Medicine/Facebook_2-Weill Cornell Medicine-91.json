This is a sales position for the All of Us research program (please google). Leadership, training, and management are completely absent. Management is rarely seen, but when she is get ready for intimidation techniques; her super power was sending threatening emails. The turnover rate is extremely high. Within 6 months, 5-6 people quit or were fired. The most senior patient research coordinator had been there about 8 months. This left us with a team of all new employees, with no training, and no leadership. One example is the phlebotomy. We were \"trained\" by sticking each other with needles 3 times, and once successful, you could work on patients! All in all, this job is selling the All of Us research program, which is remarkably similar to a scam. Performance is fully based off of the call center. Making calls makes up 70-80% of the job, which you are never told until you begin. This was a waste of time in the scope of my career in clinical research. No relevant skills are learned or obtained, and there is very little opportunity for growth. Please be wary, there are other entry opportunities in the field. I know it's difficult, but you can find a suitable position that will help you grow as a CRC.

I have been in Weill Cornell for over 6 years I started as a Patient Coordinator (2015) then got promoted to a Sr. Patient Coordinator (2017). I had a child and once you become a parent life changes happen out of the blue, Weill Cornell management were great in making accommodations with my work schedule. My supervisor even referred me to Lower Manhattan, which is just 25 min away from my home and this helped so much! The transfer was actually a promotion to Sr. Medical Secretary at LMH, the supervisor is also amazing and so understanding. Now I am currently going through some other life changes which I will need to relocate and being a single parent, it will be hard for me to look for child care in a place where you do not know anyone at all. With all the craziness going on with babysitters harming children you just don't trust anyone. So, I knew my best option would be to find a job where I can work from home, I applied to a few companies since I thought Weill Cornell did not have work from home opportunities. When I spoke to my supervisor and told her that I have been hired to work for another company she was devastated. And at that same moment without telling me she referred me to another supervisor whom did have work from home opportunities within Weill Cornell!!!! The job I had gotten hired for had horrible benefits in which were too expensive and I found myself having to apply to government health plans. So, This is something that I am so grateful for, now I can keep all my benefits and still work at Cornell. I took my time to write this review because I never thought that I was valued this much at work, and this will show prospective employees the true meaning and the outcomes of being hard working and dedicated to your job. Apart from that you form a strong bond with your co-workers, we are all a family here and I am grateful to be part of Weill Cornell!", "cons": "*You have to deal with a lot of difficult patients.\n*Heavy work load\n***But it's all worth it!***"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Director of Education in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good time off and benefits", "cons": "Not sure what to say"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Apr 2022", "job_title": "PhD Graduate Student in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice location\nample study spaces\ncaring administrative staff", "cons": "complex bureaucracy\nacademia in general"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Amazing place to work and grow", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Director, Research Administration in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "WCMC has culture that values and supports unique qualities and skillsets of its employees. it is a great place to grow professionally.", "cons": "located in a center of a large city - it is not an easy commute if you have to be in office.

The department of medicine hires uneducated temps, and the uneducated temps starts gossip and trouble among the new employees, why? Because the temps want the new employees jobs. It seems as though management likes the gossip too. It is suppose to be about the patients and not this cutthroat I want your job kind of thing.  Next to this department is OB/GYN and their management team seems to know how to run their staff and new employees. It all depends on who you work with, and which department. Weill Cornell should have gotten rid of all New York Downtown bad seeds. The Department of Medicine is unorganized!!! The management sucks, supervisors do not want to deal with hostile patients, supervisors do not know what they are doing. Wait, but get this, The Department of Medicine staff are Patient Coordinators, and GYN staff are Senior Patient Coordinators(both have same years of experience & degrees).  Medicine staff does more work than GYN, and get paid less. Basically, it is the same job function, but in this case The Department of Medicine\u2019s Patient Coordinators are doing a lot more work at 156 Williams Street (Cheap Bastards). Whatever you do, do not work at 156 Williams Street, Department of Medicine.

You are treated like just another number, not a human being. You constantly have to deal with angry patients, day in and day out, yelling at you for things you have no control over. We as patient coordinators have to take the brunt of EVERYTHING for our department, not the doctors. We have to put up with being yelled at, and complained to, and degraded, on a daily basis.
