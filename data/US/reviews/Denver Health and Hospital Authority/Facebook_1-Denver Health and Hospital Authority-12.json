I happened to be hired in right before a major re-org, and it went all down hill from there.  \r\n\r\nAttrition was a major in issue in just about every department.  For the past couple of years, there was a massive exodus of knowledge and talent.  It seems that a big reason for this is lack of advancement opportunities, and overwhelming top performers with lots of additional work with little or no reward.  It think there was something like 30-40% attrition in the health plan over the past couple of years at all levels and across the org.\r\n\r\nCareer opportunities were severely lacking during my tenure with the health plan.  Management had no problem piling on more work and giving you more responsibilities.  But when it came time for seeking advancement, there were always excuses for why it wasn't the right time for you.  It seemed to be easy to get in, but it was impossible to move up.  Management seems to be more focused on hiring from the outside than promoting from the inside.  As a result, I've seen a lot of people leave, and some will even come back years later when they are hired into better positions than they left.\r\n\r\nSilos/backstabbing and poor operational planning was some of the worst I've ever experienced with an organization.  I think it's a result of teams being overwhelmed and understaffed due to lack of resources.  So when they don't get work done, there is a bunch of finger pointing and blaming of other groups for not contributing,  Sometimes the criticisms were valid, but much of the time it was excuse making for poor planning and even worse execution.\r\n\r\nI made some really good connections with the company, but I also observed and experienced some of the worst backstabbing in all of my years of experience.  People incessantly talk about others behind their backs, usually nitpicking and criticizing their work ethic or attitudes regardless of whether there is any truth or data to back it up.  I know this probably happens a lot more than I'm typically aware, but it really contributed to a negative culture.  You really didn't know who you could trust, and you never knew if someone was talking about you behind your back for no apparent rhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nThe upside is that a lot of the \"old timers\" have left or are being pushed out.  Due to all the turnover, lots of new blood have entered the ranks, and I actually think this is the best possible outcome for the organization.  Much of the negativity and animosity and backstabbing have left or will leave with the continued attrition of those who've been there too long.   As long as senior management handles the onboarding of new staff well enough, they can help create and cultivate a more positive culture within the organization.\r\n\r\nBottom line for me is that it was really bad timing to join the organization when I did, and I eventually dealt with as much of the chaos as I could before jumping ship.  I was hired on by managers with bad reputations, and those reputations seemed to rub off and stick with their legacy staff members.  In the end, I realized I never had a chance with this org, and was set up for failure (unintentionally) from the very beginning.  \r\n\r\nI really hope the best for DHMP.  Despite my bad experience, I learned a lot and met and worked with some really good people.   Management seems to have brought in some really good people in the last six months.  I hope that they treat them well enough to retain them so that the culture continues to improve and the knowledge and experience stays with the company so that groups aren't in a perpetual state of rebuilding."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Denver Health", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Aug 2010", "job_title": "Paramedic in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very busy systems.

I am not posting this not to dissuade future employees or to intentionally defame, but rather as somebody who sees Denver Health as family and is trying everything they can to put an end to the treatment my family is being subjected to. \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere throughout the hospital deteriorated throughout the last few years of my employment. It seemed to begin with the acquisition of our new CEO. For example, under the previous CEO's leadership, Dr. Gabow, the LEAN system of DH was one of the best. Employees constantly took on personal projects to help save money. Rapid improvement events were always ongoing to eliminate waste and improve productivity. The staff were challenged and encouraged to take on projects of their own. DH was in the black for several years. Not too bad for the safety net hospital! Employee attitudes were mostly positive. DH was a sought after hospital to work for by those who had a passion for medicine and a passion to help others. Those who only wanted a paycheck by doing the least amount of work possible generally didn't last long. DH didn't buy a certificate showing off that they were one of the best. Didn't need to. It was common knowledge throughout the industry and it showed.  \r\n\r\nShortly after changing CEO's, LEAN projects quickly went from an every day occurrence to only a memory. The head of LEAN abruptly retired shortly after staff projects ceased. Lean still exists today as a class offered to the public for a fee to obtain LEAN certification, but it is no longer a functioning entity within the hospital. \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere changed. We were given larger workloads and more paperwork. Our jobs were constantly threatened by our micromanaging leadership. Computers are slow with clunky charting software that required so much time patient care suffered. Management wasn't concerned about how we cared for our patients, we were being watched to see if we crossed our t's and dotted our i's. Patients were ignored. Patient safety was compromised. Why? Because we had to become a \"Magnet\" hospital. \r\n\r\nAbout halfway through my career at DH money became tight. Our previous CEO, instead of imposing job cuts chose to stop yearly raises until things got better. The staff mostly accepted this and things eventually improved. At least nobody was laid off. Then our new CEO took over, cut the biggest money saving program we had in LEAN, and just a little over a year into his position announced 300 job cuts. \r\n\r\nSome valuable employees were fired for nonsense reasons. Colorado is a right to work state and employers don't need a reason to terminate. However, if an employee loses their job under no fault of their own, they can file for unemployment benefits and their former employer gets taxed. If they are terminated for being at fault, no benefits. I'm not saying veteran employees were being terminated so DH could save some more money. What I do know is two friends were fired under silly circumstances. Both times Denver Health immediately appealed to stop their unemployment. Seems suspect to me.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, our new CEO would come to the A.V. room  so he could practice with his band that he formed under the Denver Health Foundation. There were two A.V. employees. He would take one to run his band equipment, doubling the workload of the other. The A.V. person who received the increased work load was not very happy on days when they were busy. It didn't matter to the CEO. I felt sorry for them. \r\n\r\nWe were too scared to do anything out of this fear they created. I'm not joking, it got to the point that I would act happy around anybody considered administration, avoid eye contact, and say very little strictly out of fear that they would find a reason to turn on me and that would be it.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to say how my career ended with DH. I am concerned about how my friends are being treated and something needs to be done. I still talk to many of my former co-workers on a daily basis and it hasn't gotten any better.\r\n\r\nGoogle the new CEO. He has an interesting history involving his being investigated for illegal financial practices. It's public record."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "This is a wonderful place to work!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Feb 2017", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, great pay, and the employees are fantastic!

When I was offered an opportunity to interview I was going skip the interview because I didn\u2019t get a good vibe from human resources that they were eager or excited like most human resource or recruiting departments typically are.  Reflecting back on this, I wish I would have skipped the interview.\r\n\r\nThe interview was with three people including manager and two other senior leadership members, including the CFO. In that interview, the position we spoke about was entirely different from the one that was outlined in the posting. At the time, the description of the job posting wasn\u2019t necessary something I wanted to do and instead, in our discussions, the job outlined in the interview was something I wanted to do and was eager to be offered the position. At the time they let me know I was going to report to one of the Associate CFO\u2019s. When I received a call that I got the position, I was super excited and of course like many other people I had questions. It wasn\u2019t until 2 days prior to my start date that I received an answer back to those questions and that I was now going to report to someone else in the department, one of which was in the interview. I decided to go with it, but that should have been another red flag of how disorganized and lack of communication on Denver Health\u2019s part.\r\n\r\nThe first week was very stressful learning all the new systems, colleagues, managers, directors, processes, policies, etc. When it came down to my day to day activities, it was the complete opposite from what we initially spoke about in the interview. It was also different from the posting. My job was for someone to refresh pivot tables and run simple SQL extracts which were something I mastered 10 years ago. When I brought this up to my manager she was very quick to belittle me and say I was wrong. Keep in mind this was two weeks in and she already raised her voice and talked down to me as if I was her child. I kept my cool and went back to my desk and started looking for a new job, even begged my previous employer if I could come back. I spent 8 months under my manager where I was constantly badgered, harassed, belittled, and treated like dirt. I was so upset that one day I went to her manager and he said he would look into it. Months went by and the behavior continued. While yes people may say, why didn\u2019t you have a discussion with your manager? I did. Did you talk back? No, I voiced my concerns with how I was being treated, but that didn\u2019t work. Come to find out after a few months, we hired another person in our department doing the same thing I do, but more senior level. It took three days for this individual to find out and it was actually refreshing to know it wasn\u2019t just me. Later on, fellow colleagues reached out to me asking how I could work for her, she is the reason why the other 4 people left, etc., etc. It wasn\u2019t much longer after that I just put in my two weeks\u2019 notice without even having a job lined up because I just couldn\u2019t take the harassment anymore. Some people would mention why didn\u2019t I go to HR? My counter to that is that the work environment was already bad enough, bringing in HR would have made it worse, so it was just best to leave. I left because I felt abandoned by the system put in place and I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone to work in these conditions. \r\nConclusion\r\nIf you get an interview or a job offer from Denver Health in the Financial Services department, steer clear. Just a warning because myself and the colleague mentioned above weren\u2019t the only two who had problems, it has been a revolving door per the words from colleagues in other departments. Every job I have had, I have loved who I worked for regardless if the job itself wasn\u2019t the greatest. It is called respect and Denver Health doesn\u2019t embody that trait."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Social worker", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "19 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Senior Clinical Social Worker in Charlotte, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Patient centered care.
