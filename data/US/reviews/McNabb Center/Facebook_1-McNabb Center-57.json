Productivity expectations are unrealistic and I have asked every supervisor, all the way up to the director of my program, for numbers that prove their expectations are attainable. Each time I have been told \"we don't have those numbers.\" They know they are wrong, but they don't care. They have had so many workers in crisis in the time that I have been in this program and all we can do is talk to one another because our crises go unheard by management. They don't care about employees, they don't care about clients, and they don't care about the Knoxville community. They care about a bottom line and ensuring they have a paycheck at the end of the day. We continue to have the same issues in our department and the supervisors continue to blame the workers instead of seeing that their productivity expectations are unattainable and inhumane.

Note: you have to redo these every year you work here. \r\n\r\nWeek 2 as Case Manager: this is when you realize how incredibly disorganized your direct supervisors are. They throw a bunch of forms at you that you will use in the field, take 5 minutes to explain them, and then make you shadow other case managers. The case managers will try to explain things to you but it's not going to help until you just do it on your own. \r\n\r\nOnce you work on your own, you quickly learn that 80% of your work will be chauffeurring clients. We case managers joke about how we're a \"glorified taxi service\". In other words, you'll immediately begin to wonder why this job requires a degree. Additionally, there are copious amounts of paperwork, so you need to manage your time very wisely (I will address this later).\r\n\r\nThe work, while rather simple, is very high stress because you'll have clients constantly calling to complain calling because they want you to do somethi g for them that is not in your job description. Then when you tell them you can't they'll yell at you. This job reqires a lot of patience and a high tolerance for stress. Several coworkers have had breakdowns, so this position is not for everyone.\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE/HOURS:\r\nThis position requires 40 hrs/week. Ideally you would work 8 to 5 with an hour for lunch, however, often you'll be busy with clients so you won't take a lunch, but you can be off work by 4 if that's the case. Management does not like you to skip lunch so you can't do this every day, but a few times a week is acceptable.  \r\n Management stresses to not work a second over 40 hours a week, if you do you will be reprimanded. This is the worst part of the job and I've seen many people be fired for this:\r\nYou're required to meet with clients 90 hours (\"productivity\") a month which, with the driving time, waiting on clients, and making calls will take up about 120 hours of your month. The paperwork takes a lot of time so you'll either lose productivity hours or you'll inevitably work overtime.  Most of us work overtime amd don't record it because you get reprimanded. So this is the lose-lose situation: your fired for working overtime or your fired for not getting your work done. The management has created a moral dilemma for their employees where we're all scared we'll lose our jobs if we don't omit the overtime we've worked on our timesheets.  \r\n\r\nPAY:\r\nTypically you're paid about 27,000 annually. Be aware, though, the job is advertised as salary on the posting and by the interviewer. This position IS NOT salary. You are paid $13 to $14 hourly so don't be fooled.  \r\n\r\nOTHER CONS:\r\n\r\n- your car will be ruined by all the driving you do (you do get reimbursed for mileage though)\r\n- bed bugs, lice, fleas can be picked up from clients and you'll be stuck with infestation in your car or home and Helen Ross will not pay for bed bug treatment if it gets in your home\r\n-Company is very political, people who are less quailified but friends with managers get the promotions.  Employees who are less liked on a personal basis by managers get singled out and disciplined, which is why you have to lay-low, keep your head down, and not ever speak up about problems with job or you will be fired."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "A Place to make a difference", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Services Coordinator in Chattanooga, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "As an organization HRMC is very serious about providing the best service possible for the client.
