When you interview, they make promises to get you through the door but reneges on the promises later. Also, if you leave the university before your anniversary, they will make you pay them back because of overpayment. I was never told about this. In fact, I found out because I did not receive my last check. I called payroll to inquire and they did not disburse me my check because I owed them money. Payroll told me they pay employees before they earn their pay which will cause a person to owe them money if they resign before their year anniversary. So, instead of getting my last paycheck, they took it without telling me and told me I owed them more money. Payroll collects on the overpayment as well as expecting you to make full payment within 10 days. I was told I could not use a credit card to pay.
