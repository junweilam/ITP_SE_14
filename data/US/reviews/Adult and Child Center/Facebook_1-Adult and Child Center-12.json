(I know I used to manage an IT department for several years, I know what they should and should not do.) They fake their knowledge and do anything to look good for upper leadership. On the outside they appear incredibly high functioning. They fired someone for writing \"blue lives matter\" in a place of almost no visibility. They fired another for simply being frustrated with leadership and unable to use his incredible talents to further the department, he was instead silenced. They tell you certain certifications are REQUIRED to move up in the company when some leadership have no certifications at all. They'd rather hire outside than promote. They hid that a certain member of Chief's watched adult content on his computer at work. They say things like \"maybe you should reconsider your career\" when asking about advice to move into the next role of the department up. When bringing up concerns one member of leadership actually said \"if you don't like it here you can go somewhere else\". One helpdesk guy talked to the CTO about taking time off for a new baby he was going to have. The CTO said \"of course, even though you won't have PTO you can absolutely take 2 weeks\" only then for him to have the baby at 2am and get a text at noon the same day saying \"where are you?\" (and after explaining he had a baby) \"If you're not in here before the end of this day, we will have to take appropriate disciplinary action\". The company implemented a flex schedule last year, It was too confusing for leadership so they just decided that the department doesn't get that benefit.

Documentation for time with these kids is separate but required so you'd better find a way to make it work. \r\n\r\nThey seem to have lots of hiring events. Then they hire a bunch of people and spend money and resources running them through the training program. Due to the constant stream of people being fired or resigning (all very civil like) they just put out some more job ads within 24 hours and spend more money to train more people $$$$, \r\n\r\nThere's no room for a learning curve outside of the first 8 weeks of training. Once you're out there you are expected to maintain or exceed the quotas. Having a bad day? Feeling ill? Snow day? Forced to attend a meeting? Too bad. You have to make your quotas regardless.  \r\n\r\nThis organization is run very much like a business despite the nonprofit tax status. I understand they need to make money. However, I often had to  push aside someone who needed help because I couldn't bill for my time with them.  I did hear they used to have slightly lower billing requirements which (on top of all of the documentation required for the job) would have made the job easier, but it seems every new thing they establish is designed to make more money. At some point they will become more FOR profit than NON profit.  It always made me feel like a cog in a machine. If I wanted to meet high metrics  I would have worked in the business world and made a heck of a lot more money doing it.  Often I felt like a sheep in wolf's clothing.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance and benefits are OK. They really push the high deductible plan but as I found out, it's not as great as they claim it is.  Salary is OK. No raises unless you are promoted to a manager position. Minor benefits to billing over the requirements which ultimately equals only a couple hundred dollars \"bonus\" each quarter. Incredibly high turnover rate. They asked us point blank if we have \"ever thought about quitting A&C\" and \"why?\" Their retention efforts seemed more like a weed out process of the \"weak\" ones who could defect."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Felt like an assembly line where the focus was on how many clients I saw daily & not on providing quality services.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Oct 2016", "job_title": "Therapist in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "\u2022Signing bonus & additional incentives (e.g. relocation expenses, student loan repayment, state and national dues paid yearly)\r\n\u2022Somewhat flexible schedule \r\n\u2022CEO makes an effort to know employees \r\n\u2022 camaraderie amongst coworkers", "cons": "\u2022Productivity requirement & unrealistic expectations\r\n\u2022Lack of consistency across the agency in terms of paperwork & procedures \r\n\u2022Lack of training \r\n\u2022Insufficient resources to perform job duties \r\n\u2022High stress level \r\n\u2022Low pay \r\n\u2022Lack of support and guidance \r\n\u2022Disconnect between management and front line employees \r\n\u2022Unethical practices \r\n\u2022Low office morale \r\n\u2022High turnover and numerous transitions"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "good for stepping stone or back up plan if nothing better is available but not designed for longevity", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, IN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.\tPay is very good compared to other agencies\r\n2.\tAccess to HSPP & MD\u2019s for feedback with interventions and treatment plans\r\n3.\tThe online training program that the agency uses Relias provides opportunity for free CEU continuing education units accessible at any time which is good for licensed clinical mental health staff and medical staff that need CEU\u2019s to keep up with their license", "cons": "1.\tOffice politics leads to back stabbing , micromanagement\r\n2.\tEgos of many staff office hinders quality of work.
