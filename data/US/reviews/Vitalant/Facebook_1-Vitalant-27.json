So instead of taking one phone call to fix it now takes at least 2 calls and having to wait anywhere from 1-4 hours for a desktop person to call back.  My machine died a couple of months ago and it took 3 days to get me a new one.  They won't even allow IT to come to us to set up our machines.  They deliver machines through inter-office courier, you are required to get all the cables plugged in correctly yourself, and then get to call AZ back to get another ticket written to the Dekstop team to call you about things that are wrong (like no printer set up, no Adobe, etc.).  All in all, I spent 3 working days wandering from free desk to free desk trying to find a place to work.  That was very cost effective.  New purchasing system now too time consuming.  If what you want is not in their storefront shops, it is on you to find what you want, find out the cost, hope the vendor is an approved vendor, then complete the purchase req and submit it.  That is all stuff our old purchasing agents used to do but -- oh yes -- they were all laid off.

I know this is in the past but is still the attitude the directors/management/recruitment all have. They will call you a few hours before you clock in while you are still in a slumber to tell you to come pick up the bus earlier then they had scheduled you.  Oh and if you say you can\u2019t get ready for a massive amount of attitude or a guilt trip of the century.  This companies standards are not based on how your work performance is, cuz you and everybody else and their moms will get an annual 2.5% raise.  Perfect for all your hard work right??  All the overtime you work on a consistent basis.  But those who don\u2019t perform to the expectations still walk away with the same exact raise as you, the hard working employee. If you\u2019ve never seen FMLA being used, this company has roughly 60-80% of the staff on it.  Some for other medical conditions but a lot for depression and anxiety and stress that the company places on their shoulders.  When the director decides to make a new work policy (use Facebook as a form of identification for the donors) the director will not own up to the falsely given information and put it onto our shoulders.  Favoritism is key here.  Kiss booty or don\u2019t expect to get anywhere.  And by anywhere there\u2019s only 2 positions you can rise up to.  Or 1 cuz the company only wants to promote from outside the company instead of within.  Promotions aren\u2019t about how hard you work for it.  It\u2019s about the person you hear telling jokes and laughing in managements office is who gets it.  Don\u2019t bother speaking at all or you might get under HR investigations.  Let\u2019s not forget.  ANYONE can get this job.  As long as you graduated high school.  If you fail training they will still pass you so it doesn\u2019t cost the company money and affect the turnover rate.  The company has been going downhill for years, and puts the blame on the mobile staff instead of looking in the mirror and seeing who the true culprit is.
