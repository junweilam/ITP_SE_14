The current morale is depleted, especially when combined with a lack of vision, transparency, and knowledge of current higher administration whom seem to know little about operating a college outside the realms of the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe Human Resources Department does not advocate or represent staff in an un-bias manner. The department abuses their power and, because they felt \"hurt\" by  someone, have demanded apologies and brought trivial matters to higher administration without being restorative or introspective. This department also wrongfully \"investigates\" and \"interrogates\" people who question their practice, autonomy, agenda, and honesty. The most disheartening part is the fact that this department wields  their \"Christian\" faith like an axe yet somehow miss the Gospel. \r\n\r\nPlease think and pray long and hard about working at this institution. I am not an employee who was terminated but rather left on my own terms. However, experiencing and witnessing what I have there has kept my therapist in business."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "It's hard to work at all when you have a hypercritical micromanager always looking over your shoulder", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Security Desk Worker in Bronxville, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Community..the work place was fun only because of the coworkers and never because of the administration", "cons": "In order to cut costs the administration chooses the least expensive or the best choice in plumbing, heat, electrical..and then when everything goes wrong it is the employees fault."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Failing institution interested in hobnobbing with Bronxville elite.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 May 2009", "job_title": " in Bronxville, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small college so you get to know everybody.", "cons": "Poor management practices; discrimination against anyone who is not Lutheran; buildings are falling apart."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great experience for students", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Peer Tutor in Bronxville, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Convenient, flexible, and interesting job.
