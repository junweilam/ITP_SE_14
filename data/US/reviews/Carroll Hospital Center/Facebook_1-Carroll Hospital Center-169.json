On the job learning is definitely required. There isn't much else in the way of healthcare systems training, and outside learning from vendor services is essentially non-existent, so learning hands-on is an absolute requirement. Management often does not relay team goals effectively to daily staff, which means initiatives are not fully understood. Work is often sent to outside contractors rather than hiring additional internal staff. This causes problems because new contractors usually do not understand the underlying systems in use, and often do not understand the politics of the environment. The heavy use of temporary contractors to handle workloads is an issue because contractors often do not have necessary underlying knowledge of the storage/technical and various independent medical systems which are not always interfaced or integrated. Employees are often placed in the position of training contractors who typically do not share their documentation of the work being done causing discrepancies in systems documentation.

I think that has gotten the management situation into trouble, but now that they have merged with lifebridge there has been a lot of adjustments to the leadership team. Understaffing is an issue, you get pulled often to other units leaving yours short and you seem to be treated unfairly on other units and get the worst assignment while there.  In addition, there is a lot of talking behind other people's backs, people act friendly to you and then talk about you poorly when your not there. Your nursing judgement and interventions or lack there of is always on the chopping block for evaluation by other nurses who think you should have done differently. My orientation as a brand new nurse years ago, was very challenging. I left many days in tears and wanted to quit because the senior nurses were so harsh with me and judge mental. The CEO is great-- but I think a negative is that she has 4 immediate family members working in various departments around the hospital and they are treated above the others by their direct supervisors and a direct source of information to their mother.
