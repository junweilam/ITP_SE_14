Her complete lack of communication with her own department as well as the rest of the hospital means that her decisions (and she makes all IT decisions) are made in a vacuum with no basis in real life experience.

This has resulted in extreme inefficiencies and risky patient safety policies.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the CEO is completely out of touch with his hospital.  On the one hand he puts out politically correct and glowing e-mails and blog posts about how wonderful the hospital is running.  In reality, his decisions to fire key long term and well respected personnel, completely suppress any opinion other than his own by threat of termination, and spend incredible amounts of hospital money on systems that were poorly chosen, again with no input from the people who will actually use them, have placed the hospital in a financially unstable state.  The hospital board seems oblivious that his actions place the hospital at risk.  There is a fear amongst upper and mid level managers and directors that any dissent or opinion that does not line up with the C-level thought will result in termination.  Subsequently, there is no discussion or evaluation prior to the institution of new policies.  And the fear is real.  Multiple high-level well thought of managers have been terminated without warning and for no apparent reason other than they expressed a dissenting opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this, the hospital is struggling.
