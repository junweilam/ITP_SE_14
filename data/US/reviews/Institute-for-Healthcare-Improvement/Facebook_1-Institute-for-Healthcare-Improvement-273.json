Assuming you don't take the stress of work with you when you leave the office...", "cons": "Recommend against applying to this organization, unless you really need a period of time with the aforementioned benefits. IHI prides itself on its cheeriness, positivity, and \"do goody\" mission. This is a veneer. In reality office culture is very stoic, antisocial, and the work is heavily profit driven.  Organization is very corporate for a nonprofit and leadership takes home large checks. The most fulfilling roles in the company are those with the a large degree of interface with external clients, since this offers an opportunity to benefit from IHI's well constructed image  and experience some connection to the mission. IHI's most successful work is driven greatly by part-time, contracted faculty. Ironically, it's successes with transformative change seem to stop at the door and most of the full-time staff lives for the status quo.\r\n\r\nCEO is good, upper level execs are not bad, but mid-management can be quite manipulative and frustrating. Management often promotes employees who are great at making it seem like their work is better than it actually is. Lots of instances of politically savvy employees of all levels coopting others' ideas as their own. Supervisory relationships are ambiguous and convoluted, so be prepared for that if you join. Also, I can guarantee you'll be in calls about meetings about meetings about jargon for 80% of your time.\r\n\r\nVery limited opportunities for advancement. Performance reviews are based entirely on subjective responses from anonymous surveys filled with open ended questions. Many who get promotions/raises fight for it harshly or after receiving external job offers. You will get promoted quickly if you visibly consume the corporate Kool Aid, or if you happen to get one of the few outstanding, supportive managers. Strong disparities in who gets promoted and how often.\r\n\r\nFinally, (some) staff of color have a consistently higher turnover due to the dominant upper-middle class, stern New England culture. Apparently they mentioned the issue in a recent blog, here's an excerpt: \"For example, in response to the statement, \u201cOverall, IHI is an excellent place to work,\u201d the numbers indicated a 30 percent difference between staff of color and white staff, with 98 percent of white staff agreeing or strongly agreeing compared to 68 percent of staff of color.\" Seems like an A+ vs. D+, but at least not an F.
