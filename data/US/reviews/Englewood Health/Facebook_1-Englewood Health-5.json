No clear relaying of expectations but certainly quick to blame the employees they supervise when that discrepancy becomes apparent. Management never takes responsibility for anything and blames everything on staff they supervise and create a fear environment by constant meetings which take up a lot of valuable time and constant reports to upper management (which is even further disconnected from the ground level of workers) - of course always skewing the facts to make themselves look good at the expense of their employees.  Timeliness is expected from you but managers don't hold themselves to the same standard - whenever you have a question it's always \"I'll get back to you on that\".  High turnover and can be a very stressful environment due to the workload they pile on one person especially given the generally lower salaries provided.  No sense of awareness or care from managers and providers regarding their staff's suggestions/issues - you feel like you are left unsupervised/no guidance and then blamed for everything that goes wrong by management that is for the most part absent.  High stress levels due to disconnect between management staff and providers - everybody wants is their way and you are the one who has to reconcile everyone's demand to come first and be a priority...maybe they assume their staff is an octopus with eight hands.  Very haphazard and disorganized training and lack of effective management of staff workload - no proper coverage arrangements, thus coming back to twice as much work when you are out sick or on vacation.  Management that fosters an environment of  fear and apprehension in their workplace, thus staff is scared to make a move. What should be most embarrassing for management is how they show up in a friendly manner and ask you what you need help with and what you think can be done to rectify issues that you have - and then steal your ideas and bring them to providers and their management without a single mention of where they got those ideas, which is quite frankly, pathetic just the same as stealing from a blind person is.
