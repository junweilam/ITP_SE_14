We were allowed to pick the times we came in for work if we had classes or something more important we needed to study for as students then we could skip an event and work another event instead. Outside the events time, we had office hours where we sat at the office to pick up calls if anyone needed AV help on campus and while there were no calls, we could do homework so it was a really flexible job where we still did important work without having to take too much time from our studies. My boss was really nice and would have us prioritize our health and whatnot, encouraging us to not miss meals for work and we all have good conversations about our lives. It's a relaxed job and I learned a lot about AV stuff that I ended up using for other parts of my life so I think it's an awesome job to have as a student.", "cons": "Pay's not good, it's minimum wage or just a bit higher, but that makes sense since it's a workstudy.
