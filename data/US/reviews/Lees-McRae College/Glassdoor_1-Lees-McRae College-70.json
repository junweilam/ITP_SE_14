He has never served in a faculty position, so he doesn't understand the challenges of a truly undergraduate faculty face day-to-day. He often makes knee-jerk reactions, with no sense of faculty input or governance, and is too focuses on creating the appearance of improvements to the college instead doing the hard work of improving faculty and staff morale and compensation, connection with the community, and providing professional development. \n\nMany of the faculty of the college at this college are either burnt out or unqualified, often times teaching below the standards and with lackluster energy, but because of the limited system of review and evaluation (there is no tenure system at this institution), they slide past for decades. Other times the administration just ignores issues of low pedagogy standards because the pay is so low, if someone is willing to show up to work, that is enough. \n\nIn the current president's time with the college, he has replaced five VPs (soon to be six, I've heard), often replacing them with friends. He not only allows individuals to hire their family in positions, but he himself has his wife serving as his secretary on a temporary basis, even though she has been there for over a year. \n\nI worked for this institution for nearly eight years and sadly can't recommend it to anyone, unless your desperate or using it as a stepping stone to a better position. With the lack of mentorship and faculty development, combined with low compensation and an unqualified administration, I would be surprised if this college keeps its accreditation and still is in operation in the next 10-15 years."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Adjunct salary", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Banner Elk, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice location, good food, friendly staff", "cons": "Salary, office conditions, benefits, career opportunities"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Professor in Banner Elk, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are very nice to work with", "cons": "Weather is harsh in the winter"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Low pay, lots of work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Banner Elk, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, relatively low pressure, nice area", "cons": "Poor pay, high work load, horrible administration"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Maybe when that president goes away.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Adjunct in Banner Elk, NC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Location is really the only advantage", "cons": "- Pretty much everything else.\r\n- The place is pretty much a textbook workplace nightmare, including staff spying for the president, constant infighting, terrible conditions, benefits, and pay, etc.\r\n- Most students are the lowest of the low, but some students are incredibly advanced and in honors programs.
