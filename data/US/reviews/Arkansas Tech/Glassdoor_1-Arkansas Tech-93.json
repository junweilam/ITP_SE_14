For reasons unknown to me, I became the target of a faculty mob.  My guess is that I unintentionally bruised someone\u2019s ego at some point.  I generally worked independently and kept a low profile.  My introverted and non-confrontational demeanor likely made me vulnerable to predators.  For a number of months, I faced passive aggressiveness and subtle bullying tactics by a group of four faculty members in my department.\r\n\r\nI learned the hard way that performance evaluations and performance improvement plans (PIPs) can arbitrarily be made and used to open the door through which to push any employee out of the workforce.  One month before my employment ended, I was broadsided with news that I had been dealt a scathing review of my job performance and had been placed on a period of probation.  In my case, for example, following three consecutive years of positive reviews, I learned suddenly that I was not taking lunch breaks at the right hour, that I was not adding enough posts to the department\u2019s Facebook page, and that I was not making full use of my student workers among other frivolous items.  None of these items had been addressed to me prior to the evaluation, nor was I ever advised that I should take lunch at a certain hour, to meet a specific quota of Facebook posts, or precisely what it meant to make full use of student office workers.  I usually took lunch breaks when I came to a satisfying stopping point between tasks or projects \u2013 I always went to lunch for an hour between 11am to 1pm \u2013 I did so for more than three years without receiving a complaint.\r\n\r\nOn a late afternoon during the last week of my employment, a group of faculty members, led by the department head, came into the main office where I worked and, without speaking one word to me, began disassembling my desk during the middle of a work project.  They reassembled the desk in a different section of the main office in front of a large window opening facing the hallway and directly in front of the elevator doorway.  I asked the department head why he was doing this and requested some distance away from the elevator doors.  In an effort to reason with him, I stated that I wouldn\u2019t mind being closer to the front of the office, but that being next to the elevator doors as well as the hallway foot traffic would likely be a distraction and may have a negative impact on my productivity.  He responded by pointing a finger at the desk, coldly saying, \u201cthe department needs you there.\u201d  Three days later, the department head, accompanied by an interim dean, walked into the main office while I worked.  He handed me a letter and asked me to read it then and there.  The letter notified me that he had deemed it improbable that I would successfully complete the demands of my performance improvement plan and stated that I must leave immediately as it was my last day with Arkansas Tech University.   The department head and the faculty mob had framed me as a difficult employee for questioning the relocation of my workspace.  Furthermore, Human Resources provided no help or guidance to me throughout these troubling events even when I mentioned a problem to them.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty and humiliation of those experiences were tremendous.  I\u2019ve never been in a work environment so toxic and abusive.  It has severely damaged my attitude and support for academia.   What\u2019s worse is that I am an alumnus of that university.  I earned both my bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees there.  I feel utterly mutilated and let down."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great starter position with room for upward movement", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Network Support Analyst in Russellville, AR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you were willing to assert yourself, there was room for promotion.
