You are allowed a small amount of empathy as long as you can finish the call and wrap it up within 6 minutes. because you are working with clients that need childcare assistance, so a lot of these parents are dealing with really tough situations. and it can be hard to put you metrics over helping them. In this job you have to remember that you are A call center rep not a case manager or an investigator so whatever problems you face on the phone with the caller, you cannot take on their problems, for the sake of your metrics ( performance measurement) and job performance.

They will say and do whatever to make people donate to them.  Low admin cost is a joke,  they receive both public and government funding (for 211 and different grants). Just say they get $1m from each,  total fund raised $2m. Their admin & fundraising cost is $.4m.  They are deemed efficient at 20% cost, but it is indeed 40% if you don't count public funding,  which means,  $4 out of $10 you donate goes to fund UW,  then the remaining $6 get distributed to community partners who also have admin cost.

He prefers to engage with problems in theoretical fashion, rather than by realistically assessing the human (and other) resources available to him and going from there. As a result, staff are asked to get behind one grandiose plan after another - but none of them ever quite work out because the guy loses interest and moves on to something new.  A further symptom of this malaise is the management structure, which is byzantine in its complexity: new titles for departments (and department heads), juggling of staff from one management silo to another, failure to define people's responsibilities (or even the jargon used in job descriptions) - no wonder people outside the organization tend to say \"chaos\" when asked their opinion of the organization.  Finally, there is the sense that UWSEM (like many other United Ways across the country) has outlived its usefulness in some ways. The days when corporations saw an advantage in working with United Way on a corporate in-house campaign are, if not over, surely numbered.
