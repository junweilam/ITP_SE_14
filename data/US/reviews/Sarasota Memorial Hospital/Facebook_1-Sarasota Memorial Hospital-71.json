I worked for am employer in 1996 who allowed $2500 per year, so SMH doesn't provide a competitive amount of tuition reimbursement benefits reflecting 2021 dollars, and it's structured to where students can't access all of it. Also, it wasn't until this month that the hospital recognized certification in specialty areas with monetary compensation. Nurses now receive $1.50/hour extra for certification.
