I snicker as I read a review written by a current employee raving about the low turnover rate, putting God first and the positive, life changing impact the school has on students.  I remember being regaled with the same tellings during an employment interview at Community Care College and later found absolutely no validity whatsoever in these canned talking points.\r\n\r\nI had the misfortune of being seated within earshot of a department that sued dropouts.  Listening as former students would literally beg, cry and plead that a lawsuit garnishing their already meager wages for the inability to make payments be  dropped.  I was horrified by some of the ghastly responses such as \"it's not my problem\" and \"you should have thought about this before you enrolled\", or \"well, that's just too bad.\"  Locks were placed on certain departments doors shortly after this practice began.  Hearing these sorts of conversations  marked the lowest point of my employment time at CCC and necessitated the employment of some heavy duty mental gymnastics before reporting to work each day.\r\n\r\nIn the open air, management required that the financial aid department not \"package\" new enrollees who brought with them large amounts of existing student loan debt along with a history of multiple drops from other schools nobly suggesting that an almost inevitable repeat would only deepen the existing hole of a potential student.  I can't  count the number of those that fit this very scenario who were enrolled and saddled with even more loan debt only to drop  a short time later.  Looking back, I feel shame that I played a role in robbing others of any hope of financial freedom, the very thing that brought them to the doors of CCC. \r\n\r\nThere were bloodbaths of layoffs and firings.  I recall the insult and anguish of a good number close friends as they were forced to fight for unemployment benefits after it was said that their dismissal was due to spending too much time on the internet, which, in every case was later disproven.  \r\n\r\nThe glowing reviews on this site are unsurprising, as I recall that on at least two occasions I (as well as many others) was required to publicly express positive statements about the school.  One in the form of a written statement regarding what a great company CCC was to work for and the other a video recording of what a great benefit the school was to it's students.  I reluctantly did as I was told, but didn't dare tout the \"God first\" tenant, as by doing so  marking myself a charlatan. \r\n\r\nJob placement  is a joke.  Graduates were regularly placed in jobs that had very little connection to their respective field of study.  \r\n\r\nThis new talk of being non-profit is a smoke screen.  There are 101 ways to be classified as such and still direct dollars dirctly into the pockets of owners and shareholders.  \r\n\r\nWhile my salary was decent, I would never  work for this company again.  It made me feel dirty and shameful.
