My supervisor who was a younger white woman did not like me because I had a higher education level than her. She started harassing me on my second week on the job with mild sarcasm. This supervisor only trained me one time during the month I was employed on the campus. However, the other staff member trained me well and I learned all the systems in three weeks time period. The supervisor was very intimidated about me because I learned everything so quickly.  She was determined to get rid of me, so this supervisor went to her manager to lie that I was not doing things correctly. One thing she did not realized is that I would double-check with the staff member who trained me to confirm I was doing everything correctly.  The supervisor waited until I worked all day and as I was walking to my car had the hiring office to call me stating that I was removed from my employment.  The manager who I only saw about three times the entire time I was working there told my hiring office I was punctual meaning on time to work everyday, friendly with staff and students, and had great work ethics. So, I found out from a staff member that this supervisor always remove African American employees from working in that office because she does not want African Americans working in the front office. This is clearly discrimination and racism. I expressed my concerns to the hiring office but nothing was done about this situation. I will be taking this up to a meeting with state officials that can do something about the problems American Americans and minorities are dealing with at USC and other places of employment in the State of South Carolina.
