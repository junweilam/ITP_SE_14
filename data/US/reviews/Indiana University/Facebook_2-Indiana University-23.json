They send out plenty of propaganda trying to convince you they care, but their actions speak much louder than their words. They forced everyone to go back to campus after we all worked remotely for over a year, and there was little flexibility with allowing continuation of remote work. The new president was hand-picked by one trustee (no longer there) and was chosen in a very concerning manner (decision made behind closed doors, threw out initial search party's choices, etc...there is an article written by an IU instructor that explains this in-depth). There are meetings happening with this new president where she puts everyone's cell phones into a black bag and forbids the presence of pen and paper. IU is currently laying off staff members across all campuses for the sake of their budgets while spending money on new statues, buildings, unnecessary events, and upper-management. One example of this was the unveiling of a $60,000 jaguar statue on the IUPUI campus earlier in 2021 for \"campus beautification\", which was actually ready much sooner but kept hidden during 2020 because they didn't want to look bad putting up a statue worth nearly twice my salary in the middle of a pandemic. IU constantly pushes advisors to do more for student retention while refusing to let them work remotely, criminally underpaying them, and laying them off because the \"data\" said they were no longer useful. Oh, and did I mention that IU consistently brags about IU being the safest place to be during Covid while cases around the world skyrocket and IU no longer offers asymptomatic testing or boosters? \n\nThere are so many other things I could discuss here, but the bottom line is this: don't work for IU.
