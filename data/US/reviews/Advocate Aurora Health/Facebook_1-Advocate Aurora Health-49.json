I got terminated after my entire shift stating that I was not a good fit the team, and that management had to do what was best for the team. The irony is that they do not even know who is on their team. Unless, you were just like them to get ahead. My Customer service was top tier and not even one complaint. What was the real reason?

Eventually lockdown restrictions eased and I was able to get back to a normal schedule.\r\n\r\nI was able to eventually leverage my experience and networking as a contractor into a full time, permanent position in AAH in a Field Services Technician role for one of their biggest hospitals as a professional level TSA. My direct leadership is focused but fair, the team I work with are all competent workers and the work itself is very fast paced.\r\n\r\nI consider myself fortunate to have landed a role where I am able to make significant contributions with my experience, education and skill set, while still having a wealth of things that I still need to learn.", "cons": "For my role specifically, there was very little in the way of salary negotiation. Because this organization is \"not for profit\" they of course do their best to remain competitive in the job market for equivalent roles, but essentially \"their offer was their offer\" in terms of salary, with no bargaining for something higher. If I were entertaining a separate offer, I would have to take the higher salary even though this position may be more closely aligned with my skill set and career goals.\r\n\r\nBecause of the COVID pandemic, sweeping generalizations were made regarding which functional groups could work from home and which were essential in office, clinic, hospital jobs. \r\n\r\nThere are of course types of work that can only be done in person, but there are other groups, like mine, which I would consider \"gray areas\" where much work can be done from home with little lack of efficiency or productivity, but even spending one of the five work days a week from home can be frowned upon and only seems to be allowed under special circumstances. It seems unfair given the ability of a good portion of the workforce that already WFH efficiently, to not be able to accomplish at least part of our workload from home. \r\n\r\nTo be fair, too much of one thing or another can be monotonous, if I spent every day from months on end either WFH or at office exclusively for weeks or months on end, the possibility exists that I may get bored of it. A little of both certainly can't hurt worker morale or their ability to do their work. It may actually even help.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with my former position in a \"for profit\" LLC, salary employees are able to log and \"bank\" overtime hours, with the option to either collect straight time pay or use those banked hours as PTO. This allowed salaried workers of that company to be able to put in necessary hours during project \"crunch\" time but be compensated in extra pay or extra time off later on. \r\n\r\nEarly on I simply lost track of all the times I have stayed late tying up loose ends and not leaving work for the next day. I typically spend 30 minutes to a couple of hours at the end of my shift each day wrapping up my work, and catching up on ancillary items like email follow ups, mandatory training, knowledge enhancing and logging details of my work so I don't have to proverbially \"reinvent the wheel\" if I encounter a similar problem solving issue in the future. \r\n\r\nNowadays, it's a little bit better, because we are now proactively logging in our time spent doing various tasks per day including, time spent training, in meetings, any overtime and time spend resolving \"emergency\" technical issues. There of course is no compensation for the overtime logged, but at least management as a record of the effort we may put fourth, especially when we are inundated with technical, incidents, requests and project work. But I can only hope the data and knowledge is used judiciously and those that actually put in the extra effort are somehow recognized."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "They treat you like poo", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Nurse Technician in Park Ridge, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not much very boring and demanding work with the face of the company a clueless wit", "cons": "They take advantage of you pay you dirty and over load you with patients"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place team work efforts", "cons": "Not the place I see myself with a life"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Anesthesia department is not well supported by management.

If they call you back and you do not answer because it is after hours or you are with a patient they close the ticket and you need to start over. They do not provide information or an opportunity to call them back. If they do get in contact with you they often do not know how to fix the issue and you are left with work arounds that increase time or difficulty when completing work tasks.

and thorough preceptors\r\n-Involvement with patient interventions/recovery\r\n-Great teamwork within the department\r\n-Staff has patience with new employees learning the job responsibilities and duties\r\n-Accommodating to work schedules, appointments and other obligations arranged prior to employment at Aurora\r\n-Accommodating to any difficulties an employee may experience\r\n-When needed other staff members will assist in the department where they can (ex: housekeeping coming down and cleaning rooms which were not isolation rooms, house supervisor assisting with patient and ED needs, ect)\r\n-Orientation \"leader/supervisor\" always keeping in touch and asking about any needs or questions", "cons": "-Many job expectations were not explained to me in which lead me to have to reach out for answers and explanations\r\n-Unable to learn/preform tasks hands-on many times due to high work volume in department and more efficient for staff to quickly perform the task themselves\r\n-Too much to do in a small window of time throughout orientation\r\n-I had to learn/teach myself how to navigate through Epic due to not being able to attend an Epic class (not being held because of Covid) and high work volumes leaving department staff unable to train me\r\n-At times the work load is not distributed evenly amongst employees of the same licensure within the department (ex: 1 ED RN has 5 patients while the 2nd ED RN has 1)\r\n-Busy shifts make it impossible to have a break\r\n-Communication amongst ED staff on duty throughout the shift could improve (it isn't bad but it could improve)"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities":
