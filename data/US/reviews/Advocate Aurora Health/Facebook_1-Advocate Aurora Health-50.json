Then they hired a supervisor and racially profiled me from the minute she started working there. More than half of the clinic employees quit due to the unskilled ethic of management. I was 1 of 2 Hispanics working here in the South Holland location. My work spoke for his self when doctors where defending me and loved to work with me. I never understood why this supervisor never liked me other than me being Hispanic. I have came to her and talked to her professionally to help me understand why and she always gave me a bs excuse. Also they threw New commitments on me with not proper training and basically blamed me for everything even though I came to them with proper time to resolve everything.
