Job specific pros: set work schedule with very little overtime, great co-workers, wonderful patients, and interesting and challenging work. Great benefits: health insurance - UT pays for employee benefits and adding family members is reasonable. Retirement - participates in TRS with employer match and good long-term security. Retirees can keep their health insurance after working at UTSW for a minimum of 10 years. PTO - tiered earnings with longevity beginning at 8hr/month both sick and vacation, plus \"flexible holiday\" hours and Texas/Federal holidays are days off.

The \"7-minute rule\" applies - being later than 7 minutes after your assigned start time is a huge negative. This job is great for someone who likes routine and predictability. However, because you're part of a team and everyone has a significant workload, it's tough to get time away and any deviation from your set schedule requires planning. This is not a job for someone who needs/likes flexibility! Stressful workload: there is always more work than can be reasonably accomplished in 40 hours a week. UT saves on staff costs, so plan to work hard. Low salary: to make up for great benefits, salaries are below industry standards, sometime well below. However, since it's a public entity, you can find salary information online, and can (and should) ask the salary range. Raises are maximum 3-5% per year, with 5% being incredibly exceptional. Plan 3% increase per year with excellent job performance, so your starting salary is crucial. No bonuses. High turnover: because of the low salary and minimal increases, co-workers leave for better opportunities instead of growing within their current job. 100% turnover of non-supervisor positions is normal. Low \"fun factor\": time away for team building, training, or anything outside of normal job duties is considered a problem.

As soon as my production took a hit from me struggling and not being able to speak to anyone in regards to my issues because the management made sure to take one thing I said and turned it into a fireable offense instead of helping me and proving me with the support I needed. So make sure you keep up with your FMLA and document EVERYTHING. If your management has any video confrences with you, make sure they are recorded. As management will lie if they do not have anything other than your word against theirs. When it is a team of 2 supervisors and the manager who ends up getting promoted to department director they will all stick up for each other, which i can't blame them, the director of the department leads with fear, no mercy, no grace. All their good workers leave and they get repplaced with problematic people who just suck up and rub the director's ego to stay on their \"good side.\" It's ALL politics at UT Southwestern it's not WHAT you know it's WHO you know and WHO's friend you pretend to be.

Little response to concerns from management. No open door policy with director. Confusing department goals, no clear goals establish and when asked, goals were kept private and secret. Trainer allowed to continue to work from home, even during high demands ie: 5 new employees starting at the same time during one month and again last on, 4 new employees starting at the same time, with no lesson plan, onboarding curriculum, expectations not communicated to new hire or trainer. No work life balance. All HIM employees allowed to work-from-home full time or on variable schedule, except CDI employees. Unclear reasoning provided to explain this practice. Would have been useful especially during construction constraints on parking and physical availability within hospital building. Majority of physician communication is done via email or phone not in person, which was favored by the physicians."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Ratings", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a Great place to work", "cons": "Wish they paid a lot more"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Job stability", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "18 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great health benefits and decent pay", "cons": "No room for advancement opportunities"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Feb 2021", "job_title": "AP Manager in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work.

For teaching, we have incredible clinical sites--Parkland hospital, Children's Medical Center---you can't beat that! If your program/office is on the main or north campus, the facilities are new, clean, and with all sorts of resources such as places to eat, relax, or shop while not in your office/work space.

Our employee evaluation system has been subjective at best, and \"friends\" of the department head receive the larger raises and desirable assignments, regardless of qualifications and ability. Raises have been almost non-existent, even for promotions. \"Free\" days off or \"working from home\" days are rewarded unevenly and generally only to the friends of the department head. If you want to perform formal research, you will pay your own expenses (statistician, editor etc.) in our department. Research is not promoted in our department and is not rewarded by administrative support, salary or perks. I agree with the other reviewers who said that HR and even the deans turn a deaf ear to pleas for fair practices--in fact, have seen a couple of employees eventually lose their jobs by going to them. For a university, I have been very surprised at the conservatism, fear of progress, and lack of forward thinking in my department.

A very youthful environment where many folks are either starting Medical School, working on their Residency or Fellowships, and many Nurses and Doctors around the campus. Many Departments to transfer to over time, centrally located near Love Field Airport.", "cons": "Biggest complaint is that you are totally dependent on your Supervisor to determine your fate as to whether you stay after 6 months or are terminated within 3-4 months. If your Supervisor decides he/she does not like you for any reason, it becomes a standard routine to write you up for every petty issue or mistake, with termination highly certain. The politics at UTSW is very ugly and worse than the corporate world. During my probationary period I was treated as if I was a Contractor more than an Employee. The group I was in was the Pediatrics Dept, and take my advice and avoid this department at every angle! This is the only group that is highly dysfunctional in terms of how management treats their staff, and all of the managers are tightly connected to the HR department, so if you ever have a grievance or valid complaint while on probation you can expect no support from HR and it will actually make things worse as it did for me. Promotions are based on years of experience rather than actual skills and accomplishments. Very minimal pay raises provided if any at all. The Admin from my department had not received a pay raise in 8 years! The Pediatrics department has had 12 terminations in the last 12 months, so if you don\u2019t fit the mold you\u2019ll be quickly gone with NO recourse. When terminated as a Probationary Employee you cannot appeal the decision. On my way out I was told HR would include a 3rd-party independent person in the review of my case and response document in my defense, but that was totally false and they never bothered to consider my written response so I was terminated before the 90-day point. Despite many accomplishments and successes on the job, my Supervisor nit-picked everything regularly and I was written up for taking a Sick Day when I needed one. Their Job Descriptions are way too vague, and  allows too large a window for \u201cOther Projects as Assigned\u201d. In my case I was terminated for making common mistakes any new employee will make that were based on tasks not specified anywhere in my Job Description while learning the job the hard way, without any documentation and with a Supervisor that would only meet with me one hour per week. When I was terminated my Supervisor was promoted to a higher level despite her poor communication skills both verbally and in writing. When I asked for details in writing about projects I was working on my Supervisor always replied that if she had to put things in writing she might as well do everything herself. Finally, this place is really just an Adult Day Care Center, and good people are regularly micro-managed by boneheads who intimidate and criticize rather than facilitate your adjustment during probation or help you be successful on the job. The good people get smart and quickly transfer to another department after their 6-month stint. People were assigned to tasks outside of the scope of their jobs, such as being assigned as the temporary Manager of a group until someone qualified is actually hired in the position. IT folks are abused daily by over-demanding and uneducated users, and are not given the resources they need to do their jobs properly (most work out of a closet). If you can work within a box and like being criticized for tasks you are assigned to outside of your job scope, this is for you."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Fantastic place to do your PhD", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Apr 2014", "job_title": "Graduate Student in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Committed, innovative, friendly scientists.
