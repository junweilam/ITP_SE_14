The facility for the most part is nice to work in when things aren't breaking or falling apart. Certain management actually work hard and fight for their nurses.", "cons": "NOT ENOUGH STAFF!! Possibly it's because we get paid less than any area hospital as full time staff. The only real way to make a living working less than 50+hours a week is to be a part of the recourse team because they make literally double if not two and a half times as much as a new hire full time employee. If the hospital would restrict how many resource nurses they were being allowed to hire then maybe the floors would be staffed with their own employees. The grass is not always green on the other side though. When a manager sees that a resource nurse is coming to the floor they will specifically give them a harder set of patients because \"they get paid more to take he heavier patient loads\". The clinical lader system is a joke... basically the only way to get a decent raise is to perform tasks for the hospital such as evidence based practice projects and earn a BSN instead of being based on performance or patient satisfaction. Most managers have no desire to help. They have little to no desire to actually help with patient care sometimes refusing to take a patient in order to keep a staff nurse from taking an unsafe patient load. Let's just say I've seen more nurses filing safe harbor in the last months than I ever would have imagined at such a large facility. This hospital has gone to hell in a hand basket in the last 2 years and everything they are trying to do to make it more cutting edge and \"efficient\" is making it harder and harder to actually work and care for patients which is the main reason most of us became nurses! As far as patient care goes... get ready to be treating a computer rather than your patients because the EHR system is difficult to navigate and is very redundant. I spend more time charting on my patients than I do actually caring for them... last and not least... it's saying something when you have most of the clinical managers on every floor stepping down or quitting even directors leaving and then their positions not being refilled... managers are jumping ship before  they go down with the boat. And a lot of employees are following suit..."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "MMH/MH.
