Almost to a person was told this was the place to work at. They focused on the servant leadership of the current manager Mike and the openness of each and everyone of the management team from Mike up to the CEO. From there I decided that I wanted to work there. Mike has certainly lived up to the Servant leader reputation, he is fair and honest and open. He exudes the open door policy but when something goes wrong and discipline is needed he is fair in his meting the discipline out. The hospital lives the \"Just Culture\" mantra and compared to my previous work, this is a breath of fresh air. The Hospital has in my opinion overcome it's history of having a bad reputation and care has become very very good. The hospital earned a incredible prestigious honor and was named a five-star rating for overall quality from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the most recent release of its Overall Hospital Quality Star Ratings in July 2022. I consider our Ambulance service to be one of the Top ambulance services in the state, we were featured in the MEMSA monthly magazine for the October issue and our ambulance service picture is featured on www.memsa.org main page The hospital is forward thinking due to a incredible leadership \"C-suite\" team and to prove this point, the hospital has identified a missing component in the mid missouri area for cancer patients. We are building a Radiation Oncology center on campus that will allow cancer patients who would normally have to drive up to 100 miles one way to get their radiation treatment (which usually lasts 10-20 minutes) and then drive home. Having a radiation oncology option closer to home for these patients is a game changer and could be the difference in having those patients say no to that type of treatment due to the drive. One of the other neat things about GVMH is Craig our CEO gives out at new employee orientation his personal cell phone number to all new employees and urges them to use that number if they ever need to talk to him. Talk about an open door policy. We are a level III stroke center, meaning we can treat strokes with medication up to 4.5 hours from start of symptoms. I could go on and on but these are just some of the reasons why I have returned to work at this organization for a third time since 1990.", "cons": "Some of my cons are: 1. The hospital sends a lot of patients to other facilities. This ends up with a lot of transfers for the ambulance service. Of course many of these cannot be avoided but some seem to be able to be taken care of in house in my opinion but I am not a physician so I cannot make that determination. 2. There are still some services that this hospital does not have on a 24 hour basis but I know that the administration is actively recruiting for providers to fill those voids. 3. My manager although he is open and communicates openly even he admits that he has a problem with communication and is working on it. I have not seen any issues with communication but it's nice to see that a manager is willing to admit to shortcomings especially when my previous job didn't have this openness. 4. The FTO process could have been more focused. Feedback was given but not as detailed as it could have been. Places I've been to before have had a much more robust FTO process than here. This is an easy fix and easily implemented."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Golden Valley", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Lab Technician in Clinton, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pro would be that you get promised hours.", "cons": "Con would be that sometimes you get overworked."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Place to work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Licensed Practical Nurse Med Surg Unit Nurse in Clinton, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The management team is fantastic, there is self scheduling and if you need to they work with you to change shifts, they give you the resources you need to give excellent care to our patients.
