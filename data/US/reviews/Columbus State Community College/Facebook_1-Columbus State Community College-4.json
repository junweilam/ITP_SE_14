You can hold the same position as someone on campus, but they could make $20,000 more per year and you end up having to fix all of the work that they send you because they refuse to learn from past mistakes. Let's say you put together a competent raise proposal to try and get equal pay -- it'll be swept under the rug and since most directors don't talk with your average employee, you'll never really get a chance to find out why or what happened. Most accomplishments/achievements are completely ignored. You could save the college thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars a year by making a simple change that only affects 2-3 people, but you'll receive no more than a thank you email. You can do this multiple times, bringing your savings into the hundreds of thousands, but you'll still just get a thank you email or a \"Cougar Paw.\" Meanwhile, someone created a cool little sticker to give out to students and they'll end up with employee of the month. Most departments treat their budget like it's Monopoly money. I kid you not the first few months I was with the college someone referred to it as this phrase. At the end of every fiscal year there is a spending spree throughout the college because, and I quote people who have been with the college for 2-3 decades, \"If you don't spend it, you don't get it next time.\" They continue this cycle every year, stock piling items that end up being thrown out or replaced the following year despite the items being perfectly fine, but you know, they gotta spend that money or they don't get it back.
