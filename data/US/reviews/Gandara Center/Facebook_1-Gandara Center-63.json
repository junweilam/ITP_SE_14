Neither for payment, professional trainings nor growth opportunities. If you plan on accepting a job with Gandara be very observant of what they omit in your offer. Chances are they won't include medical leave in your offer, nor tell you that the bonuses are tax-deductible and will pretty much drop by half of what they're offering you by the time they're paid. If you get sick, the time you're away comes out of your PTO or vacation time, they won't tell you this at the start. \r\n\r\nIf you come from Spain or DR to work in Gandara, you should know that they will probably under pay you compared to other Colleagues, and they probably will take advantage of your economic needs and tie you up with an absurdly long contract that will ensure them your stay for an extended period of time, even after you get your visa. Be wary of the H-2 visas, the work environment is not the best one to suffer exile away from your family. You will probably get fewer benefits and payment compared to an employee with an American Passport. Honestly for what all this employer will put you trough, is better to try and make it work in your own country close to the people you love, or definitely look for another Company who will host your work visa. Gandara will most certainly exploit you and benefit from you the best it can, they don't care at all if you progress, if you get your permanent residency or if they have to return you back because you don't agree with their practices. \r\n\r\nThe work environment is as toxic as it could be, gossips are the order of the day, and this does not exclude the higher-ups. Additionally, they have a reactive mindset, not a proactive one. They probably won't act up on your concerns or ideas as an employee. They will only act up on something if they find they're liable in some way or if the Regional Director, CEO or CCO demands it. They won't help you to get any supervision hours, certifications or any other form of professional growth you might want to pursue. They only care about you meeting their productivity demands and interests.\r\n\r\nThey will request from you an absurd number of productivity units, to the point that you will have no personal life, you will have no rest, and you will be having to sacrifice personal time to meet their expectations. THIS IS NOT AN 8HR JOB, even if the contract says so. If you meet the weekly units, you probably have to do extra productivity considering you also have to put in excessive documentation and meet the deadlines. You will have to do this documentation pretty much on your own, considering that there are only 2 people working per Client. You will also have to accommodate any mandatory trainings and workshops to their productivity demands, as they will not change at all, you will have to put in the weekly 108 units without any exceptions. YOUR MENTAL HEALTH WILL DETERIORATE, and they won't help you or do anything at all to avoid this from happening. \r\n\r\nDo not trust in the toxic dynamic of \"One big happy family\" no one in Gandara will think it twice to turn their back on you, if it means saving their own skin. Absolutely no one is your friend, and if they are, you will get accused of overstepping your boundaries by your higher-ups. If they don't agree with you in any way, shape or form, they will do anything in their power to make you feel uncomfortable and move on. \r\n\r\nBeware of discrimination and retaliation, it will happen either by race, gender, sexuality or mental health. They clearly don't practice what they preach. The personnel is, ironically, highly uneducated to deal with diversity issues or practices. \r\n\r\nRaises are yearly, only if you make their absurd tiers and will only be an increment of less than $0.25/hr. On top of that, always double-check your incomes and confirm that the company is paying you what it was agreed in your contract. Assume that you can't even trust them to pay you the agreed amount you signed in for.\r\n\r\nIf by the end of this you decide to try your luck and sign-in with this company, talk with any of your co-workers and confirm for yourself that all of this is a fact."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Pay", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Client Services Manager in Springfield, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can get good experience if wanting to become a social worker", "cons": "Barley help with upper management\r\nHaving to deal with being on call"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great company to work for!
