There were 2 nurses (overnight shift) doing heroin while on the unit and one nurse overdosed.

I've unfortunately witnessed patients who were denied medical care, one woman (frequent flyer) actually had a malignant tumor in her stomach and definitely was not \"over exaggerating\" her pain. The head doctor/psychiatrist almost killed a patient because he lost (multiple times) in court to have her placed on mandatory medication, so the one time she acted up, he called for the level 3 shots. Her blood pressure dropped so low that she was barely conscious for 2 & 1/2 days. When the supervisors get the heads up that OMH is coming to check in, they have all staff cleaning and checking the charts to make sure there's no errors, etc. Prior to me starting, 3 people had successfully committed suicide and 1 died due to overmedicated by head psychiatrist.
