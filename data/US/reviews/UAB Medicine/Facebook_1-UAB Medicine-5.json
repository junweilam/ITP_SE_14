Most are in a bad mood and it is your job to make sure they are as comfortable as possible. Every patient that came to my desk was met with a smile and 100% customer service. However, my manager was not interested in the success stories. The only time she interacted with me was to reprimand me on a situation I usually had little control over. For example, I once had a patient come up to me to ask a question. If you have worked in a clinic setting this happens a lot and mostly when you are with another patient or completing a different task. This patient in particular already had hostile body language.  I kindly told her I was on the phone, looking back I would have clarified that I was with a patient. The patient then went to complain about the rude girl who was taking a personal call and refused to help her. My manager overheard and marched (powered walked) to me and began to accuse me of being rude to a patient. This was the third instance in which her passion for reprimand overthrew her ability to understand a situation.  She was passionate about me not doing my job correctly and being rude to customers and I quote \"You need to be nicer to patients\". Usually, I am always open to criticism but her reaction was so unfounded I almost cried on the spot from frustration.  More often than not I had rude patients that I had to smile at and pretend not to notice their horrible behavior. My fellow coworkers would compliment me on how much I cared and listened to our patients and to have my manager tell me I needed to be nicer made me realize that she never noticed my work. She didn't see how hard I tried and how many people I made smile. That was when I knew I was done.
