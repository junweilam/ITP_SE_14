For the most part, everyone gets along and tries to help eachother out.  I was a new grad when I started working at Hanover Healthcare and Rehab Center, and I found that not only occupational therapists, but also the phyiscal therapists were willing to help me learn and have continued to be helpful as I've grown as a therapist.  Everyone there helps eachother out.  Our facility is about to grow, but we are very organized and have a way of working that helps make the day flow even with an increased case load.  It's a faced paced, demanding job that rarely feels boring.  I genually love working here!", "cons": "As of right now, because of a high demand for therapists, but a small pool to choose from, there's a high case load, and a stress on productivity time.

My manager was a woman so completely self absorbed that she never missed a photo op or chance to brand an employee's good idea as her own. She promoted perceived loyalty to her over ability, education, and experience every time. Very insecure and controlling, though this was not confined to our department exclusively. Several other managers were also very \"difficult.\"  Some were ok. The CNO is out of touch with reality. She has brought on some of her cronies from MD hospitals where she has worked in the past who are equally poor leaders. The wages are poor. There was no weekend differential and shift differentials were poor. Nurses are floated from unit to unit with little consideration for skill or patient acuity. It can be dangerous at times due to the staffing mix. They prefer young staff who make less money and who will be less likely to challenge authority. Those with opinions or backbones need not apply. They insist wages are \"market\" competitive. I think they are comparing their wages with Myers Meat Market, maybe?"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Pharmacy Technician Certified", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "25 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Certified Pharmacy Technician in Hanover, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Clean working environment.
