It was my experience to be demeaned, yelled at, cursed at, without reproach, by physicians and those in authority positions. I witnessed upper management subtly and not-so subtly threaten coworkers with un-safe and unfair patient assignments. Breaks are few and far between, and your job responsibilities will soon expand to cater to anyone above you. Upper management cares very little for employees, and while your unit manager may be approachable and friendly, they have very little power or control over the policies that become their duty to enforce. It was my experience that new policies and procedures would be added to the daily workload, despite staff's concern of how to safely and effectively carry out these new responsibilities. Patient safety will be touted as an important part of the \"We CARE\" philosophy; however, the truth is the slogan should read, \"We CARE...about your money.\" Patient safety is only an issue after something happens, and the truth is if it does, you will be held accountable - not the practices that set it up to occur (i.e. understaffing, unsafe patient ratios, increasing workload demands without reasonable ways to execute). Budget cuts will force you to take on more responsibilities in patient care, despite an increasing lack of manpower to carry out your duties. No further compensation was added, despite the increased workload, and the company remains in a constant state of failure to retain employees. \r\n\r\nRetention is not important to FGH as they are constantly resupplied by a never ending stream of new graduates from the surrounding areas. This allows them to avoid raises in compensation. It was not uncommon for when a new raise occurred, it to be brought about by senior employees (5+ yrs experience) complaining that the new graduate RN was hired on at near their base compensation. Budget cuts removed insurance for part-time employees and full-time employee spouses. \r\n\r\nTo illustrate the lack of empathy this organization has for its employees, listen to these anecdotes: 1. For nurses week, the entire hospital was provided a pancake/waffle breakfast. These pancakes were under national recall for being infected with listeria. My manager was made personally aware of the national recall; however, these waffles were still served. The followed week was inundated with announcements encouraging employees to seek a free ER referral if they displayed symptoms. 2. A manager, when asked about hazard pay during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, responded, \"If you want hazard pay, go bag groceries at Wal-Mart.\" The resounding theme of FGH is that it remains a vestige of the old south. It is a \"good ole boys\" club of which you will never be a part. If your licensure is below that of Dr, if you fall within ancillary staff or even RN, or if you are not within the upper echelons of employment, you do not matter to this corporation.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend working here any extended period of time beyond 1 year."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Salary", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Acute Care Technician in Hattiesburg, MS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great staff and great facility", "cons": "You must work 12 hour shifts"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2022", "job_title": "Paser in Hattiesburg, MS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits and great coworkers", "cons": "Mediocre pay, not enough consideration."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Poor", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Patient Transporter in Hattiesburg, MS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Patient interaction, co-workers, Location, variety", "cons": "pay, schedule, management, workload, expectations"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Absolutely the best people to work with", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Analyst in Hattiesburg, MS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility with hours, work from home", "cons": "Currently stagnation in promotions and pay increases.

If the tech doesn't want to help you with a patient you must do it yourself or get another nurse to help. If respiratory doesn't come when called, it's your fault. Staff meetings are used to tell you how bad your performance is. Very little praise. No thank yous. Former patients mention they sent a letter about how well they were treated but you never see the letter. You don't know if it made it to your personnel file or not. Managers have little power over units and must spend the majority of their time in meetings, precious little time with their staff. They are way understaffed. Most of the surgical, medical, cardiology, etc. units will assign 8-9 patients to a nurse. This is dangerous but if you complain you will have out your job in Jeopardy. If a complaint is made against you, the management may or may not listen to your side. If they dismiss your argument, you have no appeal. Overtime is not allowed regardless of patient condition.
