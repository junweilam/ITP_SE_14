Antivax, antimask attitudes were rampant among support staff and leadership. When I brought up concerns about this, they went nowhere, ultimately because almost everyone all the way up (in my clinic) shared the same political opinions. One of our management staff got covid, and the day she returned from her sick leave, she was still not wearing a mask when speaking to staff. When I reported my concerns about a comment my director had made, she pulled me into her office and accused me of lying and slander.\n\nHuman Resources is a joke, by the way--I sent them screenshots of my manager directly violating written MultiCare policies about work hours, and they essentially told me it was an interpersonal issue. Any issue I sent them was quickly closed without any serious attempt to resolve it. They don't stand by their own policies. I genuinely have no idea what they do all day. Compliance is also a joke. MultiCare was temporarily out of compliance because they didn't keep up on state mandates regarding masking/vaccination attestation in workplaces, and didn't care or appreciate when I warned them. It's fixed now that state mandates have changed again, but my point stands. These things should be a priority; they should have had staff dedicated to it. MultiCare does not attract the best and brightest. If you are intelligent, hardworking, ambitious--GO ELSEWHERE. \n\nMultiCare failed to prioritize covid vaccination for patients. Processes moved very slowly and patients were not informed of changes to policies and procedures in an organzied manner. Patients were constantly confused and upset because every clinic enforced masking, distancing, and visitation policies differently. I was personally creating handouts to keep patients up to date on where they could get covid vaccines and tests, since Multicare's information was almost always out of date. Why was a receptionist responsible for this? Again, that should have been a priority from above. \n\nPay is abysmal for the workload. Rather than increasing pay and staffing during the pandemic, MultiCare effectivelyi decreased it. I know in my clinic, they took away our front office lead position altogether and asked me to do more work for less pay than our former leads. Just another way to penny pinch! We used to have coffee and water; leadership quickly took this away. Yes, we had to pay for our own drinking water while at work--we pooled money for a water cooler, and took turns buying and lugging in jugs of water from Walmart. This is unacceptable. (It is technically legal since they provide tap water and tap water in Tacoma is safe to drink!) Multicare will screw over employees any way they can as long as it's technically legal, basically. \n\nThey hire new doctors without support staff to help them. One nurse will be doing the work of three nurses. Patients will be scheduled when no one is there to room them or see them. Lines and lobby crowding make it impossible to maintain a six foot distance. It's a safety issue after safety issue, but management doesn't care. Nurses are having emotional breakdowns and doctors are working hours upon hours of uncompensated admin time. \n\nMultiCare will claim they're a not-for-profit hurting for money when they have hundreds of millions in expendable assets. It's a shameful, shameful lie. They could hire and retain more staff if they wanted, but they don't. They will take advantage of your humanity and passion for medicine. You will not be rewarded for hard work. You will be forced to choose between your own sanity and your patients' needs. Please do not work here. \n\nAnd guess what, MultiCare? After you spent six months gaslighting me every time I had a concern, and trying to manipulate me into believing I wasn't worth an extra $1.50/hr, I found a job that pays nearly twice as much! And they even provide luxuries such as filtered water for their staff.

My review is similar to those before me. \r\n\r\nDefinitely under staffed and over worked. At my location \"Puyallup women's center\" we were short staffed by 8 people, they stated the didn't like to use floats. So we took on the role of 1-3 people everyday. \r\nOften times I would work for 2 physicans seeing anywhere from 30-52 patients a day between two providers. \r\n\r\nTriage nursing was lazy, and it was encouraged. They would expect you to do all the nurse visits and work with 2 physicians. \r\n\r\nIf you needed help, they would advise you \"see if someone else can help you, if not do it when you are done\". \r\nThe bonuses sounded like a great incentive, but you soon learned it was tied into in obtainable goals. \r\nOne being that every single employee get vaccinated against the FLU, they do not take into consideration those with allergies or strong views. So though you completed your vaccine, you still didn't meet your goal for the bonus. \r\n\r\nThey encourage you to report any concerns or issues to management. And that there is a zero retaliation, that is 100% not true. I brought up concerns, about a lead RN nothing serious, but confidential. And the next day I was glared at, smart remarks made directly and indirectly at me. \r\nI was I unfriended and blocked on FB by her and several other coworkers following my complaint/ concerns. Which just was that I felt unsupported and she was unapproachable and whom could I go to instead. Turned out to be my worst decision. I stayed for 5 years with the company, and regretted everyday. \r\nAgain management was the issue, the turnover rate was so significant that the leads, and supervisor couldn't handle the stress and all left the clinic in March/ 3016. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on.

My management just cancelled the job postings that had finally gone public because they wanted to move us to 12 hour shifts and those postings had been for 8 hour shifts.\r\n\r\nNote that they are moving us to 12 hour shifts by 'posting' 12 hour jobs for us to apply to internally because they have rebid our department too many times recently and need to avoid doing so again.\r\n\r\nThe result is that one of my crew has had a mandatory double shift three weeks in a row now.  In fact we just had three mandatory double shifts back to back, which violates the union contract.  \r\n\r\nThis was a completely obvious and avoidable problem.  We warned them it would happen, but management didn't care.\r\n\r\nThe well being of the patients and / or staff was of zero concern to them.  Absolutely zero.\r\n\r\nThe 'work around' they proposed was so obviously never going to work it can't even be considered a genuine effort.  \r\n\r\nThe leader that decided to do this can be anticipated to face zero negative consequences, because employee morale and quality of patient care are as important to her bosses as they are to her.  \r\n\r\nI realize this SOUNDS like its just the Tacoma General Telemetry Suite that has problems: it's not.
