I was in 30 minutes prior to my shift and would have made the trip in if they called me, but never did.  They had nothing in writing for me or and specific problems.  Note, I was signing up for healthcare benefits, so how convenient for them to let me go at that time.  So I didn't even had a chance at COBBRA or anything.
