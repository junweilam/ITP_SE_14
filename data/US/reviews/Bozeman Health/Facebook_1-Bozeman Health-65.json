Why can't they support their own with proper education department, a real new grad program, and mandatory sabbaticals for providers? This would make so much sense. CNO needs to walk around the hospital, connect, and understand our strengths and weaknesses. She has made no efforts to understand the situation. This needs to change now. HR is a complete nightmare and needs to be redone completely. Not sure how this is still the case, but please change anything. CEO has driven other hospitals into the ground.
