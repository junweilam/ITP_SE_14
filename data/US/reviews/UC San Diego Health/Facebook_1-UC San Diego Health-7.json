The system is governed by the kingdom philosophy on management, where one person makes the decision that affects everyone else.  UCSD has announced a journey to Magnet in orientation, but that's the last I ever heard about it.  Senior management places significantly more emphasis on physician input than in implementation of policy.  This is contrary to the Magnet journey that is being embraced by leadership.  Management runs healthcare like a business, always concerned about cost, which I acknowledge is an important factor is running a business, but sacrifices patient safety at times, through strict staffing, lack of a primary nursing model and continuity of care.  Labor disputes are common every couple of years while a contract is being negotiated.  They have a labor union for every group of employee, which again can be positive or negative depending on your own perspective.  Work environment can be unit and department specific.  There are units that are great places to work and have excellent management, however there are units that have hostile work environments and have poor managements as well.\r\n\r\nNursing leadership at UCSD is small, weak, poorly structured, and easily influenced by the business management within the leadership team.  This results in business decisions being implemented that doesn't necessarily benefit patient care and is often directed at taken the cost out of the business, often at the expense of patient safety.  Positive feedback is sometimes used, however negative job performance is always communicated.  Nursing leadership is frequently concerned with the bottom line; often they are not supportive of staff.  One of the corporate philosophies at UCSD is service, and frequently obsessed with patient satisfaction.  They are willing to bend over backwards to accommodate this often at the expense of there own employees.  In dealing with errors in the system, they place emphasis on individual punitive disciplinary action versus investigating the root cause analysis of mistakes or errors.\r\n\r\nFurthering your education is mentioned in orientation, but the reality of the situation is that there is no education reimbursement or incentive program to continue your education.  The only education benefit is you receive 30% off tuition at UCSD, which lacks a School of Nursing.  Furthermore, you can't use the program in UCSD Extensions, which is the continuing education arm at UCSD, and in concurrent enrollment, which allows you to take courses without matriculating to the university.
