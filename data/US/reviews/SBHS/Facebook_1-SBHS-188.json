Consistent Untimely creation and implementation of therapeutic programming, if created at all. Lack of understanding of basic ethics and treatment modalities by some clinical staff. Large divides between department directors who are not above publicizing their disdain, while allowing power struggles to compromise patient care. Failure of supervisors and administration to hold employees accountable, leading to frequent staff turn over, dangerous crisis situations, use of restrictive measures and rights restrictions, unrealistic hours and workloads, and patient regression and rehospitalization.

Specifically on the autism unit, most of the kids are aggressive or self-injurious.   It's a very physical job - getting hit, kicked, scratched, bit, head-butted...any type of aggression you can think of, it happens!  You also have to intervene for self injury, such as headbanging.  Then there are other behaviors such as disrobing, rectal digging, and fecal smearing. You have to figure out how to manage the child who is acting out and while keeping the other kids safe, as well as clean up the displaced objects/urine/feces.  What makes dealing with the aggression and self-injury harder is that it feels like administration is very critical, but would be unable to handle the situation themselves.  No recognition is given for all the hard work it takes to keep things running smoothly, but the second something goes wrong (such as needing to have a restrictive measure) then everything gets reviewed and people get in trouble, even when they did the best that anyone could do given the situation.  They do not consider the staff's point of view and consistently try to cut corners (fewer staff, fewer 1:1 patients, floating none-core staff to the unit while cancelling core staff) which makes managing crises very difficult for the staff.\r\n- Staffing.  Units are staffed to the bare minimum of the hospital's policy, not considering acuity.  For the autism unit it's 1 staff to 3 patients, and it's 1:4 for the other units.  This number includes the nurse.  So what ends up happening is you can have up to 8 kids by yourself because the nurse spends most of his/her time in the nurse's station.  It's dangerous, and I'm amazed staffing policy has not been changed to address acuity/need for ADL assistance.  \r\n- Everything is \"census driven.\"  This means that when there are not as many patients, staff get cancelled and get short paychecks.  When there are too many patients, they push you to do overtime on the weekend, but then cancel you during the week so that you do not get overtime pay. \r\n- Good staff are overlooked, while people who slack off are  recognized.  It takes A LOT to get fired, which is not okay when your job is to ensure the safety and welfare of children."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Mental Health Counselor/Therapist", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Mental Health Therapist in Streamwood, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The population that we help is very interesting and presents the opportunity to help some of the most needy.
