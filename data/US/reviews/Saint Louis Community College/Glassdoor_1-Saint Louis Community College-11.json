It's not overly stressful. The work you do is satisfying and feels useful/important to the overall success of the college.

In some ways you are your own boss when it comes to how you solve a programming problem.",

Also with being your own boss in terms of how you program, this can be a downside as a lot of code between departments is inconsistent and not standardized. This is being improved every year though. Salary can be lower than other companies out there as well."
