Growth: I grew exponentially at Horizon and now know \u201cWhat Not To Do\u201d in the Human Services field. This has shaped the rest of my career.", "cons": "1. Company Diversity- Completely disproportionate to the population Horizon assists. A large number of counselors (to no fault of their own) are white women fresh out of grad school with little experience. Upper management and Senior Staff consist of white women who are detached and desensitized to the needs of both the community and \u201clower-tier\u201d employees. Upper management works far from any low-income location, and acts accordingly. Very high turnover rate for Black employees.\r\n\r\n2. Workload- Impossible and relentless. The boundaries of the Administrative Assistant position expand with every turnover. Turnovers are expected, not addressed, and are usually a result of poor management and prolonged fatigue/rage. Several locations are severely understaffed. Management takes full advantage of new staff and prioritizes pride and image over staff well-being. Supervision meetings are futile, and you\u2019ll be asked why you can\u2019t handle an unreasonable workload, not whether the workload is even necessary. I had 150,000 emails in a year and a half. Not worth $14.10 an hour.\r\n\r\n3. Management- Extremely suppressive, passive-aggressive, unprofessional, and narcissistic. Conflicts are not resolved unless you take it to Employee Services, which managers do not advise. Management promotes \u201cyes men\u201d who won\u2019t question them. RNs are put on a pedestal, paid extravagantly, and get away with murder. For months, front staff was outwardly bullied by a counselor and an RN, to which management repeatedly responded, \u201cWe\u2019re working on it.\u201d I addressed it myself and was written up. Every problem is met with band-aid solutions and severe gaslighting. You are a mule in this company.\r\n\r\n4. Benefits- Abysmal for a generally healthy person. I paid $200 a month for a $4000 deductible I didn\u2019t need. Annual raises were put off for months \u201cdue to COVID.\" Finally, we received a mandatory inflation raise passed off as our performance raise. I ended up making less per paycheck when I quit than when I started.\r\n\r\n5. Services- Low-quality despite some amazing counselors. Horizon does not understand or care for the value of Trauma-Informed Care (prioritizing patients\u2019 safety, choice, empowerment, collaboration, intersectionality, and trust), and actively counters some of these principles, which is a huge disservice to \u201cover 22,000 Western New Yorkers a year.\u201d Patients must jump through hoops to discontinue services or switch counselors. Long-term medication dependency (the company's money-maker) is a first resort. Even the word \"patient\" is disempowering. Patients are severely enabled until they are dependent on the company. When I discussed this with my supervisor, I was told, \"Enabling is just going to happen in this field.\" There are Human Services employers in the area who respect those they help; this is not one of them.\r\n\r\nOverall, Horizon Health Services is a corrupt, tone-deaf, Medicaid-milking organization with a savior complex.
