All the articles on their intranet are full of comments from people begging for wage increases as most people I know there have to work second or third jobs and they are still losing money each pay cycle. Management is out of touch and you can consistently hear them on calls insisting on keeping raises and salaries \"as conservative as possible\". Most people in my department have gone to management explaining how they work multiple jobs and still cannot afford groceries, but they will flat out ignore this and focus on different things that you are saying and completely sweep your concerns under the rug. People are leaving at a high rate, and staffing is extremely short- you will be very over-worked. Meanwhile, the top earners in the company are making more than the surrounding hospitals, as the \"little people\" earn less than the competitors. CCF continues to grow and expand and invest money in new locations despite not having the resources or money to staff their current hospitals due to their worker shortage. And in institutional meetings, management will say things about how they need to focus on hiring physicians and that the support staff who \"aren't doing anything\" can pick up the slack and stop being lazy and take on more responsibilities. Personally, as support staff, most days I do not even have time to take a lunch, but my manager will reprimand me for this, so I allow them to commit wage theft every day I clock out and lie and say I received a lunch. I also cannot fit my normal work obligations into only 40 hrs a week, so this is also necessary for that purpose. My manager boasted to me in interviews that she looks for ways to promote so I could grow and develop in this company, yet since I've been there, the only people who have been promoted were people who were threatening to leave the job due to issues like pay, and were then promoted to try to keep them. I was also lied to in interviews and told I would be doing things in my actual interest area, only to find out that this would never happen. I am working lead on 4 studies, spending a lot of time helping out 2 other studies, and trying to get more up and running as a coordinator 1 level with only 1 year on the job. I am doing the work of a coordinator 2, and applied for the position of a coordinator 2, but they put me at a 1 level upon hire and kept my duties and obligations the same just as a way to save money and keep me underpaid. I have been at the clinic 5 total years and have switched departments multiple times thinking the next department would be better, but these are company wide issues. When jumping 4 pay grades from a promotion, my salary only went up $2/hour. Overall, my projection for the clinic is extremely negative. Maybe one day they will realize their employees are leaving at a mass rate due to under appreciation, under staffing, over working, and under paying, but until then, I would not recommend coming onboard."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Cleveland Clinic Job Review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Patient Service Specialist in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The only way you will love your job a the CC is only if you have amazing, caring and passionate hire ups.", "cons": "Every department at CC is extremely short staffed so there will be a lot of things you have to do that your job does not describe if you"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Overall, Okay.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Nursing Assistant in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I worked with great coworkers that helped each other when needed.

The micromanaging in this department is INSANE. All of the managers were biased, rude, and played \"favorites\" with certain employees. There was even a time where they were trying to get me in trouble for things that weren't even my fault and I truly believe it was because they wanted to push my to my breaking point until I quit. They probably just didn't want to pay for unemployment so this was their next best strategy. The rules for the calls during the workday were totally unrealistic. We constantly felt \"damned if we do, damned if we don't\" with many of the tasks during the day. If you worked here, you know exactly what im talking about. The pay is pathetic for the amount of work they have you do during the day. I worked full time and could barely afford even half of my bills. Some people only worked here for the good health insurance. Oh, and if you think you are going to \"stick to it until you move up into a better position\", youre very mistaken. There is no moving up from the appointment center. They have a rule that you have to work for a minimum of 2 years before you can apply to other departments in the hospital (unless you are fortunate enough to get an exception from your manager). I worked there while completing my Master's degree with the hopes of finding a better position after I graduated. I quickly learned that it was never going to happen unless your best friends with the boss.

However this was a job where there was no expectation or compensation for working this many hours overtime. Overtime I started finding out that they did not compensate fairly not only for myself for the overtime hours but that they also don\u2019t adjust pay in a timely manner for experience. The new people they hire in at market rate can be hire than people who have worked with for them for years. This was for doctors as well as entry level jobs. I think they need to understand where they stand in terms of compensation before they demand this type of workload. On a non monetary standpoint there is no set progression. You can only advance if a position opens up.

Everyone who works here knows it. During the pandemic, upper management refused to allow caregivers to wear N95s, even when access to proper PPE was widely available. They only just NOW (July of 2021) are letting all caregivers who work WITH COVID+ PATIENTS wear N95s, and that's only because OSHA is mandating it. They watched silently as the entire staff of many units became ill with the virus, some never to return. They literally watched caregivers die because of refusing to let them have the same PPE their epidemiologists preached was needed when in contact with COVID positive patients. All while insisting everyone was getting sick through contact outside of the hospital- which we all know is a blatant lie. I don't understand how somehow this hospital is ranked consistently in the top 3 nationwide. They bill home health as inpatient to cut loopholes to earn more money and have the employees work holidays. They pay the lowest in the area. The turnover in every department is incredibly high- I only know a small handful of people who stay here beyond 2 or 3 years. Management is fake and talks about people behind their backs; they clearly do not care about the wellbeing of their employees. We were offered NO hazard pay, which many other hospitals were able to do. All we got was a \"generous gift\" of $500 for working through the pandemic that was taxed as a gift instead of a bonus so we only received about half of that about (of course they want to be able to use that for their tax returns). I've had management talk about my PHI openly in teams meetings with the entire department in front of me. The level of disrespect is unreal.
