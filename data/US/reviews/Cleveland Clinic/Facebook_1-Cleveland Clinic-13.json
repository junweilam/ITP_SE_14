High turn over, which I believe is due to short staff, heavy work load, possibly poor management. There is an employee handbook within which all the rules are listed however, the employee handbook also states that All rules are by managers discretion which can lead to partiality. One example of Managers Discretion: at the Cleveland Clinic 36 hrs is considered full time however there is a manager on a cardiac step down unit that allows 36 hrs to be full time for nursing staff only, not for PCNA (nurse aids/assistants) they must work 40 hrs to be full time. To my knowledge, no other manager does this. That falls under \"Managers Discretion\"  Point system is also many times not fair for everyone do to Managers discretion but this is how it should work, Points system: 18 pts for 40hrs 16 pts for 36hrs.  One call off is 3pts +1pt if you call off the second day in a row. -1pt if you punch in early and -1pt for punching out late. No sick days so pts add up fast which will put you in corrective action. When in corrective action you can not post for other positions."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Registered Nurse-main campus, specialty unit", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great resources, great health insurance if needed, #2 hospital!

Dress code for lab- No Denims. \n\nDon't be surprised if you find cockroaches in your drawer and flies flying in the lab. Your lab may get to more than 78 F most often. That is normal. \n\nYour lab is so noisy due to the old Refrigerators of department on the alley way, that everyone in that room gets headache by 2pm of the day. You as well as your PI requests for solution. Nothing happens. by the way, I am sure the noise level decibel os higher than the standard to be considered Occupational hazard. \nNeed to order a reagent of your choice which you things works good for you. You have to order and buy only the reagents which is available on the Lawson system. You can't order anything outside their database. You are lucky if you find alternative in their database. Forget about discount coupons you may have. You can't use that to save some money for your lab. You pay the fixed price on Lawson, which is the highest rate (not the Institutional rate  that is cheaper than MSRP).\n\nRetirement benefits: You don't get any in the 1st year. From 2nd year only you are considered employee, hence get employee benefit. \n\nYou have employee \"Dental insurance\" but the CCF hospital don't accept that insurance. Then why do you give that sort of insurance to your employee. \n\nEmployee appreciation/motivation:  You will get 2 cookies/ year as a employee appreciation. \n\nOther than that, outside work, Cleveland is a NOISY city.

Wrong. Got booted last week for parking in a \"staff\" spot...public safety told me it was supposed to say \"physician parking only.\"\r\n\r\nFloating...don't even get me started.

They will then \"re-organize\", change your job title, and hire someone else to do your same job at a much lower rate.  \r\nIf you have family or a significant other, instruct them to call the insurer immediately if you need an ambulance or to be seen at an out of network hospital.  Ignore the written agreement. The reality is that they will refuse  to pay and then stick you with the entire bill.  Yes, even if it is a true emergency. I'm not  making this up.
