Afterwards, a slew of good people were forced out of their positions (they were offered early retirement, given a pink-slip if they didn't accept early retirement, or if a CDH and Delnor position was filled, Delnor staff always were cut). Job turnover is high in non-nursing areas (nursing had seemed to be shielded from the initial onslaught, but is now feeling the pressure). Whole physician practices have left the organization; several of those that have joined are bitter about having done so. The \"Cadence Ax\" of cutting people from Delnor has become so prevalent, that HR has a pre-made discharge packet in envelopes, ready to hand out to staff at a second's notice. Some Delnor employees are being let go on whims of CDH-management rather than on merit. \r\n\r\nAlso, Craig Livermore has not been the CEO for quite some time."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "ER/PCT", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Pct in Geneva, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to learn.
