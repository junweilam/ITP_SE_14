Emory, please respect humaneness.\r\n I used to work at in patient unit of Spine Hospital located at Monterial Road. I worked there for more than 5 years. I quit the job because I see so much discrimination against Nurse with foreign background. I initially thought situation will improve but its getting worst. Nurse tech often ignore request for help or doesn't collaborate well with immigrant nurse or new nurse staff. I have often seen them spending time on cell phone watching stuff but they just pretend to be very busy when asked for help but in reality I have seen them in social media. Nursing admin-management ignore when informed whats going on . There is discrimination in job scheduling . I have seen many times that some nurses are assigned only 2 patients while other are force to take 5 patients or more in the bedside care with no Nurse Tech. There is groupism shown by the fact that they o have tea meeting every morning . The monthly schedule is moved all over the place for some nurses as oppose to some Nurses getting their schedule as they wish and work only very few weekend. if you are insider you are good and if you are outsider good luck if you are thinking bout working there. when there is staff shortage Nurses are not allowed to tell that they are short staffed and work without break for water,lunch and restroom break. it sucks to work there. They never approve vacation more than 2 weeks. you can imagine if you are originally from Asia or Africa or other part of the globe."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Getting better - a ways to go.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Coordinator in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Getting way better than what use to be years ago.", "cons": "Archaic in some areas, has a ways to go."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Asministrative Assistant in Decatur, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The 403b matching is excellent.", "cons": "So many systems for basic functions."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Proud to be with Emory", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Advanced Practice Provider (PA/NP) in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- pathology and ability to treat difficult disease processes \r\n- team \r\n- autonomy", "cons": "- management\r\n- losing staff to overburden of work from Covid-19"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Got a love it", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Med Assistant in Covington, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One supervisor great .

As the economy has improved, Emory Healthcare is doing quite well, quietly and successfully merging and acquiring St. Jos., Johns Creek, Clark Holder, and opening numerous satellite clinics. In spite of this, there has been no discussion of restoring what the employees gave up when times were tougher for the company. In fact, employee benefits, healthcare in particular (ironically), continue to be cut, while salaries are becoming more stagnant. Emory gets big tax breaks for their not for profit status, and is expected in return to give back to the community by providing charitable care. They give some, but not nearly what they should.

Disorganized and chaotic with unclear expectations, especially with a brand new work flow in place for the nurses. PTO/holidays/sick time is all one bucket, so PTO can go very fast. Physicians are not held accountable to respond in a timely manner which makes it challenging for nursing to help patients and do their jobs when physician input is needed. Some physicians/APPs are completely disrespectful to staff. Before you accept a job with Emory, I encourage you to ask questions regarding the culture of the department and perhaps even ask for a \"working interview\" to see for yourself if that is a department you want to work in.

There are no health options and it requires you to pay high premiums for a high deductible plan. \r\n\r\nThe work itself is extremely high stress and does not allow for reasonable breaks. If you have to go to the bathroom outside of your scheduled breaks (which are determined by your manager the day of, and change day to day), then it will affect your call scores and overall job performance. For someone who drinks the standard amount of water during the day to stay healthy, I found this to be totally ridiculous and unmanageable. \r\n\r\nAll this being said, I had very high call scores and was considered for committees and leadership roles. I was in good standing with the organization when I left and kept in contact with my supervisor. I take work responsibilities seriously and have a very strong work ethic. I've managed large facilities and have over 10 years of work experience. Despite this, the unhealthy levels of stress endured at this job was unlike anything I've ever experienced before and after. You sit in the same spot for very long periods of time, staring at computer screens and can not get up or move around when you want. The call standards are high and you often have to sacrifice care of the patient for your scores. They very much restrict the help you can give to patients and much of the time you feel like you aren't helping at all. The patients are frustrated with you because you can't directly connect them with anyone, but take messages for them. When you do try to contact nurses and staff at the clinic for emergencies, they aren't particularly happy to hear from you.  Sometimes you endure abuse not only from patients but from other Emory Healthcare employees. When you take breaks and get up and move around, is determined by your supervisor. If you want a standing desk,  there are only a few of those and it seemed to be designated for people who were at the organization longer.

That's why Emory Healthcare recently launched a training for employees and management: how to be civil at work... \r\n\r\nMany employees I know either quit due to hostile work environment or went on FMLA to cope with abuse. Emory has FSAP - faculty staff assistance program, which is dedicated to working with abused employees.\r\n\r\nI endured hostility, went on FMLA, and my manager requested my colleagues to remove the records of my work.  He then  falsified personal employment file after I resigned due to hostile work environment, with falsified date and reason. \r\n\r\n\r\n>>FORCED FMLA: I found out from many of my Emory colleagues how much hostility and abuse they have endured.
