Many people fail to show up to meetings and if they do show up they show up without their work done, which prevents anything from actually occurring. \r\n\r\nMeetings - to many of them, it feels like administration purposefully keeps themselves and management in so many meetings in order to insulate themselves from real issues.\r\n\r\nCommunication - not to good for some departments. Literally some departments thought a report was functioning in error for 7 months because their supervisor never told them why it printed the way it did. This is a two fold problem, supervision not communicating a necessary change in process to help with better and more directed care and support staff being/feeling to ineffectual to even ask why things are happening.\r\n\r\nCulture - There are some really good players, but they leave the institution due to failing administration and department heads. A lot of staff that should not be there due to ineptitude and poor attitude remain and get promoted...One example of a complaining not getting with the program staff is when a former executive was giving a speech on trying to change the culture to be more hospitable, he was telling a story about how a nurse aide was listening to what he thought was P-Diddy (who cares who it really was), but the message was this person was totally despondent towards the care of the patient and the only thing this nurse took from that story was \"He said she was listening to P-Diddy\" and she complained to the exec team about it, people with that attitude should not be working there, fire them, they are a downfall to the hospital.\r\n\r\nCleanliness - it's bad, I could not go there a single day without seeing garbage on the floors, dirty floors, cracked floors and tiles, this is what patients need to recoup in? Very poor image\r\n\r\nInformation - stop trying to hide it. Example, the hospital applied and received a $5 million plus grant, but had refused to tell employees that, by the way it was on the local news so it's not exactly  super secret information. This information was out for months before I left and administration still never made it public.
