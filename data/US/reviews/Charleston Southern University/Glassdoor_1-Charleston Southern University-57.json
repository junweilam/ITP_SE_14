I was even told it was a \"conservative\" environment. This is absurd. Charleston SC is a major tourist town. You won't do most of those things once you live here. The traffic in this area is far worse than Atlanta or LA. I've visited both many times. Charleston may be smaller, but it's incredibly common for it take 90 minutes to get 15 miles. Additionally, the Charleston area is the most expensive city in the state of SC. The thought that faculty have to live off a $55k salary in a city where home prices start at $350k for mediocre neighborhoods next to horrible public schools is the expectation of the CSU administration. Many of the reviews on glassdoor mention how horrible the management is and they're right. This school's administration is incompetent. I've had many tasks given to me last minute, asked to head into meetings with no warning and there always seems to be another task they add to our workload. Getting through a week working less than 65 hours is a major accomplishment after you teach 4 classes, fulfill all your committee assignments and spend endless hours advising, advising, advising. I currently have more than 50 students who need me for scheduling help. Probably the worst part of the job is how few of my colleagues are Christians. If you give some mediocre fluff on your interview with some Christianeeze mixed in you'll breeze through it. They will never confirm there is anything actually Christian going on in your life. So don't let the Christian moniker fool you. You don't have to be one to work here. I have many colleagues that are open socialists and would demonize people for thinking differently. Faculty disappear here all the time. I started about 5-10 years ago and we had about 15 faculty at the orientation my starting semester. I think there's only 4 of us left. As I have learned from my dean, the administration loves this. It helps them fight wage gains when they can get rid of faculty and get new faculty that don't have families because they'll offer them lower wages. If you're one of those young faculty who's okay with only affording a small studio apartment in town, this might be a great school to get started after grad school. But be warned. Nothing you do has any relevance to your teaching advancement other than student evaluations. I have now witnessed multiple colleagues get fired when students figure out they can get together and give multiple bad reviews for a course. If it's in a student eval, it's automatically considered true. ALWAYS. These were hard working professors that cared about their craft. CSU will not give you a chance to improve. You'll just get a terminal contract and they'll kick you out the door, making way for someone younger, cheaper and more progressive. The Christian label is only designed to extract as many donation dollars out of the Southern Baptists as they can."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "You can not survive working here.
