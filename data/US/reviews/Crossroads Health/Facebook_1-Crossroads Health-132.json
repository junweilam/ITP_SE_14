There was a comment that cuts needed to be made, but the fact is that people are constantly in a state of panic and if they will have a job, staff continues to be overworked, and there are no incentives, or increases even projected to happen. Upper management is delusional at best about the \"outlook\" of the agency, and only seems to be worried about the bottom dollar since huge mistakes were made. They are not worried about solving the solution or taking cuts themselves, but rather cutting direct care professionals that actually bring profit in, not sitting in an office trying to figure out how to justify their decisions. If there wasn't four levels of management and supervisors then maybe there would actually be enough staff to see client's.
