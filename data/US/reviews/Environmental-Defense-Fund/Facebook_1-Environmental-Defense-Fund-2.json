Working at a nonprofit dealing with climate change definitely feels like positive karma     \r\n\r\n- Offices are nice and website looks nice. EDF is well funded", "cons": "What I\u2019m going to say won\u2019t be pretty, but needs to be said. If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m guessing that you are someone who cares about the environment and climate change, and wants to make a difference. That\u2019s what led me to EDF before I learned all of this. Here\u2019s why I believe you should look elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany cons have been touched upon already, so I won\u2019t spend too much time on them.     \r\n- Lack of diversity and high turnover in the HR department [see review on 10/16/2018]     \r\n\r\n- Different treatment of people working in the \u201cprograms\u201d (basically people who do the science, research, or advocacy work) and people working in \u201coperations\u201d (people who do everything else that keeps the nonprofit running) [10/31/2018]\r\n\r\nThe following things are bigger issues that have been touched upon less. It took me over a year at EDF to gradually figure these out. The big two that were most important for me are:     \r\n\r\n- Slow career progression: This will be especially relevant if you are young, ambitious, and itching to make a difference in your career. Career growth is slow and most of the work for lower-level employees just isn\u2019t very interesting, challenging, or important. During my time at EDF, I felt strong cognitive dissonance between the company\u2019s big-picture mission and the pointlessness of my day-to-day duties. From talking with others, this was a common feeling.     \r\n\r\n- Lack of talent: Job satisfaction depends a LOT on the quality of the people you are surrounded by (especially your direct boss), how much responsibility you\u2019re able to take on, and your rate of learning. The reality of how the world works is that money is important and non-profits do not pay very well, so they\u2019re not able to attract the best talent. For me personally, the lower pay was a tradeoff I was willing to make (and did make), but it wasn\u2019t until later that I realized pay is also a proxy for how much the organization values you, how much responsibility they give you, and the quality of the people you will be surrounded by. These are far more important, and should not be overlooked.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the other issues I saw can be traced back to the unavoidable fact that nonprofits, even ones as well-funded as EDF, are dependent on funding. In EDF\u2019s case, funding comes from individual donors and foundations. I believe this is the source of, or at the very least contributes to, all sorts of interesting phenomena.     \r\n\r\n- Too self-congratulatory: I have never come across a company with stronger corporate kool-aid than EDF. There\u2019s a lot of patting oneself and each other on the back going on. Admittedly, EDF does get wins like publishing a new study on methane or challenging one of President Trump\u2019s many anti-environment antics in court\u2026but the level of celebration makes you think that they solved climate change already. Alas, we have a long way to go (~400 years at our current rate, according to a March 2018 MIT technology review article). I understand that celebrating wins is necessary for employee morale and keeping the donors happy, but it feels excessive and there\u2019s a level of critical self-reflection on what could be done better that\u2019s missing.     \r\n\r\n- Pointless work that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere: A lot of work seems like it\u2019s only being done for the sake of it, with not enough attention paid to ROI and whether it SHOULD be done. For example, a lot of time is spent writing blog posts, adding to EDF\u2019s website, and making pretty maps and graphs that very few people will ever look at.     \r\n\r\n- Generally too much emphasis on form over substance: There was a ton of buzz about the \u201cnext wave of environmentalism\u201d at the company\u2019s annual retreat \u2013 basically, harnessing new tech like AI, blockchain, IOT, etc. to advance environmental issues. Not a bad idea, but people are doing it already in academia and industry (see: Silicon Valley), and it seems like these are more buzzwords for EDF than actionable goals.     \r\n\r\n- Inefficient use of resources: EDF does not have an endowment, so dollars in must equal dollars out at the end of the fiscal year. This leads to lavish spending in the form of office renovations, flying people in to give talks, long lunches at expensive restaurants, etc. This was a bit of a bummer because the money is coming out of donors\u2019 pockets, and one can\u2019t help but feel that it could be put to better use with increasing pay, attracting better talent, advancing new initiatives, or any number of other areas.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA final word on career paths and the tradeoffs of EDF:\r\nAny job has tradeoffs. In my mind, EDF\u2019s allure of making a difference just isn\u2019t worth it for junior employees when balanced against the limited responsibility, talent, rate of learning, and career progression. This is why I would not work there, and why I think you too should look elsewhere. There is a place for EDF and other nonprofits in the world, but if you\u2019re young, smart and ambitious, you will find a more fulfilling and impactful career elsewhere.     \r\n\r\nBy nature of not being the final decision maker and having limited funding, there is only so much that nonprofits such as EDF can do. Climate change is one of the biggest problems of our time, and deep decarbonization of energy will require both deploying existing technologies at massive scale (solar, wind, storage, etc) and developing, commercializing, and deploying technologies that do not yet exist (long duration energy storage, cheap and reliable nuclear, etc). Any number of other paths would be more \u201cimpactful\u201d for the environment over the course of a lifetime than EDF. I put my money where my mouth is and urge you to do the same."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Driven and smart staff; excellent mission", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Senior Manager in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff are smart, driven and really care about making the world a better place.

They view themselves as rainmakers, when, in reality, they're mostly just standing outside the halls of power shouting inanely.

Staff scurried around busily for weeks in prep for trial, thinking they were on the cusp of victory over the evil agencies.  After our counsel got crushed in court by the agency SMEs, they consoled themselves by reassuring us all that we were fighting nobly against evil polluters, even though the agency folks were at least as committed to environmental quality as anyone on our staff. \n\nEDF staff often loses in fights against government entities because they're blinded by their own arrogance.  They think because they have a law degree or a bachelor's from Brown that the state is going to forfeit their position out of fear.  In reality, we usually went to trial against SMEs who were at least as educated as our staff, and certainly more steeped in policy, given that they wrote it.  And there was scant little effort to engage agency staff in discussion as people.  I pushed for this, knowing that having some friendly contacts in government would have helped us immensely to understand policy and the soft spots in it.   Moreover, I knew we needed to recruit some agency folks to come work on our side and bring their insider's knowledge with them.  Nothing would have helped us more.\n\nAs it was, management seemed content to lose case after case in the district and administrative law courts.
