This is a fact that can be verified by reading the Forbes magazine article \"Dawn of the Dead: For Hundreds of the nations private colleges its merge or perish\"\r\n \r\n1.) Inferior facilities:  UB's buildings were mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s, and many of them have not been renovated to keep up with the Internet and new technologies. Some of the buildings, frankly, need to be torn down. To renovate them would cost at least $50-75 million in funds that UB does not have.\r\n\r\n2.) Inferior teaching:  Many of the faculty at UB are part-time (60-70%) and get paid VERY low salaries ($3,000 total for one full semester = approx. less than $10 per hour). Most of the nearby colleges and universities in CT pay their part-time faculty at least $5,000 per class. This means that the BEST faculty go and teach at those other universities.  UB only has about 140 full-time faculty for nearly 5,000 students = 35 students for each full-time faculty.  Most other universities have DOUBLE that amount, meaning that the students at those schools get more attention, mentoring, and higher quality instruction. A full-time professor gets paid about $50-60,0000 per year starting, so if UB wanted to hire 140 new full-time faculty, they would need $8.4 millions dollars more each year in income. Most other colleges in CT pay higher, so the best will go somewhere else whenever they can. This has already been happening over the past 2-3 years and will continue!\r\n\r\n3.) Inferior Services:  Most of the offices for different student services (career services, study abroad, student activities, etc.) are offices with only ONE employee.  This means that even if those employees are fantastic, they cannot keep up with all of the needs of the students.  Also, they are paid around $40,000 per year! Many of the long-time staff members at UB, like the 22-year veteran Dean of Students, were fired without cause over the past 1-2 years by the new president, meaning their loyalty to UB and expertise was also lost. That is irreplaceable\r\n\r\n4.) Inferior finances: The University of Bridgeport has been running a $5-6 million dollar deficit for the past 3-4 years and surely will run a huge deficit this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent estimates place their losses at $12-15 millon!\r\n\r\n5.) Inferior Alumni network: The University of Bridgeport has a VERY WEAK alumni network, for some very specific historical reasons -\r\n\r\n In 1990-91, UB had the longest faculty strike in the history of any college or university, leading the firing of almost all of the faculty and staff. The student body from the 1980s-early 1990s were small and many of them were ignored in the following 25 years (1991-2016) because the university almost closed and had NO  FUNCTIONAL ALUMNI OFFICE UNTIL 2016.\r\n\r\n UB was led by the Unification Movement, a \"church\" founded by Sun Yung Moon in Korea in the 1950s-1960s since 1992. The Unificationists are very loyal to Rev. Moon, who they believe is the second coming of Jesus. In the 1970s they gained a bad reputation, so when they paid $100 million to bail out UB in 1992, the majority alumni from the 1960s-1990s were NOT HAPPY, and have not supported UB ever since. The Unification movement made a deal with UB that their children could study at UB for free, but many of those unificationist alumni give their money to the church after graduation, NOT to UB.\r\n\r\nUB alumni since 1995-2016 have been a combination of unificationists, international students, and domestic students from low-income backgrounds.  The unificationists will not donate to UB because they give to their church and now they are offended by the fact that Trombley purged them and their parents and friends from UB .  International students do not come from countries with a culture of donating money to their alumni institutions, so they do not and will not give money to UB.  Low-income domestic students often do not graduate from UB, have huge amounts of student debt, and do not gain high levels of employment, so they will not give back to UB. \r\n\r\nBottom Line:\r\n\r\nUB needs at least $60-90 million in EXTRA funding immediately just to renovate facilities and hire more staff and faculty to be competitive with peer institutions, and they need to balance the current budget and stop losing $5-6 million per year. UB's money comes almost entirely from TUITION, so if less students come (enrollment dropped every year since 2017), where is the money going to come from? International students most likely will not return in Fall 2020, and domestic enrollment is dropping."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "student worker", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bridgeport, CT", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have learnt how to team work and get my work done before deadline.
