Access to many educational resources all over campus.  Tuition deferment. Made lifelong friendships with some amazing, brilliant, way too patient co-workers.", "cons": "From when I started there in 2005 until the end of 2010, I loved my job there.  However, when they implemented a big restructuring/reorganization in 2011 in my department, it went downhill fast.  The morale in my department and overall attitude on campus has become so tense to the point that I could no longer tolerate being near these people.  Campus has now become nothing more than a battle ground of class warfare between faculty versus staff.  It is a great employer if you're a tenured faculty member, but it's a horrible place to work if you're a staff member, a contract professional, or PT faculty member.  They keep chipping away at the benefits and don't give raises or advancement opportunities to staff, but faculty get raises, promotions, extra benefits that staff don't get, and are treated like gods - so they, in turn, feel entitled to treat all their subordinates with a ridiculous amount of disrespect, even though many staff has just as much (if not more!) education than their so-called \"superiors.\"  Staff are the backbone of that university and keep that place running--they are dedicated and hard-working, yet are underpaid and unappreciated, especially in my department\r\n\r\nManagers there are extremely immature and selfish, and are neither sympathetic or empathetic to others outside of their \"circle.\"  Most are opportunist ladder-climbers who were only nice to those whom they felt could advance their careers.  Since I was nothing more to them than their slave, they certainly treated me as such!  They demand the utmost respect from staff, but don't give any respect in return to staff.  I was yelled at repeatedly for things that were out of my control; had my intelligence insulted publicly at a meeting; had the phone hung up on me when my boss was mad that something didn't go her way despite how hard I tried to fix a bad situation that SHE created; witnessed my supervisor having many \"tantrums\" where she would stomp around the office suite slamming doors, pound her fist on the conference table, and use such vile swearing language; and they would often ignore meetings that I would arrange (not show up or call ahead of time to let me know they wouldn't be there while I sat in the empty conference room waiting for them!), but they would yell at me if I was one minute late to one of their meetings (even if it was because I was busy assisting a student!).  Respect was obviously not a 2-way street in their eyes!\r\n\r\nIt's plainly obvious that some of these faculty have severe mental health issues, but everyone in my circle was terrified to ever defend themselves whenever they were unjustly attacked because they were worried about losing their jobs.  I can understand that the faculty have a lot on their plate too (although the faculty in my department don't even deal directly with the students anymore, so who knows what they're up to all day in their offices behind closed doors--that is, if they ever even show up for work!  Most would come in late and leave early, and/or take long lunch breaks, and never put in a 40 hour work week like the staff, which is extremely unfair!).  No matter how bad of a day you're having, there is NO justification for taking your anger out on someone else.  I would never dream of treating even an animal the way they treated their staff!!  \r\n\r\nThere were so many brilliant staff that aren't given duties or projects that coincided with their skills and abilities.  Such a waste!  It was always the same faculty members on all the important committees (you'd rarely see a staff member on a search committee).  Managers are jealous, insecure control freaks who feel threatened by anyone below them with a brain, so they either degrade them until they quit or lose all of their self-worth.  Faculty make snap decisions all the time but would often not communicate them (the running joke is that we didn't know a new rule existed until we got yelled at for breaking it!), but staff have no say in any decisions made.  They are often vindictive, conniving, tyrannical, abuse their power, and burn bridges with their nasty behavior.  They are often disorganized and blame everyone but themselves for their bad decisions.  I was never praised for all the good and hard work I did, but you can bet I was crucified for the rare mistake I would make.  When my boss had an error that she had clearly made (and couldn't pawn off on someone else) pointed out to her, she merely giggled and said \"my bad!\" but if I made a mistake, she would brow-beat me and say how it was \"unacceptable\" and \"made the department look bad.\"  Likewise, I was never thanked for any of their huge mistakes that I caught and fixed, or given any credit for all the good ideas I had that they implemented--they shamelessly took all the credit themselves!  They behaved just liked schoolyard bullies!  I often felt like I was adult and they were the children, and yet the children were in charge and I could never discipline them no matter how much they misbehaved!! You just couldn't do anything right.  I would often go home crying every night and had high blood pressure, insomnia, and anxiety attacks.  After almost 9 years there (I had planned to be a \"lifer\" at that employer) I eventually had to quit at the advice of my doctor who said that if I stayed in such a high-risk environment any longer, I could risk having a heart attack or stroke, and UA is certainly not worth dying for!!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "A great place to go to school and to work!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Sept 2012", "job_title": "Community Assistant in Akron, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love working on campus because everything's close, the people are always friendly and hours work around your school schedule.", "cons": "Night shifts aren't the best but not that bad and I wish everyone wasn't so strict."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "A place dedicated to serving the student", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Nov 2012", "job_title": "Senior Lecturer in Orrville, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "UA provides great technology for students and instructors.
