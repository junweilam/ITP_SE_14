Benefits are incredible, but the people and culture are equally amazing. Chapa-De isn't one of those companies that says the things they're supposed to say and then forgets about them. The company leadership lives our values and maintains encouraging, supportive and open communication with all of our staff. There is genuine concern and attention to employee happiness and work/life balance, as well as patient care. I have found the staff at all levels genuinely care about the work they're doing and the people they're helping. I go to work feeling great because I know that what I'm doing really helps people and that is much more than most can say. This may impact me more than others as my entire career had been in the for profit sector, so the primary concern was always making money. The change to a focus on helping people is exactly how I want to finish my career and Chapa-De is giving me that opportunity. I really can't say enough good things about working there. For me, a dream job.", "cons": "Honestly, none. I sat here thinking that I HAVE to put down at least one con or this review will look fake. Well, I simply don't have any.
