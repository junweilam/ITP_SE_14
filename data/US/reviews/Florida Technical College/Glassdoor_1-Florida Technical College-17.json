FTC by far gives the for-profit sector a bad name. If you want to work for an institution that encompasses zero empathy for students, faculty and staff. Has poor, standards, overwhelmed leadership, staff, and instructors please read my lengthy review below. \n\nWhen I was hired out of state I was lead to believe by the FTC leadership team in the main campus in Orlando (President, Executive Director and Vice Presidents and Head Academic Dean) that FTC was growing when in reality they were actively eliminating positions company wide. A companies goal is to grow out of hard financial problems while FTC was cutting their way out of it.  I\u2019ve worked in ethical and compliant for-profit colleges for 12 years now so I knew when I heard this it was bad news. Cutting is a desperate measure not a position anyone should come into.  I would not have moved and  taken the position if I was not lied to. \n\nLeadership asked me to move across the U.S and it was at a great personal expense for myself and family with no relocation assistance by FTC. Three short months after, I was told my job was eliminated. I was asked to leave immediately and was not given a severance. Just a thank you for your service.  Not a common practice in any reputable business.  Left me and my family in a sickening financial situation which were still trying to recover today.  I was also new to the state so unemployment was not an option.  \n\nIn the month I arrived FTC converted all Associate and BA programs to solely online (they were blended before). They cut all directors at their campuses over the Florida region. The dean and directors job in Orlando was to absorb all online students from all the campuses and advise these students which lead them to be overwhelmed.  The dean when I was there had a panic attack and had to go home one day. The expectation was work 7 days a week and be available 24/7.  The message from the president was that FTC is an online school and we need to service the students.  \n\nThe Executive Director was also forced to take on the job of admissions director. He lead the admissions team to fail and could not make enrollment in the 3 months I was there. The backbone of education was relayed upon with holding on to retain current students. Education made great numbers for the first two months but it was by any means necessary to keep the institution afloat.  This directive was disturbing to me as a experienced leader of academics. \n\nWhat was observed daily was no empathy for the students by directors, deans, president and the ED. There were times when students were experiencing major life issues like being in the hospital or having a death in their family only be hounded to post by online liaisons and directors.  Ill never forget one Incident where the dean and directors made jokes about having a student post in the hospital. The student just needed to post so FTC could make a retention goal. In reality the student would in hence fail and accumulate more debt. I did not find this in the best interest of the student. This practice was not ethical nor amusing. \n\nFTC best practices was that students were to hounded to post online If they are not being active for 4 days. No emphasis on academics or helping with life issues.  The directive was to give them some path stay a float by hook or crock. There were two paths pass or have them post.  Classes were also cut from 20 to only 18 days long so they could add to FTC\u2019s bottom line. This accelerated schedule was not in the best interest of a first time college student. Posting was empathized the most while passing them was the latter. \n\nIn regards to academic standards. There were many instances in my own online audits in canvas where instructors gave A grades even though there were rapid plagiarism and students didn\u2019t follow the rubrics.  Vice Presidents, directors and the Head Dean were aware and lended a blind eye to this practice because they do not want to loose students for retention purposes.  They encouraged instructors to pass them by any means.  This is against accreditation standards. \n\nI also did degree audits where  I found that there were added courses in general Ed\u2019s and electives that weren\u2019t needed for completion of FTC\u2019s AA and BA degrees in Criminal Justice, IT, Allied Health, MBC and Business.  These unneeded courses were added charges for the gain of the intuition and were un be known to the students. Students do not have any choices on which courses they take. It is all mapped out for them from the start. Students academic paths are preregistered. I did report this to the head dean and program director which they did nothing to correct it. This was really distressing to me to be ignored so I reported it to the FA Commissioner in Washington DC. It was unethical and wrong to these students who did not know and is huge title IV compliance violation.  Not right to add unnecessary time and debt to any student which are mostly are low income and first time college students.  \n\nIn a leadership role I spoke up in daily retention meetings and was told to stop in the pursuit on digging deeper into student issues. I was told that FTC was only interested if a student posted something. I was assured by the Head Dean that would have a another meeting weekly to dive into underlining life and academic issues  This never happened which blew my mind. \n\nThe main focus of everyone job here is to have to students post assignments or post to discussions so FTC could get funding. I would say out on a 10 hour day at least 6 hours of your work load is based on one daily retention meeting. This entails, running a daily retention report, having a two hour daily meeting, and trying to get a hold of students to encourage them to post something.  Another part of the job is making sure attendance is posted by instructors. There is no physical registrar to over see this. I never met the registrar or seen one in person. The registrar is on a ticket system which is completely ineffective and dangerous for compliance, scheduling and oversight. \n\nFor Training FTC boosts a leadership summit and town halls but it has nothing to do helping students or faulty. Honestly these meetings are required for training development but are a show so the president can feed his narcissism.  \n\nBecause of the issues above the faculty and staff are poorly trained. Again training and onboarding main emphasis is keeping the students by encouraging them to post. The head dean does online faculty meetings with the faculty but they are all about getting the students to post or to encourage them to pass by making exceptions. Nothing to do with enriching the students knowledge about subject matter. \n\nObviously I do not have a high opinion of FTC and would not recommend it to anyone to work there.  You will be a disposable number as a leader, director, staff, instructor and most importantly a student.  The goal is only the bottom line. The goal is not to enrich lives of students or nurture your career in education.  I  know this review is a huge risk to my own reputation but I\u2019ve taken this experience off my resume. It\u2019s an embarrassment in itself to be aligned to this school and will hurt your career in education.  I\u2019m sure FTC will tell you their numbers speak for themselves. With a 20% failure rate, poor retention, and 25,000 first year salary for students who grad with a 50,000 BA is despicable.
