Definitely recommend to freshman or sophomores looking to bolster their resume to apply to other internships. \r\n\r\nDuring the semester the work schedule is fairly flexible.

Good, supportive atmosphere open to answering questions. \r\n\r\nGood place to get some web development experience, front end and back end. They have a pretty decent onboarding process.\r\n\r\nAlso they would occasionally have a day of the week where for an hour and a half or so someone might present some information on some technology giving an overview of it and maybe going through some simple operations.

I got a little complacent and after graduation I think it hurt me some that I only had experience here in applying to other jobs. You can still work here during the semester for some extra cash at least at the time of this reviews posting. There is also the possibility that you may get stuck on working on some older projects that might not be the most stimulating. Again why I suggest not relying solely on getting experience here.\r\n\r\nI also applied for a full time position here several months after graduation. They were slow getting back to me although when they did they set up an in person interview fairly quickly. But afterwards they took a long time getting back to me with the results. I interviewed in late December and didn't hear anything until mid February. I sent follow up emails asking about the status of the position and never got a response. At least let me know that you are still deciding, going silent after an in person interview is not great in my opinion. It took prodding someone I know there to finally get a decision. Full disclosure I was rejected from the position. \r\n\r\nAlso the in position interview process was a little odd compared to the other places I've interviewed. If I recall correctly there were 5-6 people in the room when interviewing me. The most I've had at other places is 3. Though I knew a couple people in the room it was still a little intimidating.
