Its a priceless bonus that I am fully taking advantage of. Working with academics is a fantastic, rewarding experience, and having the space - and full support of management- to pursue further education and training is very welcomed, and definitely refreshing after my years spent in the private sector. Its a rare (and worthwhile) space to have your work based on quality, instead of profitability or extreme speed. You wont find a 3 time doctorate - especially one willing to help you improve your skills - in the average office, these people know what they're doing and you can learn so much just by being in the same room as them and working on projects together. I would definitely recommend finding a university position for anyone starting out in their career and who wants the support to improve their skills, continue training/education, and also gain mentors who are so beyond incredible and geniuses within their subjects. Its also a great space for work/life balance. The main goals are to learn, improve the world, and share knowledge, and I attribute these goals to the healthy/positive atmosphere and the type of people attracted to these positions. So far in my career within this environment I have had zero encounters with domineering people who are only interested in being in charge (which was a common occurrence for me in the business world), so it is easy to take your time off, work from home whenever, and just overall have a very healthy work/life balance without ever impacting your work or career. Working here has definitely made me appreciate work/life balance and healthier mental health, neither were freely given to me in the past but it is easy and quick to gain here. Not an environment for anyone who NEEDS to be told what to do, though, you need to know how to do the work and how to manage your own time and tasks. But if you can manage your work and time well, you can be very comfortable on the average day and have a great work/life balance. My entire time here I have worked from home, they are great about hybrid work and letting people decide how they work best. It creates teams that churn out projects quickly without working anyone to death, and I have yet to meet a stressed employee in my office (at least any employee who is not in management).", "cons": "Positions are usually based on grant money, so the salaries are on the lower end of industry averages and specific positions are rarely guaranteed for life, but you would never find this kind of flexibility, support, and education opportunities in the public sector. This is a great position for someone who wants to build their experience and prepare for the advanced years of their career, but I would not recommend it to someone who is there for the money and/or has no interest in quickly/vastly improving their skills or gaining experience with true industry experts. Also - to reiterate what I mentioned in the pros - this is not an environment for anyone who NEEDS to be told what to do, you definitely need to know how to do the work and how to manage your own time and tasks. But if you can manage your work and time well on your own, you can be very comfortable on the average day and have a great work/life balance."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business

wonderful-It's a big place so there are always bad apples; (c) lots of young people and energy; (d) generally supportive, warm, and might I add - loving environment... but remember letter b, part 2; (e) somewhat transparent with shared governance through the University Senate; (f) comfortable - ultimately, it's a State Government job, so people get comfortable and simply don't leave!", "cons": "(a) It's a State Government job, so people get comfortable and don't leave, when they should; (b) It's large with a culture of inefficiency which is frustrating for efficient, task-oriented, or ex-military people (c) professional pay must be negotiated up-front. (d)There is help, but you are generally on your own with your career path and your plan for professional growth - there are no paths or plans. I would argue that this is true everywhere, but see letter f in Pro's and letter a in Cons. (e) They struggle with diversity in senior positions.\r\n\r\nLet me explain letter (e): Although Dr. Wallace D. Loh - the past president was Chinese and the current president, Dr. Darryll J. Pines is black, the campus - like the rest of the United States, has Black folks and Hispanics working at entry level and service jobs - house keepers, food service workers, etc... and White folks at the top - Deans, Directors, Department Heads, etc. Diversity is an aspired value but Maryland is a historically and predominately white institution (PWI). However, they are very supportive of LGBTQ staff in senior levels... but this isn't helping Black America; not really. Even so, if you are generally qualified/credentialed and know how to \"play the game\" in America as a Black or Hispanic American, Maryland can still be a fulfilling place to work, and you may even get a senior position!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career
