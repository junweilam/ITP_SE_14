They state the hiring process is \u201cvery thorough,\" but with the lack of communication throughout that time it seemed more like they were dragging their feet. During the interview, the committee had trouble answering basic questions such as \"Who currently fills this position?\" and \"Who is the manager for this position?\" Later I learned that my manager was someone they had promoted in between my interview and job offer. The individual was promoted from an entry-level position and unfortunately and had no management experience or capability. \r\n\r\nIf you seek a career in higher education at a reputable and professional school, look elsewhere.
