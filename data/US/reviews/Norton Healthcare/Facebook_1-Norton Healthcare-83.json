You have to attend in person of will receive an attendance point. Pay is lower than competitors. Department is terribly understaffed, meaning you don\u2019t have an incentive to work full time, because you show up for your shift at $19/hour while the PRN EMT is making $30/hour doing the same job because they picked up the open shift last minute. Transport recently started taking patients back home including the dangerous parts of town 24 hours a day.

In light of a staffing shortage, all shifts needed to adjust their schedules and stay late frequently in order to complete their work. There was no incentive to the team to compensate for the additional workload, except for picking up an entire additional shift. Despite the increasing staff shortage, the shift pickup bonus was actually reduced. The company-issued appreciation gifts were near-unanimously ridiculed. Examples include a picnic blanket in late-fall, a bluetooth speaker, and socks.\r\n\r\nThough senior department leadership was approachable, it felt that they were not empowered to advocate for the pharmacy's greater needs within the company.

Small (sometimes seemingly petty) details related to policy often leaves employees feeling like voiceless replaceable machine parts.  And getting good surveys back often seems more important than fair patient treatment for all patients. For example: Patients with family present get better treatment and more attention out of fear that the family will send back bad surveys.  Employees are reprimanded more for not signing (legally insignificant) rounding sheets (for fear that family will see and be concerned) than they are for unsafe practices and shortcuts.  Having a voice about these issues is difficult in the environment because management is so little involved with staff and often lacking compassion for the struggle of staff related to staff shortages, old/unsafe supplies, etc.  Morale and often patient safety can be negatively impacted so that mgmt. meets some competitive goal with other managers from within their office.  So they just sit at their desks and bark new orders and policies often without obtaining staff insight or providing explanations.  The 'big bosses' only seem to show up on the unit when there is an inspection or a problem.    THEN the managers suddenly come out of their offices, and only to scare staff into being safer and faster than they have been expected (or even trained) to be before.  Then the entire staff becomes afraid and more voiceless than they were before.  I have witnessed many decent managers being regularly  fearful of losing their jobs.  I personally had 4-5 different bosses on the SAME UNIT (due to firing, quitting, and hiring) in my 6 years with Norton; imagine the fear and discomfort of subordinates with that sort of cycling leadership.  It is policy policy policy.  Survey survey survey.  And  fear of speaking up, because if you don't like it \"there's the door.\" ...and that is IF there is anybody that cares to listen.  If you speak up and the wrong person hears it, you get the feeling there is a target on your back.  So at Norton, the big themes of the culture are: either say something positive or don't speak at all, and do what you can without stepping on any toes with the staff and supplies the big boss (who is never present) allots you.  Very 1984 Big Brother is wacthing.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned culture of Norton leaves a person who came hoping to provide life-changing compassionate care for patients feeling like they are a cog in the wheel and wondering \"Is this it?  Is this all I can accomplish in healthcare?\"  There is a suffocating fear that looms in the air of units, leaving previously hopeful individuals choking on their suggestions for patient care.\r\n\r\n Also, having been a PCA and working my way up to RN, certain units at Norton treat their aides worse than any place I've ever seen (next to most nursing homes).  There is a ton of vertical abuse and the aides seem to have less voice than anyone.  It sometimes seems that there is no ceiling to the burden the hospital continues to place on these aides, leaving them feeling undervalued and defeated sooner than they've reached a year of service to the company.  This leads to aides constantly quitting these units, under-staffing, and resentment towards nurses from the aides that do stay.  In these situations communication and efficiency of the team is compromised."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Your manager will determine your experience at NH", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 May 2013", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "*Very good benefits\r\n* The opportunity to work with highly intelligent, capable people", "cons": "*They tend to hire a particular type of person - if you don't fit the mold or aren't willing to mold yourself accordingly, you will be \"encouraged\" to leave\r\n*Your experience will largely depend on who your manager is.

The whole time I was there, there was also an employee who created a hostile work environment with every employee in my dept.
