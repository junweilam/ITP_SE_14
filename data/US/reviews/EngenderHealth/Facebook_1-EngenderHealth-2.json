The organization engages exorbitantly priced consultants to presumably in part craft these insulting, deceptive reviews as they try to salvage what they can of the organization's tattered reputation. These reviews are clearly timed with the organization's MASSIVE recruitment effort, as it seeks to essentially re-hire an entirely new HQ staff. There are 21 positions currently being advertised (and so far less than 10 staff who will remain - mostly the folks who were already in the D.C. office, promoted themselves into Executive Roles, and/or otherwise glorified their own titles).\r\n\r\nNext, let's try to unpack why it is that they need an entirely new HQ.  It is still unclear what the move to Washington accomplishes. It has been said that it is to \"have a seat at the table\" - but EngenderHealth already HAD AN OFFICE IN WASHINGTON. And, what table?! The ousted CEO (Ulla Mueller) set these wheels in motion, and the Board/\"leadership\" had an opening when she was forced out to reverse course, or even to grow the Washington office organically through hiring as it reduced the size of the office in NY.  Yet, they went full steam ahead with the plan (without a plan). \r\n\r\nThe result: Only TWO NY-based staff (who were not Executive Team members or fully funded on a global project) accepted their offers to stay with this company. There is a reason for this, and it speaks volumes. (It is also how we know that the last two reviews are fake.) Also, contrary to what is said in Jan. 23 review about the \"Board compensating those who chose to move to D.C.\" what they are actually doing is reimbursing moving expenses up to a certain amount, which seems only fair given the completely radical change in the terms of employment. The sad truth is that employees who remain with EngenderHealth's new HQ is that they will actually be paid LESS than they are currently. The company has extended the official working day by one hour per day (meaning that employees will be expected to work five extra hours a week, a whopping 20 extra hours a month) - FOR THE EXACT SAME SALARY.  They have also barred telecommuting, one of the main \"benefits\" that have been touted in previous reviews over the years. Salaries for all new hires will be REDUCED by 8% over previous salary scales in the new Washington D.C. salary structure (something all job seekers should be cognizant of). \r\n\r\nThe irony and cynicism of an organization supposedly committed to  \u201cwomen and girls first\u201d while instituting such family unfriendly policies should not be lost on anyone. They talk about \"delivering on their central mission\" in their strategic plan (which is still being tinkered with) but can't even deliver on it at home."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Valuable organization with declining funding", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Program Manager in New York, NY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I really enjoyed my experience at EngenderHealth.
