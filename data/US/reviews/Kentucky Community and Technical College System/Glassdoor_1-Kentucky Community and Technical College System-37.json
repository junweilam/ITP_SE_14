Also, the campus I taught at was small, so it was a close-knit community and it was easy to get to know my colleagues and the staff.

Thus, KCTCS doesn't truly exhibit tolerance as, if you happen to be non-liberal and/or religious in your views, you will be put on the advancement back burner. \r\n\r\nThe same holds true for instructors who academically challenge their students. I had a few division chairs tell me to make my classes easier, to not hold them to the same standards as a four-year college would for a similar class. (I taught Humanities courses.) The reason? One was so I could pass more students (so the system valued quantity over quality) and the other was because the system viewed their students as academically inferior to their four-year counterparts. I never heard of such a thing, and it created difficult waters to navigate as I was asked to not lower my standards yet keep them low enough so all of my students passed, even the lazy/apathetic ones who exhibited little to no effort or work ethic.\r\n\r\nLastly, the system as a whole rarely gave raises (every five to seven years, at least as part of my experience) and they are minimal at best (normally around 1%).\r\n\r\nOverall, while I loved teaching and working with students here, I became disenchanted by the work environment and eventually resigned."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not a lot of room to grow here.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "1 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Maintenance in Louisville, KY", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Benefits and vacation.
