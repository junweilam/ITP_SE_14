Needless to say this is frustrating when your boss doesn't even know how to lead or direct. I tried on several occasions to make suggestions but they were ignored and disregarded. I was verbally disrespected and even called out of my name in front of staff and volunteers which brought me to tears on two occasions. Staff eventually became disrespectful of one another and volunteers as well. \r\nClients were constantly complaining about needing REAL help in obtaining work. Clients in the Professional Women's Group were given clothes every week just for showing up! Needless to say this results in the ladies just coming to go shopping for free every week.

As a result, my family suffered (I'm a single mom and on the bus line) and I had to halt furthering my education because I was failing so bad from missing classes and assignments. Educating, Enhancing, Encouraging, and Empowering huh?! The Manager of Workforce Development ended up quitting before I did. Good for her! Also, there is no room or opportunity of advancement. \r\n\r\nThe core of the business seems to revolve around funding and donors instead of serving the client. Only 12 hours a week max dedicated to serving clients. The remaining hours were for fund raising events and parties. Clothing and toy donations were taken to the Executive Director's church to be distributed! I know because I was made to carry the bags into the church. \r\n\r\nStaff was constantly in staff meetings with the Executive Director. As a result, work couldn't get done and  numerous phone calls from donors, clients, and agencies got missed. Complaints were made. \r\n\r\nEven though there were only 3 employees to pay, I barely made a living wage! According to Glassdoor,  the average Program Administrator makes 46, 000 a year.
