Narrow minded leadership is the reason nothing ever improves here. Also, everyone in executive leadership is related and nepotism was highly apparent across all departments. \r\n\r\nAngry students came in to the Career Services office daily because it was shared with the Student Services Director\u2019s office, which was often vacant. The career services team wore many hats and it was simply due to being located in this office. We were asked to take student ID photos, print and locate diplomas, and act as a reception desk. We constantly de-escalated students who were undertstandably upset that their transcripts weren\u2019t ready or that they showed up for a scheduled appointment to find an empty desk. \r\n\r\nExecutive leadership provided no direction, training, or recognition to the Career Services team despite us excelling at what we did. Directors in Financial Aid, Nursing, and Admissions verbally abused each other, their team, and other colleagues and were never held accountable for their behavior. Morale is incredibly low here.\r\n\r\nCovid precautions were handled terribly and there was no regard for the safety of employees or students. HR sits behind lock and key and there were never any communications sent out even after multiple Covid-19 infections had occurred."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Summit Career College", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in San Diego, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pros include benefits, schedule, great employees.", "cons": "Cons include appreciation for this place."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Mixed bag", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Sept 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Colton, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The current DOE is great to work for, have had some interesting ones in the past.
