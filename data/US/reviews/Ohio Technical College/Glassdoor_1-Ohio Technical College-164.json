They were within a few weeks of being closed down and only for the sake of a investor were they able to continue. Bad management, bed ownership.

Good ol boys club members only. IF jobs are posted, its extremely rare to get an interview. Extreme lack of resources. Training aids have reached their respective usefulness. are very outdated or in very horrible condition due to the lack of resources invested back into the programs. Employee division is epic. When the PowerSports School was moved to Cleveland from N. randall its demise has been imminent. Managers come and go. Students and staff are housed in an old steel facility.  Most of it appears to be storage? It doesnt really LOOK like a training facility.  No heat provided in the winter, so im told and have heard customers bringing in blankets while in class. Students state they feel isolated from main campus activities because staff will not come to their bldg because of the condition etc. employee reviews for performance are out the window. They just do not happen. Raises are poor. Always the lowest percentage possible. Never reflects cost of living etc... management is doing well tho. Nothing Ethical about OTC. It is a self serving entity that is consuming and profits without putting back into its programs. For profit organization. An excellent example."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great learning experience, but the school needs growth.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cleveland, OH", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Getting to know and watching the students grow.", "cons": "Frequent firing without reasoning.
