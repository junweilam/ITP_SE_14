Staff is so incompetent that upon my resignation they bungled my pay and benefits so badly that it took months of work to receive what they owed me. And they acted as if they were doing me a favor by paying me months later. I was once personally sued because the university didn't pay for a conference registration they sent me to. The place is a dumpster on fire rolling off of a cliff. Expect nothing but anguish and frustration at this place. Leadership is not transparent. The faculty tenure process is a mystery and highly political. There is no support or direction provided for this important process. It seems tenure is often denied or granted on a whim. Faculty are beaten down and disgruntled by the dysfunction and incompetence, but many have just accepted their fate. Others have left. Faculty turnover is high and typically replaced by lecturers or adjuncts. I waited for years thinking it would soon get better -- it never did. Only being at a new higher education institution that is well-managed and transparent can I see in hindsight what a poorly run disaster UNT Dallas was. It was as if they were making it all up as they went along. Resigning was the best decision I ever made."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "UNT Dallas", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Director in Dallas-Fort Worth", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Small institution so easy to get to know students", "cons": "Small institution so you may do everything without support"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "N/A", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Student Solutions Specialist in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great support system from faculty and staff.", "cons": "Work load increases around start of semester, which make sense, but I was always surprised by how busy things could get."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Nice Campus", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Project Coordinator in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good bunch of people!
