As a student who also worked part-time, I was amazed by the range of opportunities available to me. The professors were knowledgeable and supportive, and I always felt like I had the resources I needed to succeed. One thing that really stood out to me was how inclusive the campus community was. I felt like I belonged from the moment I stepped onto campus, and I made so many great friends through clubs and organizations. As a part-time worker, I also appreciated how flexible the university was with my schedule. Whether I needed to take a day off for an important exam or work extra hours during a slow period, my supervisors were always understanding and accommodating. Overall, I would highly recommend the University of Saint Joseph to anyone looking for a top-notch education and a supportive, welcoming community.
