President Mason is agile enough to be an effective president (read: politicking with fundraisers and avoiding making promises she cannot keep), yet warm and genuine enough to endear herself to most employees. She does seem to truly care about employees.", "cons": "The University, being in a small town, does have a tendency to hire within. While criticism for that is deserved, it happens because people from large cities often come in, hate the small size, and use a position here as a resume builder... and off they go, a year or five later, to a bigger city again. Sometimes this has its own frustrations...like spending all of your time replacing and training people,  which is why you can end up with internal promotions as often as not. However, I wouldn't discourage outsiders from applying; I would just advise that you make sure you have solid reason to want to live in Hays, KS. \r\n\r\n (Former) President Mirta Martin was divisive. You will see her referenced by others on here; she made history as the first female and first Hispanic president. At first, I was thrilled. She has an inspiring story, was a Cuban refugee as a child, etc. However, she became a tyrant. She literally *yelled* at faculty and staff in \"town hall\" type meetings, wherein she rolled out her suggestions for a broad \"re-engineering\" process. She brought in cronies from Virginia who were unqualified and underqualifed, and promoted them to VP and AVP positions, sometimes going so far as to create those positions for them. In one case, she even directed a search committee to rewrite a job posting, to fit a resume of a friend better.  So, yes, she was eventually forced to resign. And many don't understand why, because they bought what she was selling or because they weren't in those meetings.  She did do some great things while she was here (See the Hispanic College Institute), but her demeanor as a tyrant, her corruption at bringing in cronies who had no experience in the roles she placed them in, and her lack of boundaries and inappropriate ways of interacting with people (She hugged faculty and staff going into meetings- seriously, all of us, and we did NOT welcome these hugs), rubbing the shoulders of football players at games, and letting several of her fore-mentioned cronies live in the basement of the president's residence, infuriated many faculty and staff. Worse of all, she would have absolutely NO criticism, she would never listen to those who disagree with her. So, there really was no other choice.\r\n\r\nWhat this means today (Spring 2019) is that things are about a million times better, but there is still some healing going on. Fortunately, the new president (Tisa Mason) spent time at FHSU previously, as a VP.  This has provided for a smooth transition, so that she can focus on making things better and looking forward. She's been here for two years now, and things are much better. Best of all, it seems like the president actually cares about others' opinion. I don't agree with everything she does, but I generally can see why she is doing it, and I do still feel like my opinion is generally valued.\r\n\r\nHays is a small town- about 18,000 people. There are a few great restaurants and pubs (Look up Gella's/Lb Brewing), an active arts scene, and great rec programs for kids... but it's not going to compare to what you might have experienced, if you've lived in larger cities. The trade-off is that you might actually know the parents of your kids' friends."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great University to Work For", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Administrative Associate in Hays, KS", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They have a great benefits package, healthcare, insurance, etc. After 1 year of employment you are eligible for the 401K which I believe has an 8% match on a 6% contribution, and you become eligible for tuition assistance (50% for any classes you enroll in after becoming eligible for the benefit).\r\n\r\nThe job duties and responsibilities for an Administrative Associate or Assistant can vary from department to department.

I went though the training and thought it was more user friendly than its outdated predecessor software, but from what I gather from speaking to former colleagues a couple months later, they are still working out some bugs and it doesn't seem to be as user friendly as I suspected it would be. AA's use this software almost daily. I trust these bugs will get worked out over time and with continued use. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for many higher education institutions in Kansas, there as been issues with the most upper administration at the university. I will not get deep into the politics of the matter, but I will say I did not agree with how the former University President was removed from her position, or how some of the faculty and staff handled trying to remove her from that position. I don't believe that lack of professional behavior would be reflected in relationships between professors/administrators and support staff like AAs.
