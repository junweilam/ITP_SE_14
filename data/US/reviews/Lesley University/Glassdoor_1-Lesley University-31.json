Because of the high turnover, job creep is outrageous. People leave, their positions are \"frozen\" or eliminated, and then you get their work assigned to you in the \"interim\" but gradually it becomes an expectation of your job. When you try to get it added to your job description or get paid for it, HR ignores you or pretends they can't find your job description so all that extra work is yours. If you complain (which is hard because there is no official place to complain, not even HR), you're accused by management of not being a team player, because you won't allow yourself and others to be abused, and you are \"whining\" or \"over-reacting\" or \"creating drama\"--- classic abuse tactics. I hear this year we won't even get a cost of living increase, which is the equivalent of a pay cut. Also, there are three separate campuses and you have to take a shuttle between them (but it doesn't run in the summer). Because people are scattered, there is no sense of unity or communication between schools or campuses. The administration benefits by sowing division and maintaining these silos. Additionally, the university promotes diversity and inclusion, but it is just a marketing ploy. It's really only people with white savior complexes who don't and won't do any work on themselves. They are big on \"raising awareness\" through reading books and articles about marginalized groups without actually getting to know any of them, because they won't climb down from their white, cisgender academic towers. Lesley just wants to keep the lights on and recruit students. They will invest in them and in buildings, but they won't invest in faculty or staff, so students are just taught by bitter people struggling to survive. You should also know that this University has the worst reputation in the area among academics and others who work in higher education, except for Simmons University, which, ironically, is what Lesley is looking to imitate.  It's basically a slaughterhouse where you go if you can't work for a school that pays well like Tufts, BU, BC, Northeastern, MIT, etc. Even community colleges pay better than Lesley and have better benefits. Whatever you do, don't work here. Even if you think it's merely a transition to something better, temporary, or stepping stone. Don't do it. You will become so burnt out, broken-spirited, jaded, and mentally unhealthy that you will be a different person than when you arrived, a lesser person both at home and in your field, a shadow of your former self. Even if you've only been there a year. I've seen it happen over and over again. You are not the exception. Please don't do this to yourself. I'm only still here because my partner had a severe injury with multiple surgery and rehabilitation,  and we can't handle a lot change right now."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Career Resource Center Student Worker", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Apr 2018", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Cambridge, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, great on campus job where you dont just sit there and do your homework, you can actually put a great experience on your resume.
