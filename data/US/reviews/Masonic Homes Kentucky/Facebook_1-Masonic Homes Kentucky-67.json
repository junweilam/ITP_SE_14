My experience was, my supervisor NEVER listened to concerns I brought forth. I became concerned over my personal safety at a certain point and asked for that concern to be followed up on.,and was figuratively given a pat on the head and dismissed.\nUnfortunately, from my personal experience, no one cared that I expressed personal safety issues. In my opinion, the management may read these reviews and present a Glassdoor response to contact them directly so they can problem solve these reviews. Unfortunately , in my opinion, it is just a way for them to try and give the appearance they care, when In my own experience, I know better. In my opinion a new management team across the board is needed.
