I can also confirm what a previous reviewer said \"On several occasions, the CEO has bragged about how amazing the ministry is doing financially, but not to get your hopes up for any raises anytime soon\". I think there is the attitude that people will work for the ministry without zero regard for salary and that leads to bare minimum wages in many departments. While the ministry pays lip service to relationship/people focused management, (even having us watch videos by Dean Radtke about healthy management) many departments at the ministry still follow the usual Command and Control or Soldier styles of leadership that the Secular corporate world uses. They can't make up their mind if they wanna operate like a ministry or a corporation. They lean the ministry way when it's convenient to get people to not bring up complaints, but when it comes to how they handle people they're often colder than the corporate world. Usually the squeaky wheel gets the grease, in the departments I've worked in, the squeaky wheel get told to suck it up and get in line (in the name of Biblical submission) or leave. Leadership appears to ultimately makes decisions based on numbers and effecency with little regard to the impact it will have on staff. They're bleeding talent because of burnout and leadership is oblivious to what needs to be done to improve staff morale. Until they learn to truly value their staff, many departments will continue to hemorrhage people. Disclaimer: I don't put any of these issues on Andrew himself, I believe the issue is further down the chain of leadership. I also understand that not all the departments function this way but the two departments I have experience with both treated people as expendable."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent place to work and grow", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Intranet Manager in Woodland Park, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent workplace, leadership, and growth focused environment!
