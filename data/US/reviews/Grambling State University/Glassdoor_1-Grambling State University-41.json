If you can\u2019t get into your email, you can\u2019t reset it yourself, you have to reach an IT person. \r\n2. Basically an open enrollment school so students take a lot of time and effort. Teaching load is high. Advising load is impossible with the teaching load.\r\n3. Most administrators have never worked anywhere else so they are oblivious to best practices and have an inbred attitude\u2014this is how we do it at GSU.\r\n4. Administrators will lie to you to get you to work there\u2014then forget their promises. So if you must decide to work there, get everything correct and in writing before you start.\r\n5. Since they are willing to lie to get you there, they are certainly willing to be dishonest once you\u2019re there. \r\n6. Getting anything done is worse than pulling teeth. There is an exorbitant amount of red tape\u2014three or four people have to sign off in everything. The president even has to sign off on some travel expenses.\r\n7. Everything happens at the last minute\u2014everything!! They can send you an email and expect to you to receive the email (dubious with the email system) and expect you to attend a required meeting or training or submit a detailed document in less than 24 hours.\r\n8. No room for advancement because incompetent people are allowed to sit in positions for years\u2014some department chairs don\u2019t know how to use a computer\u2014in 2022!\r\n9. Medical benefits are also dubious. Electing and paying for a PPO is no guarantee that you will receive the coverage you pay for. Even though they make changes to the plans, you are only allowed to opt out once a year."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2022", "job_title": "Associate Vice President in Grambling, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employees are collaborative and supportive of one another", "cons": "We had too many dead lines"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Work Study Student in Grambling, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Worked with great athletic program gaining great experience", "cons": "Long hours and low pay"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "n/a", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Operations Manager in Grambling, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the benefits are very competitive", "cons": "the pay rate is horrible"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Awesome Place to Work!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Student Worker in Grambling, LA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Supported by staff and other students. \r\nCompensated travel. \r\nWorked on fun events. \r\nActively sought to enhance educational and professional growth.", "cons": "I do not have any.
