It is not a team atmosphere. It is very political and if you\u2019re an introvert, expect to get patients who are total care. Nurses who whine are rewarded and their assignments were changed. Their system rewards complainers, the people that constantly run to managers, but not people who keep their head down and simply want to go there to work.
