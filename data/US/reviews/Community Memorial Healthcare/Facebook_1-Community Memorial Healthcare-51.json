I once filled out a slip for my missed break and the following day the manager took the slip to my charge nurse and ripped it up in front of her stating, \"we don't use these here.\" She claimed that since some days you get a long break when it's slow it makes up for the busy days when you don't get a break so it cancels each other out and she refuses to pay for missed breaks.\r\nOne, that's completely illegal. Two, it was never slow in that department. Let's just say she quietly \"resigned\" after a multitude of incidents like this with all the employees.\r\nOther departments, such as Tele, ICU, L&D are great and you're paid every time your break is missed. Unfortunately we break ourselves and have no buddy system or break nurse due to hospital wide budgeting and policies so breaks are more often missed than received. \r\nThe hospital is extremely busy in every single department and staffing has been a huge issue. We are, majority of the time, over extending our nurse patient ratio in all departments.\r\nWhile building the new hospital, all budgeting has been strict so it's common for equipment to not get fixed appropriately or in a timely manner.\r\nAlso, they have been attempting to increase all our wages but even with the increases we still come in way under the bar, hence the lack of available staff. Majority of our staff is now new RNs. Also, they pay trainees significantly lower while training, I'm not sure how that is legal when one is liscensed, new or not, a state liscense is a state liscense. \r\nLots and lots and lots of redundant charting In ALL departments.
