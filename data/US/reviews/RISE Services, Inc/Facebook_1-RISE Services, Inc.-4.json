Whether or not it's \"right,\" Oregon law allows for employers to not give unpaid meal breaks if it would cause \"undue hardship\" to the employer. Every ID/DD services company I know has a waiver stating that letting caregivers leave for an unpaid break would be harmful to the people under care, and thus \"undue hardship.\" Now, I'm not a lawyer, so this might be inaccurate, but it's what I've been told repeatedly over the years working in the field.\r\n\r\nMy main point is -- yes, some of what happens at RISE, especially at the low levels, sucks.
