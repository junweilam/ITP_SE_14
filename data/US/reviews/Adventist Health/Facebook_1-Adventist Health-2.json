It used to be good, but just has so many hurdles to overcome, I just don't feel they will be successful in the future of healthcare. \n\nEmployees used to feel valued. This is slowly slipping away with increasing health plan premiums, unfair wages, and top heavy management. Employees also have very little resources when it comes to mobility. There is no clinical ladder, performance appraisals are a joke, and management write them based on the last two weeks of your work performance. The only way to move up is to be a relative of a member of management, or go to an Adventist church. \n\nThey have created a very disjointed system. They utilize two application systems for care: Cerner systems within the hospital, and Epic within the 40 clinics they run. They have also partnered with Cerner to manage employees of Adventist in some departments. This creates a very awkward message to employees as well as patients, because both companies just don't have a mission that aligns with one another. \n\nThey struggle with branding, and really entering a community they don't understand the demographic for. They currently only hold about 6% of the market for healthcare in the area. They just can't compete with the other large organizations who are well known for quality care. \n\nThey have recently undergone a transformation to move several entities of administration to the corporate office located in Roseville California. They are changing the mission, investing in new HRIS systems, and shifting several things to make the entire organization run as one entity, instead of separate hospitals. Hopefully this change goes well, however they are still riddled with hardship during this process due to the amount of upper management. For example why would an organization have 19 CFO's? Shouldn't there only be one... at the corporate office? Is there really a need for a Director, Manager, and Supervisors, over each department, at each hospital? Hopefully this will be looked into later, and the new corporate structure will realize and eliminate redundant positions and invest more on the positions that provide quality care and community outreach. Adventist Medical Center is just so slow to make any changes, by the time they do it may be too late. I would love to see another organization (possibly OHSU) come in and take over (not just partner) because the location really is convenient for patients and employees on the East side of Portland.

Besides the usual bullying of nursing culture, this is one of the worst hospitals to work for in the state of California.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve worked in other facilities prior to this and this is the only hospital where they are constantly short staffed. To be asked to work 16 hour shifts is the norm. They\u2019ll either ask you to stay an extra 4 hours or come in 4 hours early. It doesn\u2019t not matter whether or not you\u2019ve already worked your 3 days or in the middle of it, if you don\u2019t do it, you will be bullied.\r\n\r\nThe new grad program is horrible. The program is disorganized and the preceptors are unknowledgabe. My preceptor, who was a seasoned nurse, would ask other nurses including other new grads what to do when I asked her a question. Everyone is clueless.\r\n\r\nThe machines are outdated. Imagine having an RRT and calling a doctor who is already upset and has a strong accent, on a bad cell phone reception and your outdated spectra link is having it\u2019s own issues. \r\n\r\nComputers keep freezing up. Especially during a med pass. The tube systems can break down from time to time. So you have to run across campus to get blood as necessary. \r\n\r\nWe are one of the lowest paid facilities and it shows. Don\u2019t\u2019 believe me? Take a tour at one of our facilities. Don\u2019t let the star bucks and valley parking fool you. \r\n\r\nThere is no live interpreter. You have to use the phone, which I previously mentioned has issues, making communication almost impossible at times.\r\n\r\nArranging patient transport can be time consuming so typically nurses have to bring each of their patient down for CT, MRI, etc. \r\n\r\nYou will be floated. It does not matter if you are a medsurg nurse, an ICU nurse, whatever. All nurses are floated to high acquity departments such as ICU and ER. The worse part is, the ER float offers no orientation. You will be taking care of ACTUAL ER PATIENTS and no one will help you.
