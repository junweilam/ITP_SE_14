I was given the opportunity to learn a lot about the different aspects that go into donation -- the family approach process, the actual procurement of tissue, medical review and lastly the support provided to families post donation. It's definitely an invaluable experience and there is much to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother pro are people who work there. In any organization, some people are terrible/incompetent & some are amazing and way too qualified for what they're doing. I still have great relationships with colleagues I've met there, and I've seen so many develop and leave for better things. Plus, happy hours are always fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the stories we can tell! It's always funny (and maybe a little depressing) to tell family/friends about the crazy things that happen at OneLegacy. No I don't mean confidential donor stories, but the crazy things management will do and say to their employees. It's unbelievable sometimes! I think it's healthy to vent, laugh about how insane management is and appreciate that we will never have to live the type of life they have that caused them to treat others poorly (unless you stay of course... then sorry).", "cons": "Due to the nature of this industry, things are very fast-paced, which isn't necessarily a con because it does improve work ethic and really shows who is capable of adapting to such demands. However, this is added as a con mainly because of how OneLegacy deals with this fast-paced environment. They are vastly understaffed (this is also due to high turnover) and don't particularly reward or acknowledge staff who are high performers. \r\n\r\n\r\nWork life balance would be another con. I think it's a great organization for new graduates who want to make a decent paycheck (overtime is always nice too). However, the company does not encourage having a life outside of work, so it's really up to you to decide which is more important. Excessive work also leads to burning out staff, which isn't an issue for OneLegacy if their goal is to utilize staff at their high point. Great method for organizations that want high performers for a short period of time, with zero focus on development. I could see this being beneficial for certain roles at OneLegacy. \r\n\r\n\r\nTraining is an issue, but they have been moving towards a direction that focuses on this more. As I stated in my pro, it's an invaluable experience, but this \"experience\" wasn't given to me. Learning is something you have to do on your own. If you are genuinely interested in the industry, you have to take initiative to request to learn about other departments (I've heard of managers denying this, but I was lucky I guess). Also, a lot of what I learned was from Google searches. And oh Wiki is your friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement is probably the biggest con. Many are not qualified for their positions and were merely promoted because of favoritism. Great for the person promoted, but terrible for his/her direct reports. A majority of management is also unprofessional -- it's definitely unheard of of how much they could get away with without HR stepping in. It makes sense that they deal with so many legal battles. It's definitely a very hostile work environment, but a pro to this is learning what you want in a workplace and learning how to be a better person/manager yourself by doing the exact opposite of what they do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, I thought it was a good experience but it really depends on your priorities. I was willing to give up my life for these demands (mainly to boost my resume) and to earn a boat load of overtime cash. It's definitely not a place you want to stay at long term though -- really not healthy for your soul. I think we all die a little inside while working here, but think about how great it feels when you actually leave!"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Current Employee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "AMAZING Mission!

I was given the opportunity to learn a lot about the different aspects that go into donation -- the family approach process, the actual procurement of tissue, medical review and lastly the support provided to families post donation. It's definitely an invaluable experience and there is much to learn.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother pro are people who work there. In any organization, some people are terrible/incompetent & some are amazing and way too qualified for what they're doing. I still have great relationships with colleagues I've met there, and I've seen so many develop and leave for better things. Plus, happy hours are always fun!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the stories we can tell! It's always funny (and maybe a little depressing) to tell family/friends about the crazy things that happen at OneLegacy. No I don't mean confidential donor stories, but the crazy things management will do and say to their employees. It's unbelievable sometimes! I think it's healthy to vent, laugh about how insane management is and appreciate that we will never have to live the type of life they have that caused them to treat others poorly (unless you stay of course... then sorry).", "cons": "Due to the nature of this industry, things are very fast-paced, which isn't necessarily a con because it does improve work ethic and really shows who is capable of adapting to such demands. However, this is added as a con mainly because of how OneLegacy deals with this fast-paced environment. They are vastly understaffed (this is also due to high turnover) and don't particularly reward or acknowledge staff who are high performers. \r\n\r\n\r\nWork life balance would be another con. I think it's a great organization for new graduates who want to make a decent paycheck (overtime is always nice too). However, the company does not encourage having a life outside of work, so it's really up to you to decide which is more important. Excessive work also leads to burning out staff, which isn't an issue for OneLegacy if their goal is to utilize staff at their high point. Great method for organizations that want high performers for a short period of time, with zero focus on development. I could see this being beneficial for certain roles at OneLegacy. \r\n\r\n\r\nTraining is an issue, but they have been moving towards a direction that focuses on this more. As I stated in my pro, it's an invaluable experience, but this \"experience\" wasn't given to me. Learning is something you have to do on your own. If you are genuinely interested in the industry, you have to take initiative to request to learn about other departments (I've heard of managers denying this, but I was lucky I guess). Also, a lot of what I learned was from Google searches. And oh Wiki is your friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement is probably the biggest con. Many are not qualified for their positions and were merely promoted because of favoritism. Great for the person promoted, but terrible for his/her direct reports. A majority of management is also unprofessional -- it's definitely unheard of of how much they could get away with without HR stepping in. It makes sense that they deal with so many legal battles. It's definitely a very hostile work environment, but a pro to this is learning what you want in a workplace and learning how to be a better person/manager yourself by doing the exact opposite of what they do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end, I thought it was a good experience but it really depends on your priorities. I was willing to give up my life for these demands (mainly to boost my resume) and to earn a boat load of overtime cash. It's definitely not a place you want to stay at long term though -- really not healthy for your soul. I think we all die a little inside while working here, but think about how great it feels when you actually leave!"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Current Employee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "AMAZING Mission!

Questioning authority in these unfortunate circumstances will place a target on your back within the organization and you will be labeled \"difficult\".
