The organization does not value its employees and expects more and more work for free. The President is creating a climate of fear instead of collaborative teamwork. There have been no increases for inflation for at least 10 years let alone raises for performance or education and rank. Employees of Bethany College have lost a minimum of 25% buying power of the past years and it is probably closer to 40%. Cost of living has not been maintained let alone merit or additional raises. Salary is arbitrary and there is no traditional metrics that rewards education and rank as is customary in higher education. There are also NO opportunities to increase income based on additional workload. That is just expected. Morale is low and athletics are the life of this educational institution when academics and faculty should be the heart and soul! \n\nThe College is allowing anyone in the door that has a pulse.
