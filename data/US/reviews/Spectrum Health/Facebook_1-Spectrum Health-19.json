RN's aren't paid well, and once you're in the raises don't keep up with cost of living.  They gave all of the inpt RN's a pay raise a couple years ago because the \"magnet status\" people told corporate that they don't pay the RNs enough, but this raise didn't apply to anyone outside of the hospital group because magnet status is only for hospitals, so why pay the non-hospital staff more...?  So basically RN's who worked at the hospital for years & left because they were sick of being underpaid didn't get the raise they deserve.    Any job you apply to that should be a \"raise\" within spectrum bases that raise on your current rate, not on what the job should pay.  Basically for me, any job moving up the ladder would only give me a $1.30 raise- more of a slap in the face than anything.  Anyone looking to advance their career should do so elsewhere, then maybe come back to spectrum & they'll start you in at a higher rate based on that... otherwise they try to bleed you dry & spread you thin internally.  You're a dime a dozen, if you won't take the job for little pay, they will find someone to do it for that low amount.  Working here is basically a dead-end job.  They care more about how things are \"perceived\" by the patient that they do about the actual quality of the care that gets delivered.  If you gave corporate the option of \"doing the right thing for the patient vs doing something that makes the patient THINK they are getting the right thing\"... they would totally go for the latter.  Especially if it saves money.  They prey on the fact that a lot of nurses are caring types who martyr themselves and do a lot of \"cool\" \"Intense\" jobs for actual passion for their jobs or for bragging rights- but they don't compensate for the hard work RN's do\r\n\r\nSome individual managers are good, some are a joke.  Depends on the individuals.  The manager evals go from the top down, not at all from the bottom up.  There's no way to give feedback on your manager's performance... which shows that they only care about \"the numbers\" and how things are going on paper.  Meanwhile, the staff on the front line can actually identify a lot of waste and inefficiency in their manager but have no way to voice it without giving themselves away & putting themselves at risk for retaliation."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "low pay and low PTO hrs", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Patient Access Representative in Grand Rapids, MI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good People, great location, loved working with patients and staff", "cons": "Pay is very low and raises are far and few.
