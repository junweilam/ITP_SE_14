I don't know what it is about the culture that makes people that way. I don't think there's a lot of top-down affirmation and encouragement at some of the senior leadership levels of some departments. It feels like people are more motivated by the 'stick' than the 'carrot,' as a work culture, which is strange because individually people can be quite gracious, kind, and helpful. I never understood this dynamic and where it was coming from.  1% annual cost of living raise -- in a city that goes up at least 2-3% per year. The Board, which as usual for Boards, is comprised of mostly wealthy people, seemed out of touch with this reality. Flat organization. If you're not hired in at management, promotion not likely, or only to a nominal degree. But, that's all of higher education right now, for the most part -- not necessarily unique to here. If you're OK with that situation, this place could be a reasonable fit for you.
