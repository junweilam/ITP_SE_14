Staff members take advantage of the food pantry on campus because pay is not livable. Higher management thinks they are doing us well by coming into meetings to tell us how important we are to the university and how we are \"worth our weight in gold\" but then they shift the blame to us and ignore our requests to evaluate our pay scale. We are expected to do so much, processors process for almost every student, each department demands that they are prioritized, and make some of the worst pay in the office. Over worked with very little support and even less pay. (If you haven't caught on yet, the pay is not worth it) Higher management is absolutely clueless on what we do. Yet they come in with these grand ideas on how to \"fix\" things and act surprise when we tell them the obstacles we face in implementing them. The micromanaging along with them not knowing what the day to day responsibilities of our office makes the day-to-day stressful. Higher management doesn't listen to anything we have to say. Cross training and communication between departments is basically non-existing. That's why no one knows what we do. Staff finds out information about the university from news not from the university.
