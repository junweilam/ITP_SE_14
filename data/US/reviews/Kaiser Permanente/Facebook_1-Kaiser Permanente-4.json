If you are accustomed to working your way up the ladder, it's best to have some type of certification.  The company is MD-centric so the closer you are to the main focus of the corporation, the better your chances for respect, advancement, wages and raises.  \r\n\r\nKaiser has many union-based positions which offer some protections for people who do not have initials at the end of their name.  This helps maintain employment during times when the economy suffers and the company looks for ways to cut costs.  \r\n\r\nI have met countless people with 15, 20, 25 years at Kaiser.  It's not unusual - it's the norm.  Although starting salaries for many positions (clerical for example) may be low, employees tend to stay a long time and work up to higher salaries through their long tenure.", "cons": "I miss being performance managed.  When I'm judged based on performance, I have control of my reputation, career opportunities and future.  I am in a union position and most opportunities are based on your seniority.  Whether or not your input is taken seriously is based on seniority.  Whether or not  you have an opportunity to grow is based on seniority.  \r\n\r\nManagement gets away with dodging directly managing you by over-using the \"lead\" or \"senior\" positions.  This prevents you from knowing what is said about you and how the manager feels about you personally or about your performance.  If your \"lead\" likes/trusts/respects you, they will pass on a good report.  If they don't, it's human nature that they aren't interested in your success (and may want to get even) and will not pass on a good report.  You have little or no control of this.  Gossip is substituted for performance management here.\r\n\r\nAs with many companies, many job functions are being automated or out-sourced compared to 5-10 years ago, so if you don't have a clear medical specialty with an employment track record in that specialty, you are at risk.  \r\n\r\nIf you are older, you are safe if you are an MD or RN but if you are not in a designated specialty, age makes a difference in transfers and promotions.  \r\n\r\nIT employees who need to purchase supplies have to do so with their own money and then request reimbursement.  People who work from home likewise pay for connectivity and any related needs and then request reimbursement.  I have worked elsewhere when this was billed to a company credit card or directly to the company (e.g. internet connectivity) without relying on the pocketbook of the employee to finance company business. \r\n\r\nI have worked at companies with an open-door policy.

Have not been approved a 1 week vacation for  last 7 years. You get denied all vacations, and then you are told you cannot accrue anymore vacation if you have 500 hours banked. They say you must use up vacation days in order to accrue more if you have 500 hours banked, but they deny all vacation requests. you can take off a wed here and a Thursday there, but denied all 1 consecutive weeks off. They do not utilize Per Diem staff to approve vacations. You request your vacations once a year by seniority. So if you want to plan a trip to Hawaii or similar, you are denied because more senor people take all vacation days. Union contract states they must back fill in order to let employees use accrued vacations, but Unions do  not enforce their contract and they refuse all grievances, (seiu) \r\nthey claim they strive to be best employer, but without a vacation in 7 years, i don't see that happening.\r\nThey advertise being a union. The union, seiu, isn't  the normal type of union. they are really called a union management partnership. Partnership with management does not define a union. Since this partnership, things went down hill.\r\nBeing part of a union greatly increases wages, but it also keeps employees who do not do their fair share of work load. example: i may do 41 patients per day, while others do 3-10 per day. I don't care if others work, but watching patients wait for 2-3 hours to get lab work or other service is heartbreaking. They are only waiting for hours  because management doesn't enforce employees to work, or they don't cover employees who are out on vacation or leave.\r\nThis place is unethical with their harassing and bullying. If you sustain a work injury, they will harass you until you quit. Their human resources department are the worst harassers and they discriminate. Upper management only increases these behaviors if you report  their actions.\r\nMy department did a restructure, and they eliminated all evening shifts, having employees come in 1 hour earlier. Even though you still work evening shift ( ending after 6pm), you are considered day shift in order to not receive differential. I don't care about the money, Just want to be on evening shift in order to obtain a vacation. Currently, evening shift ration of people allowed off is approx 1 off per 6 employees. If you work day shift, ration is 2 off per 25 employees. At the least, make the ratios comparable. Day shift should allow at least 4 off if comparable to evening shift.\r\nLastly, If you are a union rep, it seems all disciplines are omitted. Unfortunately, this is why most reps volunteer. They know they will not be disciplined or other if they are a union rep. Alot of the reps who volunteer are also the employees who do not do their fair share of work (lazy) and simply want any excuse to get out of work for numerous meetings and such.These reps do not care about helping anyone, and they only vote and implement in areas that benefit themselves. Currently, all reps say they will file a grievance, but  never do. Look it up online and see all the grievances unresolved from seiu. The list doesn't include all the names of employees that were told they have a grievance in process , but really do not."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great for pharmacists, not so much for interns.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Pharmacy Intern in Denver, CO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pharmacists and techs\r\neveryone is knowledgeable\r\nNot tooo much drama\r\nGreat environment on days when you're consulting and filling\r\nLots of diversity\r\nWell staffed", "cons": "Driving 1.5 hours for a 4 hour shift can get old, especially when they don't pay for commuting or gas mileage.\r\nOther companies pay 50% more and have closer locations\r\nLots of shifts where you're up front all day as a clerk (40%)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "My last year at Kaiser was actually 2008, hired in 2002 as a Teleservice Representative\"", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Mar 2016", "job_title": "Teleservice Representative in San Jose, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Offtop the UNION is the best of all unions ive heard of or experienced.

No outline is given on how career growth will be facilitated and there are very poor resources in personal development within the company, specifically related to programming. The biggest downside for KP, specifically for the Medical Office Controller department in the Greater Sacramento region is its lack of leadership direction in the healthcare technology space. This stems primarily from a lack of initiative and understanding on what innovations and work needs to be done in the healthcare industry to bring healthcare technology into the modern era. Furthermore, there is no direct line of communication between technology experts and leadership in making progress with the healthcare technology landscape. This leads to missed opportunities in providing better healthcare for patients and a better job environment for doctors and nurses alike, along with lowering team morale because frustrations are kept hidden instead of speaking about them publicly. The culture is corporate so any real change that you want to make will have to go through several blessings, and this becomes more challenging especially if leadership doesn't sponsor the initiative. One of the challenges(a good one to have), is to educate leadership on these initiatives, but there is still a disconnect from leadership understanding the bigger picture on how certain technologies, such as machine learning, version control etc, will help improve overall workflow. Open source technologies are often mistrusted around the organization because of the worry of security issues, so workers resort to older technology to get work done, which often times are more inefficient. Pay is also not comparable to other companies that do similar data or programming work, and there is really no push in keeping talent within the company. \"Keeping the lights on\" is a motto with the department, which is just fancy terminology that workers should focus on basic work, rather than innovations that would have positive long term effects. Innovation is encouraged verbally, but not through leadership actions because often times those same exact innovations (introduce version control to teams) are not sponsored effectively. This leads to delays in teams implementing basic technology workflows within the team. Politics are played within departments, that gets in the way of actual work and also leads to delays of innovation."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Don't underestimate the value of communication and leadership.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Oct 2008", "job_title": "Managerial Consultant in Oakland, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great health benefits, generous time off accrual, generous matching for 401k", "cons": "Mid level managers more concerned about protecting their backs than providing leadership and guidance for their staffs."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "27 Jul 2010", "job_title": "Project Manager II in Oakland, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Perfect place for a work life balance.\r\nGreat opportunities to move internally and grow.\r\nOne of the best benefits package\r\nDepending on the group, you may have flexibility to work from home as well for limited number of days.", "cons": "Too many processes since it is a large enterprise.\r\nHealth care is the core business and not IT.

You do many hours of extra patient emails, prescription renewals, and phone calls. The support staff is largely medical assistants.  Kaiser doesn't like to invest a lot in mid-level providers like RNs who could make our job easier.    Why? because the physicians are salaried--it's cheaper for MD's to do this in the evening and weekends on their own time than provide professional-level support.  You have to close charts, answer calls and emails within one day.  You also have to work evening clinics and weekend clinics.  They are slow to replace MDs who leave and this adds to the burden of coverage.   As a result the work-life balance is poor.   \r\n\r\nYou can feel like an overpaid data-entry clerk and customer service representative.  You will be given talks about \"providing excellent customer service.\"   It's hard to feel like a physician.\r\n\r\nI have several ethical concerns regarding how the company inserts itself in the doctor-patient interaction.  The patients rate you and these ratings are partly used to decide whether you can stay in the Medical Group.  [My ratings are actually on par with my group so this isn't just sour grapes].   Making sure the patients are \"satisfied\" promotes overprescription of antibiotics, narcotics and sedatives.  Doctors need to be able to say \"no\" and have difficult conversations that aren't \"satisfying\".   And, because Kaiser is an insurance company,  patients occasionally worry we are \"trying to save money\" on their care.  An example, if you make more specialist referrals than your colleagues, you will get \"dinged.\"  \r\n\r\nSpecialists more likely to give a quick phone opinion and are less inclined to \"own\" patients and follow them for their chronic problem than in private practice.   \r\n\r\nThere is a corporate culture of \"Kaiser Kool-Aid\" about how great the system is.  Smart doctors with ideas  for improvement and contrary opinions are ignored because they don't reflect the unrealistically rosy view of management about the Kaiser system and our work lives.  \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of physician jobs.

They are pretty technical people but really have no sense of what it takes to be managers.  They hang together and they whisper and pass information back and forth among themselves. They definitely know their pecking orders.  If an Indian IT Director says jump the Sr. Indian Managers would say how high and then in turn he tells his reporting Indian manager to jump x number of feet and he would in turn tell the rank and file engineers to jump x number of feet.  They follow their superior's orders blindly and expects their subordinates to do the same.  They are very results conscious.  That means you are expected to do 60 hour work weeks for months at a time with no time off (and your comp times you are expected to carry your cell phones) to complete your tasks.  \r\n\r\nThese are not managers with \"your\" career goals in their best interest.  They are concern with looking good in front of their customers/stakeholders so they too can become Directors and Sr managers.  Mangers will say one thing to you and turn around say something else to the stakeholders to make themselves look good.  If you are on the team and make a mistake with the stakeholders there is no way they will step up to protect you the employee.   They will literally hang you out to dry just to ensure your mistake does not make them look bad and stall their career advancement.  These managers are very political and they are very good at playing the political game and they know what it takes to ensure you don't make them look bad.  \r\n\r\nProbably not all of KPIT is like this but in this IT department in Pleasanton that was what I observed and experienced for 2 years.  If you get an offer with KPIT in Pleasanton I would highly recommend speaking with the sw engineers and support engineers to understand what the working environment is all about.  Once a week you are expected to work a 12 hour shift doing support (they don't ever tell you this during your interview.

I have worked in both administration and clinic sides. I have dedicated much of my life to this company, I have sacrificed so much... including my health. My turning point was when a corrupt employee/ Chief steward and manager decided to try and fire me for my absences due to medical reasons. I have a debilitating medical illness that requires me to take off periodically. Kaiser is so staunch with the vacation and sick hours you've earned, that if you exhaust those because of any leave, you are immediately put in a spot and management will keep every tab and eyes on you. Leaves I was out on: medical: major surgery for my health (3 mos, 2012) medical: still birth; grieving (3 mos plus therapy; 2014) medical: work place injury (mental, 3 weeks, 2016). \r\nI am currently on leave, and have been thinking of resignation. The first leave was my own medical condition, but I had struggled to get my benefits settled and was constantly harassed by management for my time off. Second... I had experienced great stress from same manager plus another manager that I was hospitalized and I lost my baby due to preeclampsia. Third... stress at work, there are extenuating circumstances which I am not allowed to discussed, however when I first started this new position,  the new manager had told an employee from another department that \"I better watch my lateness\". This is very unprofessional and uncouth. I ended up being ostracized for this as she has forced me to withdraw from people because of rumors she had spread. I reported to upper management for 3 months as I was so upset that I refused to go to work unless I reported to someone else. Furthermore, I had asked for adjustments to my work station,  constantly because of my operation prior, and because I'm a Disabled person by CA state law. Though I repeatedly said this, management refused a desk high enough for me and a chair due to \"keeping costs down\"the solution was to send THEIR ergonomic specialist to evaluate me, after repeatedly telling said person my needs due to my disabilities, i finally got the approval for a higher desk. Her first suggestion (and managers suggestion) was to stack reams of paper under my monitor to raise the height. Still to this day, I have no compatible desk and have 3 reams of paper under my monitor. No changes were made despite the approval of the ergonomist. I am right now being falsely accused and have had council with several upper management. They send a compliance representative to prove that You are guilty. I was shown a piece of paper with people called and was said that I didn't comply. This is all heresay, and even if I never did anything; unless I take this to court, I won't be able to save my job. This is a week after I was found on the floor of my office, face down and unresponsive. I've rescinded to getting out of this toxic environment, as no job is worth my health. \r\n\r\nThe union has many rats and protects their most valuable people, however, if you are not of any value to them, they will do nothing to help. I was a steward and ended up being told on by a chief steward and was sent to talk to compliance about timecard fraud. I proved her wrong, and 2 employees/ union reps vouched for me. \r\n\r\nI told the area specialist about this, and he knew what was going on. No one voted her out and no one said anything when I quit."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Pharmacy technician properly filled and dispensed an average 200 prescriptions per  day", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Pharmacy Assistant in Van Nuys, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They have very good opportunities for everyone one and be part of the team to continue helping the community and those who really needed.", "cons": "To be successful in life and ,help others with love , and patience .

Inefficiencies administrated by management plague many day-to-day operations who reward themselves with multi-million dollar per year salaries and numerous pension plans for themselves while simultaneously raising member's premiums significantly and working to eliminate the one employee pension plan and limiting annual raises of workers to less than yearly inflation.  Administration began a yearly program in which they waste millions of dollars by sending EVERY EMPLOYEE (every year) to a 'service forum'  with the stated purpose of encouraging better service to healthcare members while simultaneously short-staffing every department for several days which increases patient wait times and reduces services and/or requires departments to cancel members appointments.  Following the service form, management issues corrective actions against workers for attempting to provide better service per the recommended service forum recommendations (i.e. walking patients to their scheduled appointments, conversing with patients in order to provide a more friendly healthcare environment, etc.) because this sometimes takes away time from the workers' other duties causing them to not finish work and/or work overtime.  Basically, administrations SAYS they promote a positive, rewarding environment but they DO nothing to back their words up.  \r\n\r\nBut, it's not all management's fault; many employees have worked for this company for a lengthy period of time because of the decent wage and benefits, but morale is poor (in part due to management's attacks on meaningful wage increases and efforts to eliminate pensions, etc) but also because these workers are simply bored.  These are repetitive jobs which many have performed for many years but because they are comfortable with the pay, many do not continue with school or other, constructive activities.  Instead, employee-on-employee fighting is frequent (i.e. workers creating a poor work environment for each other by trying to get each other 'in trouble').

They almost sank the whole system over their rush to take over the prestigious Electronic Health Record positions that they didn't understand. On the \"business side\" looking the part came to mean more than technical knowledge: in fact \"technical people\" were regarded as contingent labor to be used and thrown away. \r\n\r\nWhile I worked as a mere project coordinator, the insight I got into the highest level workings of Kaiser was enough to make me never want to work for that company again. I was hired after a year of working as a temp. The first thing my new manager did was try to elicit dirt on another manager I had been assigned to. When I demurred, she tried to bring up the subject in other ways. Finally she dragged me into a meeting with the Director of the department and told him that she thought I was afraid to talk about the problems with this former manager, whom she was apparently trying to set up to be fired. \r\n\r\nWhen I still refused to cooperate, she started to make a big show of building a file AGAINST ME. When I had technical problems with my computer and sent an email notice that I had to miss a staff meeting because I was with tech support, she sent an email documenting how she had explained to me that it was a job requirement that I attend staff meetings. Then she asked for me to give her a list of everything I liked and disliked about my job *IN WRITING*. She continued to disguise her actions against me by sending me to get a new ergonomic chair for my desk. But the very next day after that, she called me into her office to fire me: it turned out she could fire me for no reason at all since I was still in my probation period.\r\n\r\nI did attempt to complain to Human Resources, but apparently she had already been calling them for weeks, and they had been arming her for how to legally terminate an employee, whether there was cause or not! I then went through the months long process of appeals. This turned out to amount to asking the manager whether she would consider taking me back. My appeal was rejected the day before Christmas.\r\n\r\nIt outrages me that a manager in a large, respected company like Kaiser, in such a high level department, could get away with this sort of scheming, manipulative behavior - and then just fire anyone who doesn't cooperate with her. As far as I know she has continued to rise in the ranks, while I was thrown out on the street.\r\n\r\nAs for the general level incompetence - I saw that all over the office. But the most appalling thing was the Indian programmers. I don't say that to be racist: India has great technical education, and the programmers that went through that education system deserve a lot of respect. But the guys I'm talking about were hired simply because they were Indian and they *looked* like programmers! They were calling their buddies for how to do their job all the time! Worse, they were calling me! I was more technical than they were, and I was being paid clerical wages while they were being paid over $100k a year and getting to go to conferences! There is something wrong with the way hiring managers stereotype people in this country. Working at Kaiser really made me cynical because I had to see that there are a lot of people who lie on their resumes, and have a whole system set up to lie on their recommendations, and they end up in great jobs. And then there are honest people like me who know things because they read a lot, but they have no one to vouch for them, and they make chicken-scratch because they are nerds who don't network. In a way I'm glad I didn't work at Kaiser long, because that environment would have made me bitter about life."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "My experience was very good at Kaiser.

The HR organization appears to have been co-opted by union/diversity agenda people who help contribute to the equal opportunity, egalitarian, let mediocrity reign/\"let's hire the least qualified/cheapest person we can possibly find who might have a prayer of holding down this job\" heck hole of a work gulag full of demotivating incompetents that is KP."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Very clique-y along with a High School mentality, and rampant with favoritism.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Sept 2014", "job_title": "Senior Health Information Management Assistant in Baltimore, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Pay.

However I should have taken heed to the negative reviews from former employees as well as the legal trouble Kaiser is ALWAYS in. Kaiser is always being sued by either a patient or a former employee. I was terminated during my probation period over hearsay. \r\n\r\nThe 70-something days I was there, I only saw my supervisor TWICE for maybe a few hours. Yet she claimed she received all these complaints about my attitude and my work attire: she claimed someone said I was wearing jeans and a mini-skirt. Yes...a mini-skirt. And she was so convinced that this was true, despite only being at my work location twice. How would she know if I violated dress code if she was almost NEVER there? I had never heard a word about anything I was doing wrong until the day I was fired. Nothing.\r\n\r\nNow to my coworkers: lazy. I was left to my own devices many times due to my coworker either picking up her car at 3pm (not allowed, by the way), and holding long conversations with her husband or other employees while patients are waiting to be served. Day after day, I was handling the window and the phones on my own because my coworker didn't feel like working. Yet no one complained about that. Not to mention, on one occasion, we \"lost\" a patient's school form. My coworker did not document where she left the form and the patient made a complaint to my department manager. After some research, we found it upstairs in another department (as the patient was coming in over the weekend for some other business). My department manager actually blamed the front desk clerk in the OTHER department for not giving the form to the patient....and NOT my coworker, who failed to document where she put the form in the first place. That should have been my first red flag, because documentation is EVERYTHING in a Medical Records department.\r\n\r\nI did file a complaint about HIPAA violations to OCR. Maybe that had something to do with my termination. But hearsay does not hold up in any court, INCLUDING unemployment. Which of course I won because Kaiser could not produce any evidence of my wrongdoing. The shock and the pain of being fired has worn off, because I hold myself to a high standard, and I do not operate well in a high-school work environment that is rampant with favoritism. Despite losing my income(which was GREAT) I am glad to be gone."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Prescription for Insanity", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "26 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Pharmacy Technician/Pharmacy Assistant in Harbor City, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The best thing about the company is the pay and the benefits.

Almost 13 years with this company and minimal opportunities to have consistency with scheduling.This company is losing it's values. It reminds me of how a little hole in the wall burger place had the best tasting, best quality, affordable authentic menu until they expanded. Before, the staff of the smaller establishment was like a family, they took care of each other. As the company grew they lost site of what made them great in the first place. The food became ordinary and sloppy  and the new workforce got treated like an expendable piece of trash. Kaiser refuses to take responsibility for it's upper management. The management has become like a mafia out to play God over your life. They are ego maniacs and cruel people.They have been given so much rope that they know they can harrass you, bully you, discriminate against you,  and get away with it and if you don't grovel for their mercy, they can take an honest living away from you and your family. As I type this review I'm getting knots in my stomach, it is that disheartening. This is a healthcare organization that will reprimand you for being unhealthy or having health challenges. Many people may be saying, \"that's what the union is for\" and I reply, \"what union\"? Let's be clear, you can't work for this company in some departments without be apart of the \"union\". Well my experience with  the union has not been positive. Your union rep. will be the 1 and only union rep for about 31 different sites. So just think, your 1 location may have 30 employees alone represented by this  rep. whom I must say is human and grows weary. Sometimes you might find yourself in some turmoil with management and need urgency only to find that the problem  had enough time to snooze with no assitance from labor to make you just give up on the issue for the moment. Unfortunately, you will feel desperate enough to reach out to your rep. again because once there is a discrepancy with management, that my friend is how you land yourself on the hit list. You will be scheduled the most undesireable job duties, if you don't have a set schedule you will be dished the most undesireable schedule,and things that can slide with other employees you will be written up for. You can go from having level  0 write-ups to having level 4 in a matter of months which means you are almost unemployed. They claim to have a lot of things in place to deter and report this type of behavior such as compliance, no retaliation policies and HR but it is all an illusion too. HR will always favor management, compliance will want some type of identifying information so you can really be retaliated against although supposedly you can report things annonymously, and retaliation can be masked by management with things like their discretion and the needs of the department.  The nepotism may be a contributing factor as well. You may go to your manager's supervisor as the chain of command states to with an issue only to find out they were room mates in college, or they were neighbors somewhere. You will carry a stress that is beyond belief unless you can  become apart of the favorite clique. Yes, I said clique as in high school, mean girls club; that kind of thing at work. If you don't you'll find yourself in a living hell. None of your stress will be simply from what you were hired to do.

The offices in Pleasanton were beautiful and the only consolation for the cons you see before was an office with a door and white boards etc. . . !  but my coworker --even though there were lots of empty offices---decided to pair me with someone even though I needed to concentrate at times. I think he had been against hiring me and he set out to prove he was right. He proved it. Sorry I am supposed to be positive. If you are used to high tech, you will be astounded at how you have to get into the 'who will clean the coffee pot\" today--which ends up being something the women do.", "cons": "They offered me a position they said was a contract to hire type job. I left a great contracting position because what they offered was closer to home and I was juggling a special school situation with my child--which I was not allowed to let them in on as I was with a head hunter agency. Another weird issue --you had all these insane rules about contacting the manager about anything relating to your work situation. . . and you couldn't email out. It was RIDICULOUS. . I was supposed to be at a location with a great commute to my home, but they said I'd have to be at a location another hour a way \"for a while.\" Despite this change and the fact that I'd quit the other contract to get this, they offered no flexibility in the new place, and the same starting time,  and scoffed at my complaints about the traffic on 680 when I would get there late--unavoidable as I had taken the job being told it was the close location around the corner from his school but the other was a 25 mile commute down crazy 680 and 580 in the worst rush hour times. And I couldn't drop him off early. No that part is not their fault I had to deal with my son's school drop off (special school so no bus possibilities)  but it IS their fault that the job I agreed to was in place one and they moved it to place two but refused to change the start time or accommodate the craziness even temporarily while I worked it out or found someone who could get him dropped off. EVEN THOUGH I could have done the whole job as a telecommute or some of it--only one team member was even there! To make a long story short, I was trapped. I couldn't get them to move the time it started to avoid traffic or to accommodate dropping off my son off at a better time, or even to give me the time to arrange some other situation for him. But still they insisted I start at exactly 8:30 in the midst of a terrible traffic situation, and leave at 5:00 even though, again, my management was never there, the people I served were remote, and there was only one other coworker ---who hid in his office down the hall all day. So they basically changed a 15 minute twice a day commute into a 2 hour twice a day commute and as I said scoffed at my begging them to let me work in the other location,  and scoffed that traffic could be that bad (the manager who scoffed lived in another state and did not believe my reports that traffic had doubled from 2009 to 2013. But it had. ANyhow that was bad enough. The rest was they changed the nature of the work they wanted me to do and again, I had left another job  to get this new type of work for me.  The kicker was that while I was there they decided not to hire  any IT people from Northern California. So the contract to hire I had been enduring all this for --the prize at the end of the rainbow- was bogus. Then, they let ME go with no warning no severance of course, no chance to explain what I had accomplished (including training an intern) and no apologies. It was one of the worst jobs of my life, and it set my career back several years as I could have stayed at the previous contract at a wonderful company but had left for the chance of a perm job.

I interned in the System Solutions and Deployment department, which was described to me during my interview as a business support/development role for the electronic medical record system. In practice I spent the majority of my time at work sitting idle in my cubicle. When I had actual work to do, which was rarely, I was fixing billing errors. Going into my internship with KP I had two previous internships and four years of college (At a top-10 school) under my belt,. I was unable to use any of my previous experience or degree to help me, and instead spent most of my days copy+pasting data and clicking buttons in HealthConnect. I was not given access into the system until the fifth week of my ten week internship. During the first five weeks of my internship I sat at my desk and entertained myself on my work computer, doing nothing. When I finally got system access, I did about six days of button clicking and copy pasting in the remainder of my internship, and the rest of my time was spent surfing the web and sitting idle in my cube. \r\n\r\nI spoke with one of the higher ups in my department on my second to last day and walked him through my internship experience with KP. He was extremely disappointed in what went on, and said that things should not have happened that way. There were multiple times things could have been turned around for me and the other interns on my team, but they just weren't. Everyone on our team knew we were sitting around doing nothing, and our team lead knew as well. I also went over my qualifications and what went on in my interview, and he was unable to say why I was assigned to this department. (All the administrative interns are interviewed and then sent to a department that matches their qualifications). I learned from a coworker after speaking with this higher up that the intern coordinator was looking at other jobs and was very apathetic about the internship program this year. \r\n\r\nWhen all was said and done, I showed up at Kaiser Permanente ready to work. I turned down another job offer to work here and traveled all the way across the country to take this job because I thought it would be the best job for me. I had all my ducks in a row, but was placed in a department that was a very poor fit for me and ended up having a poor experience with KP. I don't think I will apply for a full time position after I graduate. \r\n\r\nOther Gripes: \r\n\r\nMy work computer was not powerful enough to sort some lists I was sent and expected to sort in Excel. \r\n\r\nIf you need anything done, you often have to call the HR service desk and spend a significant amount of time on hold.
