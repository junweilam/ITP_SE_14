In my experience salaries are above market for most positions, and the benefits are so good that many people become \"lifers\". The health coverage is extremely generous, and time off starts off adequate and gets better over time (18 days when you start, moving up to 33 after 15+ years - this does not include sick time). Employees truly believe in the mission of KP (at least, I do) and it's clear that this is a place where employees' contributions are valued. Although my role is not part of any of the unions, the fact that our workforce is predominantly unionized also places a positive role in KP's reputation as a good place for workers (although having unionized staff also presents many challenges). Overall, I enjoy working at KP and would recommend it to others, but understand that you are entering a big bureaucracy. A friendly, mission-driven bureaucracy, but still.", "cons": "Cons: having lots of \"lifers\" means that innovative ideas and workflows are not always adopted without a fight. People have their roles deeply embedded here, and any threat to the status quo is seen as negative, even though we need to make some pretty radical changes given the new health care environment post-ACA.  There's a lot of \"not my job\" attitudes here. It's hard to navigate the layers of bureaucracy, both in terms of personnel/HR/benefits, and in getting work done (there are often 4-5 departments at the regional and national KP levels working on similar areas, and no guidance on who does what.)  Be aware that KP is not immune to reorganizations and layoffs -- they do make a good attempt to ensure workers are hired elsewhere in the organization, but there are no guarantees, and there can be a lot of turnover in certain departments.\r\n\r\nBenefits are currently generous but are always subject to downgrades in the future, so just be aware of that. Some changes to the pension and retiree medical benefits are about to hit, and with them a wave of Baby Boomers will be taking retirement, which should hopefully open up many new management opportunities for Millennials. \r\n\r\nOh, and the biggest con of all: we still - STILL - use Lotus Notes for email.

I worked for Kaiser Permanente for 13 years. I was proud being a Kaiser Permanente employee before, and this was when I was in my late 20s to 30s. Kaiser was great then as I was a single woman, and starting to build my career. After three kids, and two Workers Comp's case for my work permanent injury, Kaiser was not so worth it anymore. Management blamed everything on me, as we all know we always under staffed and very difficult to find help to reposition patients. Colleagues and charge nurses would help, but they wouldn't like me so much afterwards. I often heard that colleagues would talked about other colleagues in a negative way. Not to make the situation worse, I was transferred to another department after my leave of absence, and the Department Administrator accused me of a lot of things that I did not do such as \"missing for hours\" while in fact I was sent to Flu Clinic by the Charge Nurse to help out. and what a good leader should do, was investigate and verify right? no, she went straight to write a corrective action and pushed me to sign it. Like what others had mentioned, the Union was a joke. I never asked for help other than when this happened, and they replied that I just came back from a leave and I needed to prove myself. Again, it just felt that I was nobody, I was just a robot doing whatever they asked the staff to do/ fill out, and that my critical thinking was not appreciated. Pretty much, just be quiet, do whatever the checklists were, and I would do just fine. I was in grad school as well, and the Department Admin said that this department was not suitable for me then. I was shocked as I thought as a great leader, we supposed to encourage and motivate our staff to reach higher in life. I reported it to HR for investigation, and..... nada. Again, I was nobody for them, and I was not an asset to them, plus with everyone wanted to work for Kaiser, they probably glad I was out their company. I finally resigned after 13 years considering my mental health and my family well being is more important than staying in Kaiser for a great pay and salary.

There are hardly ever any appointments available to schedule which causes members to be frustrated and take it out on you. Hard to empathize with members because your calls will be consistently monitored, anything wrong that comes out of your mouth will be used against you. You are expected to keep calls under a certain time, any personal time used is to be kept to a minimum and they will track you over time, essentially what they are looking for are robots. Team managers will try to make you think it is a positive place to work at and throw in a few words of encouragement here and there, but don\u2019t help when you need it and when you do find a way of reaching them they give you the run around on things or attitude. They are typically chit chatting, eating, away from their desks at another TM\u2019s desk gossiping. You have almost no chance of getting a better schedule as there are employees who have been with the organization for many years and still stuck with a schedule that takes up almost your whole day. The organization supposedly values \u201cspeak up culture\u201d, but the moment that an employee speaks up about something, they are shut down and targeted. Most team supervisors have no experience within the organization, most do not hold any degrees, and are extremely unprofessional, but it makes sense as it is just a call center environment. When hired ,employees are told that they like to hire and promote within which is false. An outsider has the same luck as someone who already works within the organization. Another thing to keep in mind is that calls are not distributed equally. If you are good at the job, you will be working 2-3x harder than others and not getting compensated.

The work really matters. As an internal consultant, you often get to see the fruits of your labor through to implementation. \r\n- A great place to be involved with relevant issues hitting the healthcare industry. Kaiser is also ahead of the curve in a lot of healthcare matters, which is awesome. \r\n- The people in the department are so smart and driven. It\u2019s a great environment to be in for learning and development. There is a collegiate and supportive culture from peers. \r\n- PTO and health benefits are extremely competitive, and probably even better than tech companies in the Bay Area. (However, they have the upper hand in way more free perks!) \r\n- The department gets to be at the center of most (if not all) strategic projects happening at KP, which range from advocating for policy to clinical delivery enhancements and patient engagement. It's very rewarding to be at the crux of change at such a large org. \r\n- Good mix of strategy x operations x management consulting in healthcare \r\n- Strong opportunities for KP senior leadership exposure & relationship building \r\n- Overall, a really good place to be if you can get past tone deaf senior leadership and know how to consistently advocate for yourself for growth opportunities. There has been change in senior leadership recently. It's still too early to tell, but hopefully this will mean a positive outlook for the future.\r\n\r\n(One thing to note, for some reason Glassdoor is indicating I do not approve of the CEO, but I am actually just neutral)", "cons": "- Upper management puts the organization over the people, which is not good for long-term employee retention.\r\n- There needs to be a better way to match consultants with projects that are truly interesting to them - especially after being at the company for more than a year. Management, please take inputs and actually act on them, rather than hastily assigning consultants to projects in a reactive way. When working on 2-4 projects at a time, consultants should be on at least ONE project that they are truly passionate about, or that at least helps them build/flex skills they are targeting. \r\n- Did not feel there was significant thought put towards staff safety or comfort during the pandemic; even when every other company was working from home, it seemed like senior leadership had an expectation that people shouldn\u2019t be too far from the office, when the norm should have been the opposite. We weren't even able to leave the state to be with families due to HR policy. Hopefully this changes as remote work continues to be ironed out... \r\n- There is just a divide between antiquated ideas of business practice from leadership and a dynamic, innovative culture from the consulting staff."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Nice Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Manager in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Benefits, Great People, Great opportunities for growth", "cons": "None that comes to mind at this time."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "n/a", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Aug 2022", "job_title": "APPOINTMENT CLERK in Los Angeles, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "remote, stable, consistent, nothing else to add", "cons": "micro managed at times, issues with time off/seniority"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Kaiser New Grads", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Nurse Extern in Vallejo, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pros include salary, good & well known facility, benefits", "cons": "Cons can be shift hours if you prefer 12s."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "CSR2", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Aug 2022", "job_title": "CsrII in Fulton, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great benefits, remote work, time off, and pay.", "cons": "Favoritism between management and employees.
