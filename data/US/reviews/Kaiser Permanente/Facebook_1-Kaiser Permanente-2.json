your schedule; most providers do not take a lunch break.\r\n- Extreme demands on the provider lead to compromised quality of care; patients are booked every 3 to 6 weeks.\r\n- People with mild symptoms effectively do not receive care; the only patients who get priority for visits are those who are very symptomatic or who pose a threat to themselves or others.\r\n- The focus is on symptom management rather than healing and growth, so underlying psychological issues tend not to be addressed.\r\n- Providers are forced to be on the defense to avoid liability, especially in charting. Care provision is tainted by the company's drive to protect itself from possible patient lawsuits.\r\n- Management continually describes Kaiser as number one in patient care.

With my current manager, she has provided us with information (and implemented huddles) which I never received with my previous managers.  \r\nLazy employees who get away with it! Management can't do much or go up the chain of discipline with union workers. One major barrier is the laughable Labor Management Partnership. It is NOT a partnership. It's a joke. As a result, Kaiser could become an awesome powerhouse of a medical organization but they have lazy, unaccountable workers - from Housekeeping (EVS) to Leadership. \r\nMiddle managers get a ton of work and responsiblity put on their plate. New managers do not get much in terms of training. They are overworked and unfairly scapegoated with a problem occurs in their department."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "If You Are Not in the Allied Health Sciences Stay Away", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Pasadena, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None i can immediately think of.", "cons": "I am a non medical professional assigned to the southern California headquarters in Pasadena, California.

I bought my own office chair and monitor because they could jot provide a new monitor for me nor could they find a clean chair for me.  There is no coffee and no water to drink.
