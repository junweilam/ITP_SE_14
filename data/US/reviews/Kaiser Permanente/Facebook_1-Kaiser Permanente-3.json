Other than that, recognition of a job well done is not always shown in tangible ways, but then again, it is very much dependent on who your manager is."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "KP: Great People in IT, Healthcare marginal", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "26 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Oakland, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working in IT is great.

That unit was a horrible place to work. No break room and we all know that 30 minutes lunch is not enough to go to the cafeteria which was at least 5 mins to get there. The manager of the unit is useless.  I tried to let her know about the situation but she did not take a few minutes to discuss. They treat you as if you are not human. Kaiser Thrives...that's a joke. I worked there a short time and quit. I was getting sick, dehydrated. If they relieve you for a break or lunch don't expect them to cover your medication or do anything for your patients. I've had a full time job at another hospital for many years and tried Kaiser because it was close to my house but it was a huge mistake.

This is one of the most stable large IT organizations that you can find. Lots of IT FTEs in Kaiser have 10+ or even 20+ years. KPIT offers incredible benefits to their FT employees:\r\n- Paid medical insurance for associate and family - this alone can amount to multiple thousands every year\r\n- Pension - KPIT is one of the few remaining large entities that is offering an actual PENSION to their FTEs, which comes on top of the regular 403b retirement plans pre-tax and after-tax plans. The KPIT Pension is calculated using  the following formula 1.5% x Number of years at KP x average salary of the last five years of employment. For those with many years at KPIT, the KP Pension can easily translate in anywhere from $30,000/yr to 50,000/yr. Again, this is on top of your own retirement accounts. Just think about 20 years of retirement - this could easily add up to 600K to 1 Million in retirement money that comes on top of the retirement savings. Which companies can still offer an actual PENSION to their employees? To me this is a golden benefit for which I don't have enough words of praise\r\n- Vacation - you start at 3 weeks, year 2 to year 4 you get four weeks of vacation, year 5 to year 9 you get five weeks of vacation, year 10 and longer you get SIX weeks of paid vacation. How many companies provide that much vacation, that you can actually take? Twice now I've maxed out my six weeks of vacation, one time for a six weeks trip to Europe\r\n- Flexible work arrangements (telecommuting is made available for all FTEs)\r\n- Outstanding learning opportunities both online and in classroom style\r\n- Stability of the work force - Kaiser is a non-profit organization, which is not subject to shareholders will and stock market ups and downs.

(George Halverson was the CEO of Kaiser until July 2013.)\r\n- If your group is not busy, you usually manage work-life balance and close to a 40-hour workweek\r\n- If you must travel a longer distance than to your \"normal\" workplace, such travel is paid for by Kaiser (mileage only if less than an hour's drive away, \"full\" travel costs beyond that)\r\n- Kaiser does not discriminate based on age and is willing to train people for a skill when they realize that skill is not readily available in the local workforce\r\n- Good vacation policy: 17 days off the first year, 22 days off the second year, increasing further after 5 years on the job\r\n- Kaiser \"Healthtalks\" - you can learn all sorts of interesting information to improve your own health monthly (this is also available to members on the Kaiser health plan)\r\n- Relatively low monthly premiums for health care compared to other employers\r\n\r\n\"Neutral\" things about working at Kaiser:\r\n- This place is very project-oriented with matrix management\r\n- If you want to work from home, you can do so easily in most IT jobs (although in some areas, you're now required to go to the office one day per month for networking reasons)\r\n- Because so many people work from home, the culture is to get things done with instant messages (via Lotus Sametime), Webex, and phone conferences", "cons": "Negatives of working at Kaiser:\r\n- Politics.  Management politics will cause \"strange\" things to happen (for example, multiple groups doing the same thing even though that is a waste of money).\r\n- Lack of transparency.  When I started this job, I asked about overtime and was told (correctly) that there wasn't much overtime.  However, they failed to tell me until after I was hired that strange shifts were required, including weekend shifts and 2nd and 3rd shift.  Further, even \"first shift\" (during go-lives) is a strange shift that's great for 24-hour operations (typically 6 AM - 2:30 PM) but is unnatural for people used to working first shift at the office at other IT shops.   \r\n- The \"Cubicle police\": If you want to have an office in Pleasanton, watch out!  You better come to the office (and badge into the building) at least 3 times per week, and you better log on to the network mostly from your office, or else you'll suddenly be declared \"100% remote\" and forced to work from home whether you want to or not.  (In at least one case, they did not give the person the option to return to 100% full-time at the office.)\r\n- Lack of choice: Many low-level managers do not bother to give people the choice of what type of work they want to do, because low-level managers are mostly project-focused.\r\n- Lack of work-life balance during \"crunch\" periods: During go-lives, although they said they would keep people on the same shift throughout a week, that was ignored when they suddenly needed to fill a slot.  I've had periods where I've worked day shift, night shift (the next night), day shift (second day after the night shift).  I had a second shift, third shift, and first shift, all in one 5-day period.  I knew another person who suddenly was needed to create some training due the next week - she was basically denied her sleep for most of a week.  Management seems to think treating people this way is acceptable and does not do much to avoid this behavior.\r\n- No paid sick leave.  (Unionized folks - nurses, lab personnel, and other groups, do get paid sick leave and shift differentials but non-unionized folks - most of IT - don't.)\r\n- The worst of all worlds between salaried and hourly.  You are a salaried employee but you're required to report hours (for project reporting) on a technology platform called RPM.  The result is management will tend to harass you if you don't report 40 hours in a week, even though you aren't paid for overtime.\r\n- Casual-ness about required travel.  They think nothing about putting people on planes to help with other regions' go-lives or to go to meetings (since many groups and divisions have people across multiple divisions).\r\n- Inability to take requested vacation days during crunch periods (while other employers have claimed this ability, this is the first employer I've encountered to actively use it).  Further, this denial of vacation is just based on the \"possibility\" that something may go wrong during the time period asked for, not because something has actually gone wrong and needs to be fixed.\r\n- Bureaucracy as a way of life, including unnecessary bureaucracy.  For example, Kaiser employees are not allowed to buy anything on the Internet for their personal use while on the job.  So, if you know you're off next weekend and want to go to a play or out camping, too bad - your counterpart at another tech firm will get the reservation or ticket, not you.  There is no reason why Kaiser employees should be restricted in this way.  Similarly, contractors are not allowed to send emails to most non-Kaiser addresses for security reasons.  Can you say \"lack of trust\"?\r\n- Cost-cutting in the employee medical plan.  For example, too bad if your vision prescription changed within one year, Kaiser will only pay for glasses every two years.\r\n- A culture of hiring employees for only 2 years or less plus policies that guarantee no retirement benefits for anyone there two years or less.  (There is no company match on their 403(b) - 401(k)-equivalent - plan, and their pension plan does not vest until after you've worked two years.  A lot of employees are hired for \"maximum 2 years - we'll keep you if we have the work\" but they often don't have the work to keep you after 2 years.\r\n- A job/project focus, not a career focus.  They have a mentoring program that has monthly phone calls, but if you use it, you're required to listen to those calls on your own time, not on the job, and the mentoring program feels like \"lip service\" in a culture that is focused on short-term getting the project completed over everything else.\r\n- FInally, it was announced last year that where-ever possible, new IT jobs would be in Colorado or Oregon, not California, for cost-cutting reasons.

It's not a healthy place to work, even though it promotes that 'healthy' message to its customer base. Both upper and lower management is incredibly inept and is rewarded for being so, and again.

They talk about \"Kaiser\" as though it was the Great and Powerful Oz (the wizard), some nameless, faceless, uncaring entity trying to exploit them and which, in turn, should be exploited.  They don't understand that it's a highly competitive world, and to continue to get good pay and great benefits, they and the company they work for have to succeed in that competitive environment.  Likewise, some members have similar misconceptions, and want the latest, most costly drugs, tests, and other services, even when there is no evidence those are any better than what has been established, and they want these things at below cost.  They don't see a relationship between their premiums (mine too) and the cost of these services.  That's one problem with prepaid healthcare.\r\nThe other big thing for me personally is the discrepancy between the pay and benefits for the MDs vs other providers and people who work alongside them.  In fairness, those physicians usually work extremely hard, especially in primary care, but sometimes it seems outrageous what they get that others don't.  And the culture is very physician-centric.  Some argue that is a strength of KP, as compared to healthcare systems that are run by business people, but that physician-centeredness is often exclusive, just a different version of an 'old boys network' that can cause undercurrents of resentment among others in the organization.

They're comfortable, counting the days to retirement, and since change would take them out of their comfort zone, they steadfastly resist it.  \r\n\r\nToo much of the work and budget within Program Offices is ultimately decided on the basis of personal relationships, and not on the basis of quantitative measures.

From the incompetence & cost overruns of our IT dept to all the political infighting and bureaucracy, this place is a complete mess. Apparently this is what happens in a monstrously large organization that's not-for-profit.\r\n\r\nMost of the senior managers have been with the company forever. They've become thoroughly accustomed to the \"Kaiser way,\" i.e. low quality work getting done at a snails pace through a process of tedious negotiations. Too many cooks in the kitchen, and there usually isn't an executive chef. Just a bunch of sous chefs running around like idiots.\r\n\r\nIt's probably the least empowering environment possible because at the end of the day, you realize that your work has no real impact on the 160,000-employee monster known as Kaiser Permanente.\r\n\r\nIf you're a young person looking to move up quickly, then this is definitely not the place for you. Here you'll be surrounded by a bunch of mediocre 9-to-5ers, and management will ask you to wait your turn regardless of your performance. On top of that, they have all these idiotic rules such as: raises are capped at 10%, or promotions can only be given after a certain number of performance evaluation cycles. They do a poor job of addressing underperformance, and they're horrible at rewarding excellence.\r\n\r\nAnd company culture? What company culture? It's just a job. Everybody shows up, puts in their hours, and goes home. That Thrive campaign? It's just a marketing gimmick. There isn't a single company policy that actually encourages their employees to \"Thrive.\"\r\n\r\nOf course all of this depends on the department and manager, but generally speaking, this is what I've seen so far at Kaiser.

The KPB building on Multnomah is very close to downtown and the possibilities of lunch are almost endless..this was great.\r\n\r\nManagement people seem pretty happy (I think they are paid pretty well..) So they are easy going people that will help you with your personal needs.\r\n\r\nThey offered me more money when I went to quit (this could be a good or bad thing depending how you think about this).\r\n\r\nGood benefits, seriously...If you do get sick and when you are able to actually go get checked out, its very easy to get taken care of!  I called in, got an appointment the next day..they checked me out and gave me all the prescriptions I needed right away.  On my plan I didn't even pay a dime at the doctor's appointment.. The plan that came out of my paycheck was dirt cheap compared to other companies.  Definitely the greatest part about working here is that if you ever get some serious ailment, you are in good hands.", "cons": "Anyone can get a job at Kaiser, this is a good thing if you are desperate for a job..but leave it at that because this is not a place where I would recommend working for a long time.  I worked here in between jobs to get by and pay the bills.  Some of my colleagues were wayyy over qualified with Phd's and others had very mediocre backgrounds..  I'm not from an Ivy league school or anything, but I have a rather seasoned resume I felt was endangered by the discombobulation represented at Kaiser...So I left for a much better job at a better company.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of good people at Kaiser, unfortunately there are a few who bring it down.. The few bad ones that I noted came from unimpressive backgrounds that seemingly wanted to feel a level of control over their peers, the good thing was that I didn't find that these people were in management so you could choose to ignore them when you felt like it.\r\n\r\nThe pay at Kaiser for non-exempt full-time employees is not good, but I have seen cheaper companies out there.. Non-exempt full-time non-management employees are given on average the worst remuneration in the entire company.  The PTO time accumulated is normal compared to fortune 500 companies, but the sick time is horrid for non-exempt full-time employees (unionized employees are treated much better in respect to this).  Because Kaiser is a health care company, people at the office often travel back and forth to the hospital..  Hospitals (as much as they'd like to proclaim their cleanliness) are known cess pools of disease.  You WILL get sick here, even if you are not the type to get sick.. You WILL.  It takes more than 3 months to acquire 1 day of sick time, this is definitely not enough.  You will be going to work sick or using your PTO time.  In other fortune 500 companies you will get 3 sick days up front plus PTO..this would be more fair.  The company also sends out emails that state you must come to work..even in severe weather (huge lawsuit waiting to happen with this one..).  During fire alarms, they made us go down two floors and you are told not to leave the building..there are no repercussions for exiting the building during fire alarms.  Smoke was detected in the building, people went down 2 floors and waited there for atleast 30 minutes to an hour with no further notification of what was happening (this is another major lawsuit waiting to happen).\r\n\r\nThe other big con here is that while a lot of companies have plenty of meetings, I feel that this place goes overboard.  You will have hour long meetings over the most menial tasks..  I remember a meeting that was an hour long discussion about whether or not someone should rename a file..and in the end of the meeting it was decided to not rename the file because it wouldn't change anything for the company.  A lot of the meetings here are designed to micromanage you, they will insult your intelligence by proclaiming they are not designed for the purposes of micromanagement..  Rounding every two weeks with a manager (ugh!).  The manager will pretty much tell you you are always doing a good job and keep it up, they want to know the dirt.\r\n\r\nGeorge Halvorson reminds me of the Wizard of Oz..does he crank the machine behind a curtain?
