You can most likely get a slightly smaller base salary out of the gate, and they sometimes offer sign-on bonuses/loans when they feel like it and to whom they think worthy but avoid taking this as they will undoubtedly ask for it back even if you move roles within Kaiser. I\u2019ve seen this happen many times and see the same issues with the home loan. Back to the salary. The recruiting team will show you an expected salary after five years of service, reflecting a 5% increase each year. This is false and misleading. Even with the highest productivity with your group and very high patient satisfaction surveys, you will receive a generic letter in the mail thanking you for another year of dedication and a rate of increase less than 0.80% that feels more like a slap in the face. All the while, record inflation is rampant throughout the country at the same time when we live in the most expensive part of the country in California. \r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, during the pandemic, while we have been putting our lives on the line every day and putting our families at risk while Kaiser is making record profits of over $2 BILLION per quarter, they took away our overtime pay while on service. So, we step up, and they reduce our salary. Where is the fairness in that? We are certainly not treated like family at Kaiser like they love to tout. We are treated like third-rate expendable profit machines without the benefit of sharing the fruits of our 14-hour daily labors. \r\n\r\nThe Kaiser model is not sustainable for the physician as you would be doing yourself a disservice in the long run for remaining at Kaiser. It might be feasible for two-three years max but less lucrative and tiring long term. There is no administration time while panel maximums are increased every time an intelligent physician leaves, and they decide not to backfill that position to save money. Everything at Kaiser ultimately comes down to profit and more ways to extract that profit from the physicians who give their lives for a system to take it away. \r\n\r\nThere is an article titled why I left Kaiser that I recently came across with a quick internet search, and I recommend that you read it as well.
