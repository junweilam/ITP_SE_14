In light of the Radonda verdict, this is especially appalling. With a few notable exceptions, the majority of the residents do not have a sense of responsibility, follow-up, or even accountability for basic information they should know. As a new nurse if I have to consistently remind you that an order is inappropriate for your patient, you should be ashamed. \r\nAdministrators are not supportive of nursing staff; nursing educators, higher-level nursing administrators just want their metrics to improve by squeezing more out of the nurses doing all the work instead of doing more to support them,\r\nThe charting system is nominally better than messenger pigeon. In order to properly care for your patient with the limited resourcing available and to document everything properly, you regularly stay very late.

She did very little to make me and other observers feel safe before the pandemic. It was the patient's safety before our own.The issue became worse during the first wave on the pandemic. We were not allowed to have anything more than a surgical mask but were still assigned covid patients(you don't go into the rooms,she told us). She promised in the beginning we wouldn't have any.That changed quickly. Then it was only\"droplet precautions\".Once she told me I would have \"airborne precaution\" patients,I gave her my two weeks notice. I already felt stressed worrying about my co-workers and that was the last straw. Please always remember,you have the right to not only feel safe but be safe. Protect your patient and your co-workers as best you can but don't harm yourself in the process.\r\n-Inconsistent training. I was shown a 30 minute video on how to properly feed a patient and no other training. Another observer was prepped fully. \r\n-Depending on the shift and unit,you'll probably be on your own. Just do your best.Press the call bell and yell out for help. Don't let yourself get hurt because other staff members refuse to help.You're there to \"observe\". However if the nurse or aide asks for something reasonable like cleaning the patient's face while they're washing the rest of them,there is nothing wrong with that. Do what makes you feel comfortable and within reason but keep yourself safe.\r\n-You will have patients that should not be with you. If you don't feel safe with a patient,speak up.Your safety is number 1 before the patient.Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.Always cover yourself. If the patient fell make sure you write down if you intervened in order to prevent their fall and if you couldn't,write why. I had a patient trying to punch me in the face and they fell but I was able to make sure they didn't hit their head. With a patient fall,some people are looking to place the blame on someone. Document properly. Do your job to the best of your ability. \r\n-Very stressful when the patient is very bad.Again it's your job to observe and not be a human punching bag. Ask to be moved if the patient is harassing you.You don't deserve to deal with that for 8 hours."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "I really enjoy everyone I work with and the family atmosphere of the hospital", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in New Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very family oriented \nA lot of staff has been there for a long time 10+ years", "cons": "Managemt is typically just worried about bottom dollar \nLook to your coworkers for support not the higher ups they are worthless"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, Emergency Room in New Brunswick, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "team oriented in the ED and the push for nursing further education", "cons": "no staffing, administration does not care for all employees"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Workplace", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Somerset, NJ", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Location has diverse patients, will learn a lot", "cons": "Salary could be higher.
