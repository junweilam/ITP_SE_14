RWMC created it's own Insurance Company.  Benefits are great (NOT)", "cons": "RWMC is a Strong Arm Bully in a very rural panhandle. Your initial contract has a \"No Union\" clause.  In 1999 the nursing staff was all set to be unionized.  The RWMC made a deal with nursing staff to not get into a Union but the hospital instead would respond to their requests and have a nursing staff manager for every department with an open door policy for staff to voice nursing and other concerns.  By 2002 there was a no Union clause policy written in the new employees contracts.  It was great to be employed by RWMC from 1999 to 2002.  Management bent over backwards to accommodate employees requests.  Raises for performance were given out on quarterly basis.  The old CIO was forced to resign due to embezzling funds for new construction and had contractors work on his home being built.  Over a ten year period my family racked up over $30,000 in out of pocket medical expense.  The Hospitals newly created insurance company was like a bad slot machine and hardly ever paid out.  Local attorney's would never take a malpractice case or any insurance cases against RWMC.  A couple firms said and I quote \"I and my family live in this community.  I have relatives who work there.  Most small local affordable law firms will not take a case against RWMC due to possible repercussions.  I have had friends and family work in RWMC since 2012.  The hospital wasn't making money.  Cleaning staff could not use a anti bacterial cleaning solution.  Just soap and water to clean.  Nursing and other staff started rationing toilet paper because RWMC said they had to make cutbacks so being able to order staff toiletries would not be happening until further notice.  2014 3rd floor visitors lounge had a bug infestation.  Floor was not closed down.  Nursing staff is overworked causing mistakes.  Too many management positions.  Most who hold supervisory or management are well under qualified.  Most management on salary will put their hours in, mainly in meetings,  and will not help when short staffed. Favoritism  with hourly staff and management runs rapent.  I have heard many complaints of hostile work environments in most hospital areas to include the clinics.  One person described it like \"Not being part of the in crowd in high school all over again.\"  Problems and concerns fall on deaf management ears and if you go over your supervisor's, you are labeled a discruntaled employee.  CNAs and support staff are lucky to be paid between $10-$13 an hour.  Management and administration salaries are way to high for this hospital.  The nearest trauma 3 hospital from this area is in Cheyenne Wy.  1:45 minutes away.  The hospitals urgent care turns patients away.  The alternative is to make an appointment with your primary physician (two to five business days of wait or the Emergency room at RWMC.  No other choices. Monopoly, bully, strong arm legal mob.  Take your pick.  Working at RWMC is a dead end miserable job.
