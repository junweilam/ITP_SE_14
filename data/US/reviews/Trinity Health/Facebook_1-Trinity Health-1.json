I didn\u2019t get to touch any part of that bonus because I didn\u2019t chit chat with my coworkers. This boss always seemed to have a problem with the way I was doing something ( even as simple as checking people in) I was trained and I asked questions daily but that still want enough. She had expectations for me to be just as good as the other 2 receptionist who have 10+ years of experience and I have never even done this before.

One last thing is that my boss and 2 others were able to leave for a week and I handled the front desk great, but she still didn\u2019t think I was good enough for her.

Which means prepare for more future calls coming your way, possibly\r\n-only 30 min for lunch, two fifteen min breaks\r\n-sick, vacation and time off are all taken from pto earned\r\n-an excellent employee will barley get a 4\u2105 raise.  If a person isn't the best expect a 2-3\u2105 raise, or even less\r\n-poor communication/transparency from management at times\r\n-very stressful due mainly to the high call volume. Forty to fifty, sometimes even sixty calls a day is the norm. \r\n -holiday pay is only time and a half instead of double now\r\n -burnout is inevitable\r\n -open office environment\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, know this is a call center job.  Despite the many cons, this job really did help me out in some ways.  It got me exposed to healthcare IT, which looks good when applying to other higher level tech jobs in the medical field.  Don't get too comfortable, that is what management wants.  Do your time, and when a year hits please start looking elsewhere, and not in help desk.

They were not good employees that made even worse middle management and they were never provided with the training to treat employees with any kind of respect.  Now thanks to Covid and Trinity having to reduce a large number of unnecessary expenses, upper management was forced to review their payroll and justify what positions were necessary for the company to continue with a much lower operating budget.  In doing this, all those employees that had not been doing their job were let go.  Yes, some good people were let go too but for the most part the overall moral is good considering so much dead weight has been shed.\nAdvancement:  Upper management always talked about the avenues that are available for people to grow and advance at the company.  Apparently in the past, it was very easy for people without the skills to advance which may be the reason it is impossible now.  They tell you that you can advance here at Trinity so that you don\u2019t leave to seek the advancement elsewhere.  Currently, if they decide that they are \u201cconsidering\u201d promoting you then you have to fill out a promotion plan outlining why you think you should get the promotion.  Then if your manager and about 3 others above them think that you are worthy, then you start a one year process of projects and approved work that if you successfully complete, you then have your year long plan reviewed.
