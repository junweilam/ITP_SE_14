They don't invest in continued education. Upper Management decides your faith without knowing what it takes to make things work. A lot of long hours with no compensation for some. No one is treated equal. The health insurance is unaffordable.  You a basically forced to receive all your healthcare needs here and there's no security in place which means everyone knows all your business and believe me they share it. Some of the Physician are very disrespectful but because they are considered God management does nothing. They constantly say they have no financial means for raises, better benefits etc for the administrative staff but are constantly adding COO, CEO, CIO etc position while the people doing all the work are barely making it.  A lot of the employees find themselves applying for state medical because they cannot afford the benefits the offer. I wonder why the offices on the 10th floor are enclosed like a fortress and when all those big money people get on the elevator with the other employees they turn their noses up like the smell something. I ve there 4 years with no raise and now they are saying still no raises but they keep giving these employee reviews telling you to do more really.
