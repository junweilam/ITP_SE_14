With that being said, I do NOT recommend anyone to apply to this department. It has been unorganized, unprofessional, dishonest, and much more since the beginning. Unless you previously worked with management at the other hospital they came from, you will NOT be treated fairly. Favoritism is evident throughout this department. Promotion is given to friends versus qualified professionals. Hence, the lack of professionalism displayed by management. If you speak up and against management, you can guarantee that there will be some form of retaliation against you. I suggest applying to a different area of the hospital or applying with another organization. There is a complete lack of proper training for new employees once they arrive on the floor (i.e. several med errors, etc.) The wages and benefits are a complete joke. Do NOT waste your time or experience at this hospital. This organization is not patient-focused like they try to portray. It is like any other healthcare facility; it is a business. Once again, look for a better paying and positive position elsewhere."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Growing pains", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Idaho Falls, ID", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Willing to hire new graduates", "cons": "Unorganized management and minimal procedural structure."}]]
