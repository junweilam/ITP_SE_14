The concerns raised in previous reviews have not been addressed by the senior management team.  In fact, they respond to most people's concerns by saying that if people don't like it, then they can leave.  This has been stated numerous times by the CEO and a few others.  Instead of addressing the many concerns about the CFOO, who in fact treats most people in a bullying manner and with complete disrespect, the CEO has chosen to ignore the information.  The CFOO employs a CYA strategy every minute of the day.  The senior team has tried to implement some measures to help the low morale problem, but a few raffles won't solve the problem when management team members only care about themselves and those who they view most favorably.  Any growth at NQF is reserved for the QI team and select people from the QM team .  Also, regarding the outsourced Human Resources staff, they main person has shown over and over again that she will act only as the CFOO desires.  As stated before, a number of concerns have been raised about the CFOO and his behavior, but each time she has shown her complete allegiance to him.  NQF is also suffering because rather than admit that many of senior management don't have the skills necessary to run  various aspects of the company, they act like the staff is the problem.  The fact that NQF has only one main source of funding is a concern too.  What happens if the one main source of funding decides to reduce the amount given to NQF?
