The CEO, CFO and VPs were constantly out on LOA, sick or vacation.  This behavior was not acceptable by non-management staff.  Additionally, when they were in the office, they were in very nice catered lunch meetings.  Any additional food was packed up so it could be taken home to their families and not offered to staff.  Also, a yearly raffle was held and often management won the big prizes.  Some of the management were given company cars and they could be seen running errands in them during the weekend. All the desk and chairs  non-management got were used and broken down - management always got brand new ones.\r\n\r\nOutside of the selfishness, management ruled with an 'iron fist' and were flat-out rude.  They was micromanagement across all departments. The CEO literally opened every piece of mail sent to the organization instead of managing the staff.   When in the office, the CEO would stare out of the windows to catch employees coming in late.  The Home Health management team was known to talk over staff and undermine other departments.  The CFO on many occasions walked off of site to the Claremont Village before lunch and was never seen until an hour before his time to go home.  Human Resources was the hiring and firing team, nothing else.\r\n\r\n The pay and benefits were terrible! Some years no raises were given and others a 3% max, even when one reduced costs and streamlined other processes.  The retirement plan offered very poor choices for investments.  For being a health organization, the insurance was VERY expensive out of pocket.  So much so, that my family opted to go to Kaiser directly to pay significantly less in premiums.\r\n\r\nIf you were not an RN or manager, you were treated poorly.  It often felt like RNs could do no bad.  I understand they are 'bringing in the money'; however, favoritism creates a poor work environment.  \r\n\r\nI felt really bad for the Businesses Development team, administrative staff and IT department."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management Team Difficult to work with", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Community Liaison in Claremont, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay was decent, close to home, the position was one that made you feel good about what you were doing at the end of the day.", "cons": "No creativity, their way was the only way.if you want to be micromanaged, this is the place for you.
