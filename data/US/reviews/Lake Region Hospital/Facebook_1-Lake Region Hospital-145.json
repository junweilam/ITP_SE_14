We each have different workloads as far as complexity and time needed to do a quality job. Some have less complex  departments to code which is fine  but yet ALL are expected to do the same number of charts per day if they would like the flexibility to work from home offices just a couple days a week. This is unrealistic and unfair.  Those with less complicated workloads are able to produce higher numbers and are allowed to work from home.  Those with departments with higher complexity, multiple procedures and research required are either forced to not put necessary time into their charts to raise numbers, or they can keep doing  a  high quality job and have to remain working in house every day.  Coding a basic clinic visit and an occasional simple procedure takes much less time than complicated and often multiple procedures plus an office visit.  We currently have no caring,understanding  and rigidness  by management as they do not look further than surface numbers and general statistics. Thus we have a very unhappy group with many skilled  dedicated workers with years of experience who are actively looking for new opportunities elsewhere. Management has ignored concerns and has made snotty comments that have made employees feel undervalued and the job they do unimportant."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Okay for an entry level, short term job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Reimbursement Analyst in Fergus Falls, MN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "New facilities, but there seems to be a big disconnect between upper management and front line staff.
