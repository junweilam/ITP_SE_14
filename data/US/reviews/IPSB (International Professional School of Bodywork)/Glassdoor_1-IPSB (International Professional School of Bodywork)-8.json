Great students, great faculty.", "cons": "I've never worked at a place that was so shady. They paid both students their financial aid money and employees late on a regular basis. Paychecks sometimes bounced. They broke Federal regulations consistently. The director was dishonest and lied often. When she wanted to fire someone she sent someone else and locked herself in her office until they left. In an office of like 7 people you don't treat people that way. I've never been more mistreated than at this job. Terrible health benefits, no eye or dental, low pay."}], []]
