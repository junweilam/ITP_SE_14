Care is sub-optimal in many different medical conditions and clinical settings throughout the organization. Although delivering high-quality care is important to all clinicians, this issue may be particularly relevant to certain subgroups, such as nurses, physicians, leadership and P.I. department. You also see less specialized training and those who seek no interaction from patients and those who spend time or see a smaller volume of patients compared to others. The tragic thing when you look at Performance improvement department and Core Measures and the lack of quality initiatives identified fall directly with leadership. While they should be coordinating, educating  and implementing improvements to identify gaps in performance it comes truly comes down to not caring for the patients and follow through as you can review in H.C.A.H.P.S. (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems).\r\nPhysicians have a caudle affect especially those who have been in practice for more years, or those that fundamentally do not actually care may also be less likely to deliver high-quality care. Medical advances occur frequently, and the explicit knowledge that physicians possess may easily become out of date. Therefore, although it is generally assumed that the tacit knowledge and skills accumulated by physicians during years of practice lead to superior clinical abilities; it is also plausible that physicians with more experience may paradoxically be less likely to provide technically appropriate care.\r\nPerformance Improvement department becomes a performance circle scenario and data remains inaccurate throughout the organization. When you review how important existing studies have had with specific goals of evaluating the effects of experience on the quality of medical care. However, length of time in clinical practice has been included as part of a set of physician characteristics this too might explain variations in quality or that may be con-founders of the association between quality and other factors.\r\nUltimately it comes down to fictitious data that\u2019s easily manipulated to lean one way or the other by the interpreter.
