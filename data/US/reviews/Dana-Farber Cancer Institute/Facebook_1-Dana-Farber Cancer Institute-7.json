However, during the interview at the Brockton, Massachusetts location, the interviewer displayed extreme rudeness, rushed through my responses, and asked an inappropriate question. Unfortunately, this led me to decide not to proceed and finish the interview. I acknowledge that this isolated incident does not reflect the company as a whole, as I still believe it is a great organization to work for. However, I believe it is important to share my experience to potentially benefit other applicants. Throughout my career, I have undergone numerous interviews and have never encountered anything negative or felt compelled to leave a negative review.

And if you aren't willing to do the same then you're threatened with the \"if you want my recommendation for grad/med school\" card. The amount of times this was used against me was immense. All of the other research/lab techs I've spoken with since leaving left very shortly as well, and they've since opened up and admitted that their experience was also incredibly toxic. We all struggled to get good LORs even though we were working all the time, including staying until midnight on Fridays and showing up at 8am on Saturdays. All because our managers were on a power trip and felt we needed to \"prove\" ourselves. The females were treated especially bad and yelled at and reprimanded for no reason, and our hard work blatantly dismissed. For example, when I tried to go above and beyond on an assignment I was told \"Okay I'm going to be blunt. You're just an assistant.\" When I or other females would ask questions, the manager would roll his eyes and dodge it altogether, but would then be quizzed on the spot on what the other people in the meeting had just said. When this was brought to our PI we were told it was going to be addressed only for matters to become worse, so we learned to stay quiet. On top of that when I left, my manager texted me threatening me that if I didn't do xyz (for free, by the way) then I was throwing away my chances at publication and LORs. This was after my last day at work and after having been promised lead co-authorship many months prior. \n\nOverall terrible experience and sad I was so tunnel-visioned that I didn't realize I deserved better.

Research Assistants/Administrative Assistants are rarely asked to contribute ideas in meetings and are seen as clerks that push paperwork through the huge bureaucracy of DFCI. Additionally, the workplace culture does not encourage any camaraderie around anything including the work that you do. One of my study teams threw a Christmas party and none of the MDs that worked on the study showed up OR responded to the invitation stating that they wouldn't make it. From my experience, the MDs at DFCI do not care about the staff that work below them and only view them as a means to an end. If you're looking for a workplace where upper-manamgent sees you as something more than a list of job functions I suggest you look beyond Dana-Farber.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is little to no room for growth in entry-level Research Assistant/CRC jobs. The pay is abysmal- especially when compared to the salaries of the higher-ups. I was explicitly told in my interview that I would not be able to advance from my role to a higher role without having a Master's degree. Many, many of my colleagues were told this as well. This attitude makes it so that everyone at DFCI puts an expiration date on their employment. I performed worse and did not feel inspired to go the extra mile because I knew that my extra efforts would not be rewarded with promotions and/or a significant raise. \r\n\r\nLastly, the management structure is significantly outdated. People do not interact face-to-face on anything other than in meetings, which many physicians blow off, leave early, or are only partially present because they have so many other things going on. Other staff easily excuse the behaviors of the physicians, however I did not find their excuses to be acceptable. People would work remotely and not let their subordinates aware of their absence from the office. My simple questions would go unanswered for weeks to months at times. Then I would get reprimanded for not having the answer to the question that I had posed multiple times. DFCI needs to look to other peer-institutions and more innovative healthcare companies to think about better ways to manage their research support staff."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great research resources, administrative support lacking", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 May 2016", "job_title": "Research Fellow/Associate in Boston, MA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Compared to other research institutions, it is great to have all necessary cores within one roof.

Attitudes and egos are ridiculous. Research staff are treated horribly by the \"principal investigators.\" Virtually ZERO support for career advancement of young research trainees. If you're a young researcher this is a great place to go and make one or two high impact papers, but then get out QUICK! If you're good, you're seen as future competition - not someone who should be supported and helped with career transition. Again, like much of Harvard Medical School things are extremely political! Incompetent scientists get hired as full time research faculty members if they came from the \"right\" labs as post-docs, even if they barely know the basics of putting together a simple scientifc experiment.  This may not be unique to DFCI and Harvard, but a problem with academia in general and one that seems to get worse as money gets tighter.
