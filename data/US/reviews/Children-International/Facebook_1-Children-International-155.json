After reading some of the criticisms in previous reviews, I felt compelled to share my own experience, which was positive overall, despite some challenges.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is necessary to address the organizational change taking place here. Four years ago, CI brought in a new President and CEO, Susana Eshleman. She had previously served on the Board of Directors for ten years, so she was familiar with and committed to the mission of Children International. Her approach has been what some, including myself, would consider radical in terms of driving the significant and all-encompassing change the organization needed in order to remain relevant and continue driving impact in the areas it serves. From what I have observed and heard from others, prior to Susana\u2019s arrival as CEO, the culture at CI was hierarchical, closed, fixed and stagnant. Environments like that stifle growth, innovation and the spirit of collaboration that inspire people to do great things together. To her credit, Susana saw that the organizational culture needed to be completely changed if CI was going to survive. It takes time and commitment to foster a healthy culture from within, and it is often difficult, even excruciating. And some people are simply not cut out for success in an environment where change is a constant. I believe that is reflected in many of the comments left by current and previous employees here. Nevertheless, making positive, productive changes to the organization\u2019s culture is what the CEO and CI\u2019s leadership team are committed to doing, and I applaud them for it.\r\n\r\nSecond, I would be remiss not to mention just how lovely the working environment is here. The office is impeccable, well-supplied and maintained, and in a beautiful, natural location with a pond and scenic views of nearby trails. Employees are kind, generous and care for one another in a way you often don\u2019t see in a corporate environment. I have met many people in my three years at the organization I am now proud to call friends. Although there is significant work to be done and it does feel that there are not enough hours in the day to get to to it all, the organization provides generous benefits to employees including retirement contributions, half day Fridays and the flexibility to work remotely as needed. To have all of this while being able to spend your days making a positive difference in the lives of others is truly a gift.", "cons": "Efforts are being made to improve organizational communication, which is currently a gap that leaves some feeling unheard, overlooked and out of the loop."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great people, great mission, but major problems with upper management and HR.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A lot of great people to work with\r\nHalf day fridays\r\nPositive mission overall\r\nStaff trip every 4 years to visit a charity supported region", "cons": "Nepotism and poor decision making in upper management and execeutive team\r\nBoard is clueless of internal operations\r\nHR doesn't care about employees\r\nPay below market value"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Director", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The programs that the company has put in place to lift children around the world out of poverty are  first rate and they are continually striving to ensure each regions gets it's own unique needs met.", "cons": "Leadership is struggling to be effective in managing through the massive amount of change that is needed to get the company back on track."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Many great improvements in the last 5 years", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Observations After A Year in Kansas City, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I read the polarized Glassdoor reviews before accepting a position in 2019.

In the past five years CI has spent considerable effort modernizing, rethinking its practices, making hard choices, and in general driving towards data-driven outcomes.  I came in near the end of this period, after many long-time associates who could not handle the changes left.  We have a new set of core values that have been well-socialized internally and everyone from one end of the building to the other is working hard to live up to.  I rarely see an open role (less than a handful over a year's time) which is a sign that people want to stay. The campus is exquisitely maintained. On a more practical note, we work a lengthened 4.5-day workweek  but have Friday afternoons off. That's a wonderful perk for busy professionals, even if it makes it a bit tough to squeeze in a workout Monday through Thursday.", "cons": "Despite having a significant number of HQ employees based remotely, and well appointed video-conference rooms and collaboration tools, CI as a whole is reluctant to adopt a remote work policy.

For those who work locally, but have to deal with lengthy with daily commutes in addition to the already-lengthened work day, it feels incongruous at best, unfair at worst.  Second, there are still areas of the company where tasks that would have long-since been automated elsewhere are still being managed manually, by spreadsheet, or worse on paper.

I also love my coworkers (though many of them are now gone). But I simply can't encourage anyone to work here at this time-and likely for at least the next 3-5 years as the organization tries to fix its problems.\r\n\r\nHere's why I'm writing this review:\r\n\r\nSince CEO Susana Eshleman was hired 3 years ago to replace former CEO Jim Cook, management has been a hot mess. She was inexperienced in running a large organization, having come from Hallmark, and it continues to show. To keep finances under control while she changed the strategy of the org (which was desperately needed), she eliminated the positions of multiple V.P.s. Then she hired new V.P.s who may have the best of intentions but are/were not up to the responsibilities they took on. (Like the new CEO, several of these individuals also had never worked at a nonprofit.) The executive team has thus turned to outside consultants and the hiring of outside P.R./marketing agencies -- again, people with good intentions but no familiarity with nonprofits. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion of these outsiders was to reorganize about half the company's staff in fall 2016, which almost immediately created silos with directors (or managers filling in for directors yet to be hired) not knowing how to handle their responsibilities. The V.P. in charge tried to take a backseat to give the directors the ability to forge their own ways. But that technique has been sadly ineffective and only made matters worse. Yet this V.P. and other top execs continue to wallow in indecisiveness, and newly hired directors have come in like bulls in a china shop, making decisions and giving orders that have left existing staff simply trying to \"duck and cover\" to avoid attention and trouble.\r\n\r\nAdditional layoffs this spring have reduced morale (which was already low) even further into the ground and also caused chaos as the org tries \"experiments\" in an effort to try to fix the continuing problems. Staff who are left are now overworked and overwhelmed. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this review is not even necessary as few career options at the organization are even available at this time. But for the positions that may open up or are currently available, consider this a heads up. You may be walking into an extremely complicated and negative situation."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Don't work here", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "N/A", "job_title": "N/A", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friday afternoons off\r\nSlick new building\r\nInformal attire\r\nFeeling like you could make a difference for kids in poor countries", "cons": "Like another review said, the place is a big bag of politics and nepotism. People are given offices and titles who are ridiculously incompetent. All their efforts, when they are not in endless meetings that produce nothing, go into putting smart people down so nobody gets a chance to show what professional standards in the rest of the working world actually look like. Everything is slow, bloated, and so complicated it's like a bad joke sometimes. You see people just sort of snark and shrug around the coffee machines, because they don't know what else to do. You will not be promoted on merit. There is no real management. Everybody gets to complicate every decision because nobody has the guts to define who's in charge of anything, so everyone feels entitled to be part of every decision. Everyone's an expert at Children International. Especially those who are actually completely unqualified. Our IT systems are so big and convoluted nobody knows how they work. Marketing just means throwing out as much as possible and hope some of it works. The Web sites (yes, they manage to churn out multiple, for one small company!) are embarrassing messes. It takes a special kind of talent to have so many people spend so much time in so many meetings and produce so little value. If you are smart and ambitious, you will be frustrated quickly, and you will have nothing to show for any time you spend here. Clueless people with titles will fight every good idea until you throw up your hands and quit, which is what they want so that they can run their little fiefdoms undisturbed.
