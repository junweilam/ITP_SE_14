Plus battling the ABA that is constantly changing their rules, seemingly to prevent the diverse population that TJSL and other 4th tier schools cater to from becoming lawyers.\r\n* From 2011/2012 there have been no raises for anyone (they said) but lied and for three years gave raises to faculty.\r\n* 5% pay cut when Thomas Guernsey arrived\r\n* Took away matching 401K about the same time\r\n* As much as a jerk Hasl was, at least he showed appreciation to the staff.  Once he left (a good thing overall) staff was on its own to pat itself on the back.\r\n* Hard to get a good bar pass rate when the ABA keeps changing the rules and many of the students don't follow guidelines set out by faculty and bar prep courses\r\n* Too small an IT department with no upper management guidance\r\n* Limited finances for necessary technology upgrades\r\n* New Dean promised transparency but avoids telling the truth to long-time loyal employees\r\n* When it came to recent layoff - no warning.
