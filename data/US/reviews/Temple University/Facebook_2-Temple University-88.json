It helps a lot with networking when you attend conferences, and it can be a boon to getting presentation proposals accepted. The student population at Temple makes for a very rewarding daily work experience. Temple has a very diverse student body that includes first-gen students, low-income students, students coming out of the foster care system, and of course students of color. Temple also puts its money where its mouth is with regard to accessibility services, so there is a good representation of students with disabilities. The benefits are good, including being able to use tuition remission. You can use pre-tax income to pay for a SEPTA pass, and there are a number of service discounts for all sorts of things. Because Temple is massive, it makes it easy to move from one job to another as you grow in your career. If you're interested in a career shift, you can do so within the university. The people on the ground at the university are generally phenomenal. Once working there for a while, you learn contacts and people are very open to providing inter-department support and collaboration.", "cons": "Temple doesn't pay as much as other R1 schools in Philly. As such there's a lot of staff turnover. It's not a well-kept secret that Temple hires new professionals in the field of student services, and those folks tend to move on. This can be frustrating when trying to maintain a list of university contacts. Tuition remission, while nice, can be severely limited. Every department can make its own rules regarding whether employees are allowed to take classes during the day. Taking this into account, your total program options become very narrow. Grad-level classes are subject to taxed income, which can be an issue when you consider that Temple pays lower than other R1 schools locally. The university is massive, so administrative decisions can be very disconnected from lower-level employee experience. This was a nightmare during the pandemic, with each department making wildly different decisions. Lack of support for professional development. Budget cuts have led many departments to slash their conference budget. They'll still pay your salary to attend, but you have to foot the travel bill. As diverse as the university is, there's still a lack of support for staff belonging to religious minority groups. This will vary across departments, of course.

Otherwise, the position is fairly straightforward and you have tons of resources/testing manuals at your disposal to help you, so really most of the work is independent. Some days can be quite busy, but on other days you'll have time to complete school work, which is a plus. If you're not busy with testing, sometimes supervisors will assign extra administrative tasks - this is a great way to get general administrative experience in general.\r\n\r\nAlso, another fantastic reason to work for the testing center is that you're paid separately by testing companies if you work over the weekend. Normally pay is quite good for these extra exams if you can fit them in your schedule (it's not required necessarily, but most of the proctors expect and want to work the occasional weekend)!", "cons": "Sometimes testing can be chaotic - this is just part of being a test proctor, though, and not unique to Temple's testing center. A good deal of your work is done alone - which can be nice if it's a slow testing day - but stressful and overwhelming if you have a line out the door and can hardly catch a break. \r\n\r\nAlso, there is little opportunity to advance from this position. I knew some coworkers who had this position for many years but still never got a salary raise or promotion to a different position within the center. Opportunities to get a full time position in the testing company do come up (rarely), but for the most part this is ideally a job for a grad student or retiree who just wants to work part time."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Lab Consultant in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to know people at work", "cons": "Sometimes people who you interact, outside of coworkers ,could be disrespectful"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great student job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Community Technician in Philadelphia, PA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They work with your schedule but make sure you are held to your responsibilities.
