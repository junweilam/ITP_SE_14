If you're looking at a faculty position, you will likely find that the pay is more in line with industry trends and other Big Ten institutions. It's incredibly difficult to get a job here without a minimum of a master's degree, but your salary will likely not align with your education. The issue of pay for staff members has been brought up to leadership before and they state that they realize staff are under paid, but that this is a trend nationwide so there is an overall acceptance to normalize underpaying employees. In addition, it can be challenging to advance since campus has lots of people with PhDs. There is an assumption that people with PhDs are automatically leaders and this is very rarely true since PhDs are typically focused on research, not leadership. As a result, jobs that would typically require a bachelor's degree (master's at a maximum) end up going to people with PhDs. In addition, despite a multiyear, multimillion dollar effort, title and pay across campus lacks equity. In one program, an employee may be called a Director, but a person in another program who does the exact same work could be called an Advisor or a Specialist. Raises are also almost entirely non-existent so the only way to really advance in position and/or pay is to move into new roles, which can be tricky because of the issue(s) previously indicated. Sadly, there is truly no benefit to doing your job well year after year in the same position since this will ultimately stunt any type of economic mobility."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Look elsewhere if you want to be recognized for your work and receive raises.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Clinical Research Coordinator II in Madison, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The benefits are pretty good.", "cons": "Impossible to get a raise unless mandated by the state or you get a new job."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "UW Small Animal Hospital", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Rotating Intern in Madison, WI", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great tertiary facility with access to various specialists on a daily basis.

Merit raises are rare if they are given out at all depending the area you work for.

Getting a new position is a more effective way of getting a raise.\r\n\u2022 Turnover is VERY high in some areas and is usually a sign of poor management or unmet employee needs. Often, areas state being understaffed is the source of their problems and that filling the empty seats will solve everything - ignoring WHY people are leaving. If interviewing with a department and there is high turnover, ask them why the turnover is happening and what their long-term plans are for addressing this. Ask them what their plans for training are if the dept is short-staffed. Do NOT ignore this red flag.\r\n\u2022 The \"Peter Principle\" is notable. \"Management\" is not seen as a separate skill and these positions are often given to individuals who are skilled in their area but not with running operations or managing people.\r\n\u2022 Many departments are still majority (non-remote) on-site work and will not consider remote even if they are not customer-facing or student-teaching positions requiring in-person work. \r\n\u2022 Some areas did not adjust to covid-era needs well. Some are not-remote not because the work itself requires the employee to be on-site, but because management does not have the skills to communicate and coordinate with a remote workforce. Campus switched their financial processes to a largely online system, a change has been resisted by some.\r\n\u2022Parking on campus is expensive.\r\n\u2022 Regarding diversity, the campus makes notable steps toward addressing visible diversity, but neurodiversity and less visible disabilities are very under-addressed, varying by dept.

The hours are long.

(Also, the average is not 20 hours a week, it is more. It is a common concern.) \r\n\r\nUndergraduate TAs are treated way better as they get paid by the hour instead of a salary. Professors for budget reasons are careful how much work they assign to undergraduate TAs. Some professors are mindful of the hours the graduate TAs put in and don't abuse their TAs, but I don't believe it is the norm. Keep in mind long hours seven days a week is the norm for academia, so most professors do not consider what they put graduate TAs through to be abuse. Most professors are genuinely positive people. It is the system, and like fish in the sea they no longer are very aware of the water they swim in. They are adapted to it.\r\n\r\nI suggest getting a MS degree, not a Ph.D. and not being a TA, unless you aspire to be a professor. This way one graduates sooner and can start earning real money.

There is a large outdoor culture in Madison that permeates the university, and most of the student body seems to like being out and about. There is a strong culture at UW based around the lakes, especially concentrated around memorial terrace (it even serves beer!) This makes finding common events and spaces easy. \r\n\r\n I've always had good (though limited) interactions with administration. The libraries are well stocked, and I have rarely not been able to find a research article I've needed in some form or another. New research facilities at the hospital have revitalized many labs on campus, pulling them out of basements in brick buildings. UW-Madison also boasts many helpful resources when it comes to entrepreneurship and patent law in the form of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). The Wisconsin Idea means that the university is heavily involved in the surrounding area. University presence in the form of education and research is easy to see and easy to get involved in.", "cons": "Drinking culture is a large part of Wisconsin, and the university is no exception.

At DCS and on campus there is relatively high turnover and a lot of folks moving around internally (this can be one of the only ways to get a promotion/pay raise, in this era of lean budgets around campus). DCS is hiring extremely rapidly without a lot of clear direction and I don't think enough care is being taken to be strategic with this growth. It seems like historically there's been tension between units in DCS that are doing more traditional continuing studies type work (noncredit, adult learners, professional development, etc.) and those working on the more entrepreneurial/for-credit programs, and upper leadership isn't very sensitive about this divide.
