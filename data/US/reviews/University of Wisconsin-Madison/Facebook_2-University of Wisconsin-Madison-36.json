The biggest issue is that scientific staff are treated like garbage by the University as a whole, and the salary you will receive is commensurate with that.

The university seems to want to invest in administrators and office staff, and pay them twice what the scientists and researchers make, even though the science staff are the ones working long hours to bring money back to the university in the way of grants. What is worse is that the chancellor, numerous deans and execs seem to be proponents of this model, that way they can continue to justify to the state why they need more state funding. Since 99% of science staff are paid from fed grants, it only makes sense to double the salaries of those paid from state funds.\r\n\r\nThey are implementing a new HR system going on 4 years now, which will further increase the inequity between the doers ( scientists), and the takers(office staff). Most of us can't wait for that.  Science staff have zero representation, unless you consider a secretary or dept administrator with a degree in email sending \"representation\". There is zero transparency here. If you want a raise, or promotion, good luck. HR has made sure to hide what it wants, so that fewer people can get raises/promotions, unless of course you are in HR and administration, then you know how to do it and are assured a good raise every year. \r\n\r\nWhere else outside a major metro area can you be charge 1K a year to park 3 blocks from work? \r\n\r\nIt is a major academic institution, so obviously there are ZERO education benefits.
