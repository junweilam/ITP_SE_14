Illinois Tech does not provide adequate support to its Ph.D. researchers, such as funding, equipment, or access to necessary research instruments, which makes Ph.D. research much more difficult and frustrating. There is no communication.

The insurance has gone up about 20-25% for each of the past three years, and administrative fees by 5% annually. In 2016 I gave back $3000 of that stipend. My experience suggests you will continue to give back more each year; so as your workload increases, your financial resources shrink.
