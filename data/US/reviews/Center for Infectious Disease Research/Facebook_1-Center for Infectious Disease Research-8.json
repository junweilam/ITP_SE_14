Basic and translational research exist side-by-side at the institute, and different labs work on vaccine development for these diseases.  I interacted with and knew many of the staff here, whether IT, facilities or EH&S, everyone is really helpful and professional.  Booking the shared equipment is easy, and although sometimes heavily used, the facilities staff are very helpful training scientists and resolve any problems.  The building is about 10 years old and many of the labs are really well equipped, particularly the BSL-3 facilities. Importantly, there are lots of seminars from the best researchers in the World, and I saw many of the scientists in my field speak, without having to travel.  Opportunities for collaborations exist, but it depends on the PIs, but researchers are generally helpful and this supports peer-to-peer knowledge transfer.  There are also regular social events on and off site which are aimed at building a team atmosphere.  The systems biology approach to infectious disease research seems to be paying off, now $16 million funding has been awarded for a new project.  Professional development events have been growing in recent years, and there is more support from above for such events.  Finally, the BioQuest academy introduces high-school kids to real research - and any scientist can get involved in these programs should they wish - a truly exceptional experience for teenagers interested in science as well as scientists interested in education.", "cons": "Apart from the big 3 infectious diseases described above, less research is dedicated to the Neglected Tropical Diseases, and in the next 5-10 years, the number of these labs will undoubtedly shrink.  Also, a lot of the shared equipment is old and needs more investment, with the exception of the flow cytometry core.  Despite all the positives, the research scientists and staff seem undervalued and given recent funding problems due to sequestration, numerous people have been treated rather poorly before being let go.  This is undoubtedly a result of the contracts for researchers, with no set duration, and a degree of dishonesty about the financial health of labs, so researchers can come from the other side of the World to find 6 months later that funding is not sufficient to keep them, and cannot achieve anything publishable.  Also there seems to be next to no mentoring of research scientists by PIs in almost any lab I can think of, this can make it very difficult for new researchers to develop to the next stage in their career.  Finally, although social events are good for morale, ultimately they do not make researchers happy, if they do not have time to go to to them - I usually felt pressured with work and stayed late in the lab instead."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Seems to be getting better", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Sept 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Seattle, WA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The smart and talented people that work here.
