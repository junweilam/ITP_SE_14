So use all your PTO, now you can\u2019t take time off so you get burnt out. Use all your PTO and if you don\u2019t have any then tough luck on getting paid for having COVID of all things! If a pandemic illness isn\u2019t a good enough reason for employees to be able to use their sick time, then I don\u2019t know what is. That\u2019s the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever heard of, and frankly, what\u2019s the point in anyone even taking precautions of COVID if they know they\u2019re getting screwed on paying bills if they can\u2019t even use sick time for testing positive on such a MAJOR virus? What is wrong with this picture, Erlanger????!!!! 80% of all other businesses will pay, cover, or allow employees to use sick time if they have a positive COVID test, yet a hospital whose employees put themselves at risk for COVID every day can\u2019t use sick time if they end up getting COVID."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance":

They have pulled the rug out from the staff and retirees because of \"too little profit\" only to give that money in the form of huge bonuses to upper management. So obviously, moral is not good. Management literally *times* how long it takes you to do certain things, from housekeeping on up and you then have to document why it took you longer if you miss by a few minutes. Because we all know there are never any interruptions/ snark.  \r\nI worked as an RN for a couple of decades there, btw. At one time I was proud to work there. Now they treat the staff like numbers, expect you to do the job of 3 people and not make mistakes, and the system for charting and giving drugs, etc is the most incompetent program I've ever seen or dealt with. \r\nManagement most assuredly finds ways to get rid of the staff that have been there the longest, especially when they still paid a small pension (which they don't anymore.) Those RN's who are higher on the pay scale will be replaced with a new grad gleefully.  For example, if you are out sick/call in more than 4 times in 2, yes 2 years, you are fired. Nurses are expected to be PCT's, secretaries as well. I am certainly ready to help with anything, even housekeeping if my work is done. My point is they won't hire enough staff to keep the unit, equipment, and patients clean,  but anytime there is an infection, it's because the nurse didn't wash their hands. They actually have spies to watch you as you go in and out of rooms. But no one goes in and sees you wash your hands in front of the patient, so you get dinged for not using that horrible skin splitting alcohol rub from the bottle outside the room.  \r\nWe had some PRN nurses who also travelled, worked strikes, worked places like Grady in ATL, hospitals similar in NYC, LA, Philly... while on strike! and said it wasn't as hard as working at Erlanger. If you can work here, you can work anywhere, so don't let them take your confidence away when they tell you what a bad job you do. That's how they keep the staff that don't move on.
