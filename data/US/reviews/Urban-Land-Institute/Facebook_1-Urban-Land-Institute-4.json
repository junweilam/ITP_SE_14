Lots of tugging back and forth at the top level that leaves the rest of us wondering what we're supposed to be doing and where the organization is heading. Many don't feel comfortable or safe expressing this to management. \r\n\r\nManagement only seems to care about the 1% of members who are the most wealthy and will give back to ULI through the annual fund. They are called \"Key Leaders,\" and it's sickening to watch how much they control what we do as an organization. \r\n\r\nThe turnover is picking up at alarming rate (from junior level all the way to the president). \r\n\r\nIt's a nonprofit, so pay is not great. But it gets worse when you realize that good performance does not equal more pay. So far, everyone gets the same small raise every year, so make sure you negotiate when you are hired.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to do entirely too much with the amount of staff that we have. Everyone is spread so thin that there is a clear \"quantity over quality\" culture throughout. \r\n\r\nDefinite silo-ing happening between DC HQ staff and all the rest of the great District Council staff, who honestly have more insight into what our members actually want."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Special Events Coordinator Intern", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Intern in Timonium, MD", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Awesome environment and mentors.
