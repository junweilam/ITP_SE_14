Friendly and professional.  They are willing to help you and speak up for you.  Because of this, many employees are fiercely loyal to their surgeons.  New employees may have problems getting \"in\".\r\n\r\nPaid parking.  Rare in the Medical Center.\r\n\r\nHelpful and friendly staff.  I receive more support from coworkers than management.\r\n\r\nSmaller hospital; you get to know everyone.\r\n\r\nMain surgery has an RN OR training program.  It is designed to help train new nurses into the orthopedic OR.  This was done in response to an inability to hire experienced nurses.  This is a great Pro because surgery is not taught in schools and the experienced nurses are retiring...or going elsewhere for better pay.  A certificate is issued after so many months.\r\n\r\nNext to St. Nicholas private school, although it is expensive.  It is planning to move in a couple of years.  It cares for babies up to 9th grade.\r\n\r\nStarting to hire 10-hr shift people; this helps the call crew from working too late, too much.\r\n\r\nOvertime is offered almost daily and is encouraged.  Looks good at evaluation time.  This is a con if you don't want overtime.\r\n\r\nFree Holiday meals, although the quality changes frequently; it is outsourced.\r\n\r\nTry their best to offer 30-minute lunches.  If it's not possible, management buys pizzas or sandwiches and offers 15-minute breaks.  It's a con if you're trying to eat healthy!  \r\n\r\nNice yearly company party held on Saturday every late January or early February at a hotel.  Buffet food and gambling (for prizes).\r\n\r\nOutside the Medical Center, so most of the traffic in the area is avoided.\r\n\r\nNew 5th floor offers a Starbucks coffee shop with a view.  They also serve simple sandwiches.  Open from 6am - 6pm.", "cons": "Lower than average pay for area.  For techs, usually $5/hr less than the bigger hospitals nearby, despite what HR says.  Benefits not as good either.  No sick pay.\r\n\r\nLow or no bonuses offered.  Usually $25 gift card every Thanksgiving, Christmas and Birthday.  75$ quarterly gift cards if certain quality measures are met, usually reached only once a year.  Bonuses are taxed.  Quality measures are increased if bonus is met.  Must be full time to receive bonuses.\r\n\r\nIt is partially owned by HCA, formally known as Colombia Hospitals.  This may be a pro or con depending on your experience with them.\r\n\r\nHR waits until they can't hire anyone before they give everyone a raise or adjustments.  In 2015, nurses received a large salary adjustment because of that.\r\n\r\nLack transparency.  Big time gossip mill, yet it's the only way to get information while avoiding the intimidating director.  Management does nothing to manage the gossip.\r\n\r\nPolicy discourages discussion of salary and bonuses that you must sign prior to employment.  Never sure if you are being paid fairly.\r\n\r\nDifficult to get vacation time off; must plan several months ahead of time.  Director discourages making plans over 6 months to be fair for everyone.  However, people in general try their best to work vacation time in.\r\n\r\nStrict and strange rules on absenteeism.  Measured on a point system.  If you are late (1 minute or 2 hours), it's a point.  If you have to leave early (within 4 hours), it's 1.5 points.  If you call in sick within 4 hours or less for your shift, it's 2 points.  Verbal warning after 4 points, written warning after 6 points, firing happens after 7? points.  Points reset every year.  Don't get sick!  Management MAY sympathize if there is flooding/natrual disaster going on.\r\n\r\nUnusual call system.  Do not get paid for simply holding a beeper.  Call bonuses ($50 for surgical techs, more for nurses) are given after you work your 8 hours.  So, you don't get a call bonus if you get called in on your day off (which sometimes happens), however you can get a call bonus for having to drive in to work.  Yeah, confusing.  Must make a written request and have it signed by a manager to receive call bonuses every time.\r\n\r\nCall can last well into the night.  Must work normal shift the following day, although management trys to work in a leave-early request if you want to.\r\n\r\nNo sick leave/time off.  Must use PTO, expecially if you've worked less than 30 hours that week.  Don't get sick!\r\n\r\nMandatory call 3-5 days a month, depending on which department you work in.  Call is a necessary evil.  In general, surgical techs take more call than nurses.  Outpatient surgery department takes more call than Main Surgery becasue Outpatient is smaller.  Outpatient surgery is expected to cover for Main Surgery if short staffed, it rarely works the other way around because Main Surgery has the longer and more difficult cases.  Usually stay late 1-3 hours past your shift when on call. Main surgery department is expected to take weekend call, which includes Friday through Sunday; luckily, there are crew teams that prefers weekend call. Holiday call is rotated and includes both Outpatient and Main surgery departments.  Rarely called back in after working your shift.\r\n\r\nFavortism.  Brown-nosing PAYS.  It will help you with general flexibility in work and getting your ideas heard (unpopular employees that have excellent ideas or valid concerns are dissmissed).  If this doesn't bother you and can work this system, then this is a great Pro.  \r\n\r\nLack of leadership at the management level\r\n\r\nUnprofessional director.  Has yelled at people, made discourageing comments, belittles; very intimidating person.\r\n\r\nDifferent CEO/CFO every 2-4 years\r\n\r\nSalary caps after about 10 years of service.  \r\n\r\nLack of day care centers in area.  St. Nicholas is the only school nearby, and it's moving. \r\n\r\nWork load varies daily.  Can work overtime on one day and leave early the next.  Employees often pushed to clock out before their shift ends (except for \"favorites\").\r\n\r\nUndignified way they fire people.  Firing usually takes place on Fridays at the end of a shift.  Two security guards walk with you as you empty your locker and walk to your car.  Everyone on the way watches.  They have fired people who where employee of the year before.  They have fired pregnant women before. If they want you to go, they'll find a way.  Goes back to favortism.  \r\n\r\nHR and management have told me they are like a family; don't buy it!  It is a company like all others and should be treated as such.  When the lion is fed, he's happy, if there's something better, you're the food.  Not really a Con, just the truth...it's not your family.  Knowing this should help separate personal issues with company issues, don't mix the two.  In the end, despite what management says, TOH doesn't care about your personal problems when there's a bottom line to be met.  Those who have worked here since it opened may be shocked, because it really was once a smaller, family-like environment.  It has grown substancially since, so don't drink the kool-aid."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Medical Records HIM", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Feb 2010", "job_title": "HIM Analyst ! in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Parking is free.
