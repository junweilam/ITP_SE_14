Often management and leadership are patronizing and talk down to those they oversee. Employees in a lower pay grade are treated differently and often more harshly by both management and other employees; it's not uncommon to hear other employees mocking them. Homophobia is a problem there, and based on my experience I don't expect them to do anything about it. I also witnessed racist, sexist, and homophobic conversations between coworkers but lack of good leadership left me feeling that it was pointless to report it. We were constantly understaffed but expected to perform as if we were. It really felt like all management truly cared about was our numbers and ratings, not the actual patients. Some nurses abused their power and delegated tasks to the CNA's just so they could relax. There were many occasions were nurses spent time just to find a particular aid to delegate a task to in the time it would have taken to just do the task themselves. CNA's on my floor were frequently given busy work if the Charge Nurse saw things were slow. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the most support we ever got was a pizza party and emails of well wishes from senior leadership which felt a bit disingenuous. It took them almost a year to give us any sort of pandemic-related bonus or pay increase, but that was only if you picked up more than your boarded hours. It feels like if your not a physician or a manager there, you're just another disposable employee.
