I knew the money that the students were paying for tuition and how they truly felt a degree from DeVry was more meaningful - or just as meaningful - as a degree from another college.  Here are some of the reasons for my embarrassment:\r\n\r\nACT Scores: I dealt with a lot of the ACT scores of students who were already admitted into DeVry.  Note that I wrote \"already admitted\".  The vast majority of ACT scores that I saw were 9's or 12's for the Math category of the ACT.  When I saw a \"15\" for the math category every so often, it stood out for being \"high\".  Then, there would be students who had a \"24\" for their ACT score.  I felt bad that they were admitted just as much as those who received a \"12\".  When a school takes students with incredibly low ACT scores, that's a sure sign that it's a diploma factory.\r\n\r\nTranscripts: My advice for anyone who requests a copy of their transcript from DeVry (and especially Keller Graduate School of Management) is to look it over very carefully.  The system that produced transcripts (at least back when I was there) was notorious for having the wrong grades and cumulative gpa.  Especially for Keller transcripts, the computer would sometimes list a cumulative gpa of 0.00.  \r\n\r\nThe Terrible Trimester System: The school does a trimester system.  And then each trimester is broken into two parts: Session A and Session B.  This allows a student to cram through more classes in less time, but it's a financial nightmare.  If a student attends just one class and then drops the class, they already will already have to pay a significant amount of money.  This system also made it more confusing for employees who were trying to assist students."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Academia can take the fun out of teaching if you aren't careful.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Associate Professor in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "+ Great opportunities for teaching\r\n+ Quality processes keep the organization oriented on improvement\r\n+ A business focus on profit keeps company goals grounded and realistic, not choked by academic certifications\r\n+ Good core values that encourage teaching\r\n+ Fantastic staff and part-time faculty, hired without the arduous filters that state academic institutions require, but instead hired based on practical experience and (inadvertently) altruistic desire to teach\r\n+ Excellent opportunities to reach out to students and genuinely improve lives\r\n+ DeVry's focus on developing practical job skills is really solid, and very helpful for students, and makes me feel good to be a part of", "cons": "- Meaningless promotions for faculty members\r\n- Quality of campuses varies significantly from site to site\r\n- Disconnected administration that makes decisions on behalf of the business, not the education of students\r\n- Poor administrative support for developing faculty.

I guess this is in place so that students can put more emphasis on their class work but  I think students should be given the opportunity to work more then that if they wanted to, either that or raise the pay. $8.00/hr or $320 every two weeks (if your work the full 20/hrs) is pretty ridiculous when you have to factor in that students are on their own for transportation to and from school - this includes metro - which is costly in itself, then we're on our own for parking - $45.00 a month or $17.00 a day -  and many students that are in housing have to work multiple jobs in addition to working at Devry just to make ends meet. While we do get \"raises\" I hardly call a quarter every year a raise. Yeah, I know its temporary we're just their to work until we graduate but I don't think anyone takes into consideration how much gets done at that campus thanks to student workers. We get no benefits, if a work day falls on a holiday or a day that school is closed, we don't get paid for that day, which wouldn't be such a bummer if we didn't get paid hardly anything in the first place.

Stop saying that...how many times are we changing alpha splits for students!!!! Our students are sick and tried of having a new SFC's or SSA's every 4 months - due to the constant changes that DeVry makes up. I have been with DeVry for 7 years now and each year, the changes are focusing more to the \"growth of income to the organization\". You have to understand...this is a \"business acting like a school\". If DeVry was so centered to \"Student Care Model\" - then lower the cost of tuition.....give me a break, 1 unit here is $609.00, higher than any state school. And I think to my self, we are charging so much money for an education that has no guarantee unless students are enrolling in certain program. \r\n\r\nSSA/SFC are so overworked, its crazy. A lot of Advisors are great people with financial, counseling and customer service backgrounds. The financial team will be given daily reports, which are expected to be completed by the end of the day. Clearing continuing students and all their verification items, new students meeting and presentations, company meetings and CASES - that never stop from flooding our daily task box. And we are suppose to do ALL this...everyday. NOT JOKE. \r\n\r\nAt the end of each session, we are told, \" Why didn't we help more students out?\" - Are you kidding me? Let focus on the students, not pointless reports that have no meaning unless you ARE with management and need a reason for cause to the decline in enrollment. \r\n\r\nThe decline in enrollment is simple....DeVry needs to be more selective!!! At this point, anyone that can open the door is \" accepted\". The finance team has to deal with reject students, pass student that can't even pass \"basic\" courses and don't forget VA students - that should never be allowed to attend a PRIVATE university environment. Most VA students that come to DeVry have been passed through the system....3 to 5 times from different schools. VA students are aware of the Satisfactory Academic Process at DeVry. VA students are coming to school and failing for 3 semesters and then moving on. With housing allowance that ranges in the thousands!!! These students are destroying the school credibility and academic standards. DeVry should not put up with this stuff....VA students should be given 1 semester,  to prove their enrollment. For every 10 VA students 5 will withdrawal or be dismissed. \r\n\r\nAdmission advisor are paid to \"LIE\", I have a front row seat to the misguided, holding back and ballooning of certain aspects to the admission process. Admission advisors will call students..over and over again. Until they are sick of the non-stop method, just to achieve another weekly goal. Most Admission advisors - don't care about the student, once they have cleared week 2. Because, once they have cleared the  \"recorded\" period....admissions is done and on to the next on. Back in the day of the DeVry Golden period - advisors were paid up to $100 to $500 a students. Certain advisors had a \"car salesman\" platform of selling...In 2000, this method of compensation stop....due to certain regulator conditions and rules. Profit school...what can you say. To the present day, Advisors come and go.....the one's that stay have no other alternative or they are close to retiring...so they don't care. Seeing a student for a 30 minute meeting, doesn't prove anything.....but the real impact of these \"open door students\" always goes to Student Central and the SSA/SFC must FIX the problems that Admission care not to focus on....\r\n\r\nFocus on the students and not the end of year income statement, which UNBALANCE predictions of cost  saving and retention....DeVry method of transitional change is letting go of employees.\r\n\r\nI can guarantee this for the coming years, DeVry will find a way to move all finance/ advising to online. So that way, the new model will transform cost saving locations into 1...and location will be used as just an admission hub. The interaction of student to advisor has change. I'm seeing it already with our new virtual communication system - Bluejeans. No need to see an advisor at a Home Location. The advisor will come to you. That will save a few dollars huh? Moving to a online platform for full access of the income generated flow of an organization, that is finding there true meaning...just like the housing bubble, this will be next."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Work environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Admissions Representative in Naperville, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Laid back, the pay is great, and there is room for growth and becoming management.

One of the directors use to be a car sales man manager, like really how is car selling related to anything to higher education? That is until you notice DeVry only cares about signing up students and nothing more, the school is not even highly ranked and cost per credit is super high i went ot a top 10 school and paid a fraction of what a semester at devry would be. Back to the role you are on the floor and are given a cubical on a floor with dozens and dozens other workers like you, you are to go into a dialer and make anywhere from 100-150 dials to meet your numbers, your call with a student should be one hour long and you get yelled at from your boss if its not one hour long, they give you a script to go over with to every student if you go aside from the script the mangers will listen to your calls and tell you \"stick to the script\"which is right from the scene from the movie \"sorry to bother you\". No life balance at all one day a week you have a late night 1 and have to work 1 Saturday a month. During end of the 8th week they want everyone to work over time. When i was hired i started with a class of 7 people by the time i left in less than a year everyone already quit. Turn over rate is high by the time you remember someone they are gone the next day. Going back to managers not caring , the manger just recently let go of one of my old co-workers for not meeting there numbers and to make it worst they didnt have the guts to tell them they were going to be let go. Of course they couldnt say they are letting them go for not hitting there numbers since that would be illegal they made up some other reason to let them go. Back when Devry started people use to make commission on the students they signed up but they had to stop for legal reasons that is sad.
