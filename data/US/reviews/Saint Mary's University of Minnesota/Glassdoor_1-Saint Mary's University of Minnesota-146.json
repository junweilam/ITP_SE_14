Encountered many caring people during my time there.\n- Since it's a Catholic school, there are lots of paid holidays off and good sick time accrual (although comparably less vacation days)", "cons": "Like a lot of smaller, less-prestigious schools, SMUMN has been hit hard by the pandemic -- especially the Winona campus, which the school still insists on investing a lot more money into at the expense of the Twin Cities campus. However, Winona's been losing money/enrollment for many years, and administration's approach was to keep doing the same things and wonder why they weren't working, while getting increasingly more desperate. As others have mentioned, I think this is really catching up to them right now, and I honestly can't see a sustainable future for SMUMN if things keep going as they have been.\n\nMany of the adult students in Minneapolis are attracted by the comparably lower tuition, but then are faced with minimal support -- overworked adjuncts and student services, no spare laptops, no mental health services, expensive textbooks (a problem everywhere, but the bookstore is run by Barnes & Noble, which exacerbates the issue here). The admin constantly changes up the approach, tanking programs after a year or two without doing evidence-based assessments of WHY programs weren't attracting students. Overall, the program development and \"strategy\" can feel borderline predatory, very oriented toward a vague sense of the market while not being backed by real research or needs assessment.\n\nAdministration doesn't particularly respect or support the majority of people on the campus, especially admin/support staff, adjunct faculty (the bulk of faculty in Minneapolis), etc. As others have mentioned, there's lot of back-patting among the admin, betrayed by low morale, regular turnover, and much lower pay than average.\n\nThe pension is only vested if you work there for 5+ years, so I imagine they don't wind up having to pay it out for most people!\n\nI appreciated the Lasallian values when I started, but it's clear that the administration doesn't really live those out in practice. The administration is conservative and fearful of change, especially when it comes to true inclusivity and diversity (vs. outdated lip service). While living through both the pandemic and the uprising in Minneapolis (and the world!), it was really disappointing to see the administration doubling down on backwards and outdated ideologies. It's 2022, and their approach is incredibly alienating for a ton of students and staff. Hiring a diversity & inclusion specialist (years too late!) doesn't mitigate the larger structural issues.\n\nCampus buildings in Minneapolis are outdated, not accessibility-friendly, and have terrible WiFi (which made it extra challenging for students to come to campus to study).\n\nPublic health measures dwindled after the early days of the pandemic. There was a push to get back to campus for optics' sake without a real interrogation of why that was needed and why it might have been better for morale to support WFH options -- especially since SMUMN, with so many adult and online students, might have been well-positioned to innovate in this area.
