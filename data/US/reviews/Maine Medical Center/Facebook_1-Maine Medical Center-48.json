You just feel like you have to bite your tongue. \r\n\r\nThere is no advancement in this position like a CNA where you can have two to three positions. There is basically a dispatcher but that is it. \r\n\r\nYou end up having to take patients down for procedures two feet down the hallway when the nurse is also going down and could have taken the patient themselves. Makes us feel like a luxury service instead of a necessity.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely no information on what the patient is going through and the ticket to ride will sometimes have: \u201cNo Principle Problem\u201d so if the patient is in pain you don\u2019t know what is wrong and can\u2019t do anything to help them\r\n\r\nThere can be a lot of fellow transporters who don\u2019t know your limitations and will not put in for a third person when dealing with a bariatric patient in a bed or there will be no prioritizing when an able and fit nurse is accompanying the bed and the transporters will throw in for another transporter to help with transporting the bed while the nurse just runs beside the bed like we are in a marathon. Absolutely in this case barely any prioritizing when there are a ton of jobs pending.\r\n\r\nThey keep building extra sections on the hospital and think that we should be able to accommodate their equipment needs. \r\n\r\nStaff on receiving ends of units who are expecting patients to be picked up or dropped off are constantly phoning our tiny dispatch office and complaining about the wait time. We are only human and can only do so much.\r\n\r\nWe had no raise in pay when they added two huge additional floors to the hospital which have increased our transport threefold\r\n\r\nNurses have NOT been canceling jobs when they get too \u201ctired of waiting\u201d for us to grab their patients and when we actually GET up there after traveling a trillion miles to get to their unit with the job they SHOULD have canceled we find out it was never canceled and we end up wasting time on a wild goose chase when we could have been helping another patient in need.\r\n\r\nWhen patients are being discharged nurses won\u2019t go into their rooms and take meds off the iv poles so we will have a whole room FULL of iv poles with meds which we can\u2019t remove and then when they feel up to removing the meds the soiled utility rooms are too full and our clean-outs are now even more stressful\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of communication between shifts and their leads on rules and after working one year during one shift and another year in another shift I can\u2019t tell what we should or shouldn\u2019t be doing\r\n\r\nSome staff think they can just shove their way into an elevator when we have a strict patient- transport per elevator rule which the whole hospital is aware of. They don\u2019t care and when you get a stare by them at your badge like they want to clarify what your position is and who you think you are talking to it makes you feel like you are worthless\r\n\r\nStaff won\u2019t give clear hand offs to what mode of transportation a patient is going up on and when you get up there you have to express the whole \u201cdon\u2019t shoot the messenger\u201d lingo. And when you see a patient is walking around and then the staff says they have to go in their bed somewhere and could have easily gone in a stretcher you have more stress put on you because now you have to wait for another transporter. \r\n\r\nYou are made to take CPR classes when you can\u2019t even perform it on a patient because you can\u2019t touch the patient or alter their physical status because during cpr you run the risk of cracking ribs\r\n\r\nYou can\u2019t switch oxygen tanks or wear dro gowns and go into a dro room even though you were trained on it in another previous job\r\n\r\nThere are other things that I am probably missing, but transport is not appreciated enough for all that we do. We take patients to and from their procedures, discharge them and take them to the pharmacy and then wait in the cold sometimes for their cars to pick them up, we do morgue runs, we clean out the hospital of dirty equipment, we take equipment all over the hospital for deliveries, we pick up other equipment that we don\u2019t supply and take them places, we do lab rounds every hour, at night we also do all the janitorial duties too. We deserve so much more respect and are just as valuable as nurses are.
