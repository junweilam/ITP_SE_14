The ER Director (who has since retired) would always tell us when one works everyone works & when one sits everyone sits. Unfortunately since her retirement things have really fallen by the wayside.  Almost all of the good nurses that worked there have moved on to other ventures due to poor work conditions and management's constantly trying  to find reasons to write everyone up or messing up schedules or being over stressed. They are being replaced with nurses that would much rather be texting or Facebooking from there desk then be bothered with patient care. The whole system has become a situation in which all the grunt work gets dumped on to the paramedics. The only thing that paramedics are not tasked with doing is administering medications.\n\nWork conditions are not safe. We constantly had stretchers that did not work properly. The stretchers stear mode did not work causing the stretchers to swing left or right freely leaving us unable to control them safely. A couple of times I tried to compensate for it until I felt the strain on my back. When this was reported to management nothing was done.  A work order would be written up and the stretcher would have a \"down tag\" put on it. A week later the stretcher would be right back in use without being fixed. I suggested to management to assign an identification number to the stretcher so we could make sure the repairs were completed. They ignored the suggestion. The side rail to several stretchers would not lock in position which is potentially dangerous for the patient, leaving the hospital and staff members liable for potential injuries to the patients whom we were supposed to be caring for. When reported nothing was done. Necessary pieces of the bed like IV poles were broken and never repaired. This one in particular is true not only of the stretchers in the ER but also of the beds in the main hospital.  Mattresses that were bought and applied to the stretches were extremely grippy and made it very difficult to  slide patients from the stretcher to the bed. Yet again management ignored the problem and continued using the matresses.\n\nIt must sound like I complained all the time. These are just the facts and only a few of the items I could think to mention. I like many others that worked there would get called into the office because of anonymous complaint from other staff members.  When I expressed my displeasure with other staff members (without naming individuals) they began asking for names and situations. That is when I realized they were more interested in writing up people up and not solving problems. Truth is that leadership or lack of it is the real issue."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Some ups and some downs", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Boca Raton, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, nice hours, opportunity for overtime, no need to clock out for lunch, quick and generous accrual of PTO.", "cons": "Parking.
