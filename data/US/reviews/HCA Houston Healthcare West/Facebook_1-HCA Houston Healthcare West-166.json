It's easy to get lost because it's a Y-shaped building with many others connected to it piecemeal and the hallways are the same color. But once you get the hang of it, you can get around easier.\r\n- There is a community feel to it. Everyone is friendly with everybody and the staff will literally greet anyone -may the person be another employee or a guest- that passes them by. \r\n\r\n- If you want 40 hour shifts, you will get it. There are a lot of different shifts and your manager will work around what you do best. I am fastest in preparing the hot plate and also the cold food prep so I switched around those positions.\r\n\r\n- Diverse kitchen staff. You will learn a lot of different cultures here.\r\n\r\n- Free meals. Hospital food, yes, but at least free. Rather tasty too!\r\n\r\n- Benefits are great\u2026 if you're Full-Time. (I'll get back to this later.)", "cons": "COMMUNICATION:\r\n- HORRIBLE communication within the department staff. You call in sick and the person on the other line wouldn't pass the message to your director. Many have been fired for a \"No-Call, No-Show\" and even with phone records of their conversation with the other line, it does NOT matter. And if you're going to be late, make sure you talk to the supervisor personally or call their phones. The message will not get through unless your supervisor actually hears it.\r\n-  Employees of the department pass messages like it's a Telephone Game (one person whispers a story to the second, so on and so forth until the last person tells a completely different story) and patients often either miss out on meals or get the wrong order.\r\n- HIGHLY disorganized schedules. You can have the printed schedule in your hands and come in to work with a VERY different schedule on the wall. You may NOT informed of the shift change until you get there and you are given a good talking to for not knowing your schedule changed. VERY annoying when you had your day off when someone changed the schedule and you were not present to see that. STILL you get blamed. Just because.\r\n\r\nSHIFTS: \r\n- You can only be given FT or PT status on the discretion of the department head. Has nothing to do with seniority either. Even if you work 40+ hours a week, you will remain PRN if you do not work an AM/PM shift (as in you don't come in at morning and leave in the afternoon).\r\n- Shifts can be long when you're ordered (not asked) to do a double. you can come in at 5 am and leave at 9pm at night because someone couldn't come it. Doesn't matter if you're also working the next day and you haven't had a day off in a month. You are MANDATED.\r\n- There are no unions here. NO ONE will fight for your rights. If you slipped on the floor, your fault. There is also NO WORKMAN'S COMP either.\r\n- The shifts require physical prowess. You literally have to be RUNNING to deliver your trays. 15 minutes delivery time for 12-15 trays. That's ONE minute per patient. And you have to set the table for them (it's rarely tidy!), check that the ID bracelets match your tray, tell them about the menu and kitchen hours and make sure they have the kitchen's number on the wall. IF there is a problem like a missing dessert or if the patient doesn't like what you brought, you're pretty much in trouble with your delivery time. Even if it's not your fault (the clerk really should be blamed sometimes), your supervisor doesn't care. It's your fault no matter what. It's your fault for breathing, period.\r\n\r\n- If you get an overuse injury, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. Get a steroid shot and be quiet. You will not be given an \"easier\" job ex. clerical. NOPE NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. That's pretty much what I've been told when I got 1.) a stress fracture, 2.) bunions, and, 3.) gout on my left foot from working three weeks straight at 10 hours on some days (and NO, no overtime either). Manager was at least sympathetic because her father has gout. Supervisor? Nope, vanilla expression. Didn't even wink and just asked what took me so long to deliver a tray to the other side of the hospital. That even though I can't run, I  should've walked faster.\r\n- There is no ACCOUNTABILITY, as mentioned above. Dishonest kitchen employees that blame everyone but their own selves for their own mishaps. As mentioned above, it's just impossible for you to do all those steps for the patient and be out of the room in less than a minute. I've caught a few employees just delivering trays and not educating the patient about their meal options. I HIGHLY DOUBT they even check the ID bracelets!\r\nSometimes, the employees even leave the tray inside the room without the patient being present. This is a SAFETY ISSUE that is rarely addressed. And when you do address it, it falls on deaf ears on the management level. THIS IS NOT RIGHT! THIS IS PATIENT SAFETY!  There are semi-private (doubles) room here and had my coworkers given PatientA's food to PatientB when B isn't supposed to be eating\u2026 OH YEAH, THAT DID HAPPEN! The nurses reported it to the manager\u2026 and whoever delivered it wrong wasn't even punished! Instead, she gave everyone else including me (who was on vacation during the incident) a good talking to.\r\n\r\n- FAVORITISM. Sheer favoritism. If you're on a shift with someone your supervisor favors, odds are that you will do double duty. The Favorite could be snacking or listening on her headphones (both of which are prohibited inside the kitchen to begin with) while you're working your tail off, but if your supervisor sees that Favorite's chores for the day isn't done and you're nearest to it\u2026 rest assured YOU will have to do it on top of what your own chores are.\r\nAND\u2026 if you complain about it, YOU will be yelled at.\r\n- An incident happened where a coworker decided to make a mockery of me by pulling the cart full of dirty pans away from me while I struggled to carry and place another heavy pile of tray on top of it. The supervisor saw my coworker smiling and giggling about it\u2026 but when I got mad because 1.) supervisor saw it and didn't do a thing about it 2.) the supervisor egged me on throughout the whole shift about how I am acting like a child for being too \"sensitive\"\u2026 and yet I was the one who was threatened to be pulled out of the kitchen by security when I trying to explain my side. EMPHASIS ON TRYING. She shut me down and listened to her FAVORITE. Then I overheard them whispering to each other that she will have me written up either way. I wasn't but I don't appreciate the way I was treated at all.\r\n\r\n- Downside to diversity: I feel like I'm part of the bomb squad. At night, I'm probably one of the few employees who has the English skills and accent of someone who was born here (I wasn't). So that the barely English-speakers doesn't further cause patient dissatisfaction, I am the one sent up to the patient room to apologize for any mishaps regarding wrong meal type or snacks or even sometimes a badly prepared meal. Often the clerk would really annoy the patient through the phone and I am sent up to apologize. Obviously I didn't do anything wrong, and yet I bear the grunt of the \"anger\" because naturally the patient thinks of the department as a whole entity. It becomes way too personal sometimes, but I often try my best -with no training whatsoever- to assess AND ameliorate the situation. And when I fail, I get yelled by the supervisor when she has to go up herself to say sorry.\r\nMay I add that I am NOT a supervisor/manager? That's her job. I don't understand why *I* had to fix the problem in the first place. And I can't refuse either because I got threatened to be written up for \"misbehaving\" or \"insubordination\".\r\n\r\n- Kitchen closes at 7:00. If a patient isn't in their beds or haven't called for a tray by then, all they could have for dinner is either a frozen meal or cold sandwich. If you're the sympathetic kind, leave your heart in your locker because you will be asked to be COLD-HEARTED once in a while.\r\n\r\nSo if you can't be physically or emotionally hurt and don't mind being called many disrespectful things for minimal pay, this is the job for you. APPLY NOW!\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I advise you to stay away."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Nothing Great.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Houston, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to make your own schedule if you get to it before someonelse does", "cons": "Not very empathetic management.
