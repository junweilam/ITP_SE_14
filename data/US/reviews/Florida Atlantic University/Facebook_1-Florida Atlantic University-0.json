The campus is really nice to walk around in and has a lot of places where you can take a blanket/towel and chill or have a picnic. The gym is GREAT. Really diverse campus with people from all walks of life. They also have high schoolers there since they have a dual program for them but they for the most part don't get in the way of an university experience. The student organizations like SAVI are fun to work with. The medical and dental places have really nice professions working there too. Same with their Counseling Center. They really care about you and want to help you. There are plenty of job opportunities as a student so always look for those, especially if you live on campus. It's a nice way to help pay for classes/textbooks or other expenses. But tread carefully with your bosses/supervisors!\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of food places close by that's accessible by food. The mall is very close too. The ones higher in the hierarchy, like the provost and others, have always been fun and friendly every time I ran into them at events or on campus. The Jaffe Center is beautiful and the people working there are so passionate. Definitely check out their events and classes if you can. The department I worked for had really nice staff and the faculty for the most part were really friendly too. Can't say if that's how it is for other departments but for the most part they were nice.", "cons": "After graduating, they don't really care as much about you other than calling you for alumni donations. For example, former professors won't respond to your email and if you're asking for advice you probably won't get any. Basically if you're not a paying student, they don't really bother with you. The career centers will assist you as much as they can but I would suggest going to several of them to get a good range of advice since I've received inaccurate/bad information before but it got corrected when I saw another career advisor.  As with other universities, the academic advisors (especially for undergrad) are mostly unhelpful. I've received bad information several times and ended up taking classes I didn't need to and ended up not getting the minor I wanted. One of my friends ended up being coerced into changing her major because her advisor was focused on making her switch her major instead of helping her figure out the best course of action. The parking is horrendous as is the drive to actually get into the campus so always give yourself a lot of extra time and find different ways to enter into the campus.  Class options can be limited sometimes and they make taking classes at another college extremely difficult. For example, if you're try to be a transient student and take classes at BC because FAU doesn't offer the class at the semester you NEED to take it or because the class at BC is the same but cheaper (obviously for lower level courses) , they'll basically deny you no matter what. I think it also depends on \"who you know\" sometimes but can't say for sure obviously. Students can be very clique-y sometimes so it's harder to make friends since most people seem to want to stick with the friends they made in high school that also happens to go to FAU."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Intern - pretty good job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 May 2015", "job_title": "Psychology Research Assistant in Boca Raton, FL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people that you work with is amazing.
