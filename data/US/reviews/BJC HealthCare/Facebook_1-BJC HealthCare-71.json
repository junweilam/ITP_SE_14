There was little to no training, guidance, or support from management before being thrown into a caseload of 30+ clients with mental illness diagnoses and substance abuse struggles. As a woman straight out college, I felt underprepared and unsafe on numerous occasions- basically every day. You will drive by yourself to some of those most crime-ridden parts of St. Louis with no preparation or safe-guard measures. They reimburse you for gas, but the thousands of miles and wear and tear you will put on your vehicle driving all over St. Louis (most days anywhere from South County, to downtown, to North County driving clients around) is not worth it. In addition, you were expected to see 3-5 clients in-person a day, yet management was not expected to see clients. Management DID expect for you to see them in-person, ONLY work 8-4:30 pm (no earlier or later so they didn't have to pay you more), find time to chart every interaction, phone call (with clients, doctors, therapists, pharmacists, etc.) , and so much more while you're spending at least 3 hours everyday just driving. There was genuinely just not enough time in the day to get everything done that was unrealistically expected of you, but my manager always had time to remind me I was not doing \"everything\" I was supposed to do in a day. Not even to mention that while you're with one client, you have 10 other clients calling and texting you and screaming and cussing at you for not providing immediate service to them (and you have to chart EVERY phone call with them, even if it's them just cussing you out, which takes up just more of your time.) Most days you will basically just feel like a taxi service to them. The verbal abuse and unsafe conditions you will face in this job is absolutely, under no circumstances, worth the laughable $17.32/ hr they pay you. I couldn't afford one-bedroom rent in St. Louis and had to move back in with my parents. The only reason I left my previous, livable wage job for this one was honestly to just get further experience in the social services/psychology field before applying to PhD programs. I endured this job for 2 months before I mentally and physically could not function anymore and I quit. I now do nothing in the social services or the psychology field because this job was that detrimental to my well-being. Save yourself the mental and physical anguish.

Security is given blank checks to do whatever they want with no repercussions when things go South. Others are fighting for scraps and it absolutely impacts patient care.\r\n\r\nTech Mahindra also is treated differently by leadership. It will look bad after all if all of the bad things they do is widely known. So they get preferential treatment, often make impactful changes without letting the proper teams know and do not get burdened with root cause analysis after their changes cause major issues because leadership will not put priority 1 tickets to them. Again, it makes them look bad if they do.\r\n\r\nOverall, working with Tech Mahindra is not bad. The initial helpdesk is terrible and the turnover of their employees is brutal because their benefits are bad."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Remote Work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "10 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Lead Data Analyst in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most shared service office jobs are now fully remote.", "cons": "PTO and 401k match are not great."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Lots of Changes", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Talent Advisor in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent benefits, teammates, culture, diversity", "cons": "technology to do job, workload, always changing what we recruit for"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great fit for me", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Community Support Specialist in Saint Louis, MO", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work environment and culture", "cons": "I don\u2019t have anything to say for cons it\u2019s a great job.

We would receive emails where the meeting would be rescheduled if someone else couldn't make it, but it was never, ever on a day that I worked. One of the three nurse managers (was she the main one? Because the other two were really quiet and seemed like she ruled over them...) always had an attitude. She would comment things like \"Why don't you know this?\" (she misunderstood my question and her reaction was so hateful that I just let her rant...) or during a review of how I was feeling shortly after working I remarked \"I can't believe how helpful everyone is! It's great how people will answer any question.\" and she remarked, in a snarky way, almost under her breath \"OK, well...we told you...but OK\". I should have known then that it would go downhill very quickly. My colleague that I basically began with would rant and rave about racists and white people. She was paranoid about every single person that worked there and claimed a nurse was having people watch us...but...each time the head nurse manager spoke to her, she was grinning from ear to ear and treated her with respect. Me? No, she was rude and snarky to me. I had to deal with not being allowed at meetings, racism, and verbal abuse from a fellow MA and nurse. This was horrible. If that MA is still working there, I wouldn't suggest anyone work there. At least the nurses will leave you alone, unless you speak to them. To be clear, the clinical nurses I directly worked with were fine. It was a nurse manager and a nurse that worked in the clinic directly next to us that was horrible to me. The nurse directly next to me berated me in front of a patient and her family \"Don't you know how to do anything????\" when I refused to touch the patient who was being weighed because SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOUCHED. She grabbed the patient's wheelchair and shoved her out of the way. The nurse did a private apology later, but didn't mean it...because she made a snarky comment of \"Well, you can accept my apology or not...whatever...\" It's a fake nice place.
