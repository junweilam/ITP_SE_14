This company is doing really important work in Portland providing addictions services with withdrawal management, residential treatment, and out-patient. Their new center they moved to when they rebranded last year is really incredible, a lot of potential. I felt like I was engaged in a very meaningful job working here. I worked in the residential treatment side of the company mostly with the men's side. It was refreshing to be at a company in which I could collaborate with the leadership team in decision-making around patient care and my own workload/needs. Great team of people, a lot of kind heart-centered people. They are very generous with the amount of trainings they will reimburse for. Good deal on gym membership at 24-hour Fitness. I learned a lot working here, progressing significantly in my skills as a counselor. The pay was decent, for the type of position and experience I had, I'd say it's a little above average compared to some others I was considering when I chose to work here. This is a great place to work on your CADC, they are very supportive of that. When I was there, there weren't any clinical supervisors for my LCSW hours, but they reimbursed up to $200 for my outside supervisor which covered my sessions with that supervisor.", "cons": "Like any non-profit company I've been at, sometimes there was a bit of a disconnect from the higher level management team and people working directly with the patients, but it wasn't too bad compared to the company I was at before. It seemed like I was paying quite a bit for the health insurance I was getting, maybe a downside of being at a smaller company. This field in general has a lot of turnover unfortunately, so it would sometimes be more challenging when there were less clinicians to cover everything. There was the most turnover and lack of staff with the residential counselors, Fora could fix that if they paid the residential counselors more. More PTO would have been nice, it was definitely less than the last company I was at, but they do give a number of holidays off as well."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Move Up Quickly", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Patient Intake Coordinator in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "New facility Higher ups care about others", "cons": "Sometimes stressful Clientele can be hard to work with"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "okay for just starting out", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Detox Nurse in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good benefits, decent pay, get to help people", "cons": "very disorganized, lack of communication and consistency, higher ups seem to care more about money than actually helping people, high turnover rate for all positions"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Messy, inconsistent, & uncaring", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Residential Counselor in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexibility with your schedule, pleasant coworkers", "cons": "The schedule for anything is never correct, poor communication, low pay, poor benefits, racist, bullying & fighting happening w/management brushing off & not investigating incidents, fraudulent in the services they claim they have to the public, & no real sick pay (they take your vacation first)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work!!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "24 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Strong mission.
