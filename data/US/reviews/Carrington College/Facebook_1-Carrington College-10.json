This is a great place to gain experience in a field of interest, but be prepared to leave the company to be compensated fairly for the work that you do.  Quite a few departments encourage employees to take on additional work with hints of a future promotion; however, this promotion or compensation rarely materialize.  There is also a lot of turnover without transition planning - once people leave, historical data, processes, or even basics of what their job entails are hard to find - making future decisions difficult and leaving current employees starting at square one picking up the pieces.  Employees are often transitioned to 'interim' directors, managers, etc without receiving any sort of compensation... and interim periods can be extremely long as it takes this companyquite long, on average, to find and hire a new employee (leading to increased workloads and stress).  The promise is that this additional work will be temporary, but once it is being taken care of - finding a replacement is no longer a priority and these duties typically become yours.  This is a problem that affects almost every department and campus - have heard the complaint of being overworked from many within the system.\r\n\r\nMost discussions regarding workload, compensation, pay grade, etc are closed door with your manager, so if there is favoritism (which runs rampant within the company) your concerns are tied nearly exclusively to your manager and what they want to do or can accomplish for you.  Very political to work your way up the ladder rather than based on the job you perform.  There are many weak managers within the company that are mostly talk, saying they want to help you with your concerns, but never actually follow through.  Other managers have ridiculously high expectations while others have extremely low expectations, so your performance may be superior to a colleague's but your reviews will not reflect that.\r\n\r\nDemoralizing that lesser performing team members (or even incompetent team members) are kept on or given promotions due to favoritism or team members taking this person's duties to get the job done. \r\n\r\nGreat in the short term to gather experience and meet nice people, but don't expect to grow your career here.
