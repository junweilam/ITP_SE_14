IT recently performed some salary adjustments, but those are largely a joke\u2014in my case I received a ~12% bump, which put me right about where I should have been when I *started* in the role four years ago. Also worth noting, for anyone considering coming to UK Healthcare, future pay increases will \"merit-based\" but not in any meaningful sense.

They lack many modern tools such as GUI data tools, NLP, and even basic scripting languages (they insist that everything be done strictly with SQL queries), and when combined with a large, wide, messy database, this can be difficult to work with, and will feel odd if you have outside experience. A lot of your job will be telling people \"sorry, we can't do that\" due to the technical limitations of the organization, despite the request being perfectly reasonable.\r\n\r\nClients are difficult no matter the area, but the ignorance and entitlement of clients here is above the norm, so be prepared. There have only been a couple incidents where this got truly out of hand in my time there, but assume that you'll get an angry/pushy email at least once or twice a day, including weekends (no obligation to answer until Monday). Clients typically know nothing about data either, so you'll have to do a lot of hand holding as you guide them through creating a useful data model/format, and then adjusting it numerous times as they come back weeks later suddenly unhappy with what they've agreed to. They don't know what they want, and it will be on you to to figure out what they want as you talk them through the process.\r\n\r\nLastly, there are practically no career advancement opportunities. Once you've been trained in basic to intermediate SQL, and given what little they have of a data dictionary, don't expect to learn anything else, nor rise in rank, because there's nowhere to go. This position has high turnover for this exact reason, because people will join, get the SQL training, and then study hard on their own, and then leave 1-2 years later when they realize they can do better in pay and benefits.
