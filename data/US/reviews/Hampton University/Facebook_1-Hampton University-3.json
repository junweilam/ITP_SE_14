I knew people in my department making as low as 42K a year as an assistant professor. \r\n-Faculty have no voice at all, not with the administration. At least in my department, you didn't even have control over content covered in any class.\r\n-Even if your position is technically tenure track, you'll likely never get tenure. It's only possible if you're bringing in huge grants. If you're in a field without big grants, it's not going to happen.\r\n-Rediculous courseloads. You may be told 4/4 when you interview, but, at least in my department and several others, it was mandatory. Teaching up to seven or eight classes a semester happened regularly. \r\n-You have to do two grants a year and receive them or else you're given a poor review.\r\n-Verbal abuse from higher-ups. \r\n-You essentially only get Christmas Eve to New Year's Day off for Christmas break. \r\n-They do 3 different faculty institutes for three weeks of the year, before the year begins, before the second semester, and after the second semester. They're nearly always an absolute waste of time, covering topics that don't apply to all departments. They once brought a speaker that proceeded to bash millennials for their entire time though faculty present were millennials. They in all my years there never once actually told anyone what days they are. It was assumed you'd know. I had to tack down so many new faculty to make sure they actually knew about it.\r\n-There's a lot of committee work\r\n-70+ hour work weeks\r\n-Offices and classrooms without AC, even in summer\r\n-Little to no classroom technology unless you're buying it yourself, yet you are required to use technology or you will receive a poor review. I spent too much money on projectors and the like. \r\n-Zero professional development \r\n-The Hampton Run-Around is real. \r\n-No university credit cards. Places I've worked since providing them to all faculty. The business office keeps very tight control over anything that costs money. If you plan on going to any conferences (I'd be shocked if you were even allowed to go to any) it's out of your own pocket. \r\n-Access to blackboard for you classes takes weeks\r\n- Dossiers are outrageous. You need 15 letters of recommendation and it'll likely be around a 1000 page document.  You do them regardless of if you're looking to get tenure or not. I also recall the gentleman that was running the whole review thing for them badmouthing past participants something awful. \r\n-There's a significant amount of paperwork. You have self-assessments, regular write-ups on where you are with writing grants, write-ups on recruitment, and the amount of paperwork you turn in at the end of the semester quite large. \r\n-Deans don't care at all about their faculty. At my current job, the dean knows me personally. He asks how I'm doing regularly and is all around wonderful. It doesn't have to be like that.\r\n-Anti-LGBTQ. I witnessed a lot of hateful rhetoric.
