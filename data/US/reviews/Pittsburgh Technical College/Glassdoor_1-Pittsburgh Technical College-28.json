Those who leave are not replaced and their work is dumped on those left behind. There's a hiring freeze but somehow the favorites are still getting positions filled. Policies are outdated by several years. Leadership is cutting benefits left and right and expecting employees to thank them. The best thing that could happen to PTC is to get in a union. The abuse would surely stop and employees would have some protections. Finally, the president does not know what she is doing but is quick to blame others.
