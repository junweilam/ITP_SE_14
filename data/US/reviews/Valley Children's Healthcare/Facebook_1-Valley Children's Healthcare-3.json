It\u2019s hard to not get emotionally attached. This facility just lacks employee recognition, support and appreciation. Their idea of appreciation is handing out left over cafeteria lunch boxes that will give your coworker the runs (true story). Not to mention the number of times they\u2019ve floated nurses to unsafe areas and placed patients at risk. They\u2019d rather have a body to do the job than a competent person doing the job. There\u2019s so much that happens here behind closed doors and there\u2019s lack of accountability. They\u2019d rather hush things up than face them head on.

Executives continue to create top level positions, while bedside staff go without basic resources to provide the best care possible.   It's more important to have state of the art glass in a new building and new grass for the Harvest Ball than to have  enough staff and the right equipment to care for kids.  Executive leadership blames and shames the teams that are actually doing the work of caring for kids."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It\u2019s a great place to start, not a great place to advance in your career.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Staff RN in Fresno, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a great place to get pediatric experience as a nurse. Pediatric care is so hard to come by in the Valley, it\u2019s also great specialized care. You work with people who really care about their jobs and their patients!", "cons": "The company has changed so much. I spent over half a decade here. I\u2019ve ran into people who have left and felt the same lack of appreciation by the organization. The pay is not competitive and to be honest after years of working and getting paid a few dollars more than a new grad, you just don\u2019t want to work as hard. They give staff zero motivation to move forward. There\u2019s also no opportunities to advance. People aren\u2019t retiring, there is a bit of favoritism and people can be petty. There are people who talk down to peers or continuously violate policies and they don\u2019t get penalized for it. You just get tired of watching people get away with things. I\u2019ve also had a coworker say the CEO once say something along the lines like, \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of nurses lined up out there to take new positions\u201d. I left and it\u2019s been the best experience for me. I got a five figure sign on bonus at another competitive hospital in the area, competitive pay, great affordable benefits, discounts for my meals (plus amazing food!)... little things of course but it means so much when you go without it for so long! Overall, it\u2019s a great place to start but after a year or two it\u2019s time to just move on. I wish I would\u2019ve left sooner, but I loved working with kids and I loved my patients. It\u2019s hard to not get emotionally attached. This facility just lacks employee recognition, support and appreciation. Their idea of appreciation is handing out left over cafeteria lunch boxes that will give your coworker the runs (true story). Not to mention the number of times they\u2019ve floated nurses to unsafe areas and placed patients at risk. They\u2019d rather have a body to do the job than a competent person doing the job. There\u2019s so much that happens here behind closed doors and there\u2019s lack of accountability. They\u2019d rather hush things up than face them head on. They\u2019re so focused on community expansion and outreach that they\u2019re failing to provide their healthcare workers with the resources they need like adequate staffing, computers that work, enough interpreters... the list just goes on."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good environment, less pay", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Madera, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working environment with everyone being very friendly and willing to help, fair nurse:patient ratios", "cons": "Pay is less than many other hospitals in the area, with infrequent pay raises.
