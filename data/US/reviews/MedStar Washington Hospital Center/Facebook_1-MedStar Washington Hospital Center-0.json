The management does not care about its employees. In spite the fact that we worked in a hospital, we had to pay a big chunk of money to be insured. The worst part is the colleagues and the HR they are very self centred, they do not care about work morals or ethics. The HR is very unresponsive and if they pick up the phone they are so unkind and act like they own the hospital. Please remember you are just employees who work for others. Specially that woman called Kaitlin she is so rude. They do not compensate those who leave or honour their work by giving them their legal rights.

The rule is no working remotely, even for people who are not doctors or nurses and who just work in offices.  But some people get to break the rule if their manager feels like it. This rule is very outdated for today's offices-- no laptops offered. Good managers get better; not so good or uncaring managers can stay that way without being \"coached\" for as long as the work gets done. Lots of jobs there, but not very much care for lower-level employees to grow and get better positions. Middle managers are lucky if there is a next step up for them. Very slow and relatively expensive cafeteria (for what you get) makes lunchtime a pain. Parking and parking shuttles are not convenient at all. \r\nAppreciation is shown weird ways.

They stopped saying that around me, but I am not foolish enough to think that it stopped all together.\r\n-  institutional racism many non-white workers but very few if any non-white upper level management.  Also, ther is a large amount of white suburban/ rural staff that travels to work for higher wages in the city and the local largly non-white patient and staff population don't always play nice in the sandbox and I witnessed many \"us v. them\" conversations and situations \r\n- management and the union are too focused on battleing one another for them to spend money, time, or concern on the front line staff \r\n- Poor worker moral... any wonder why?
