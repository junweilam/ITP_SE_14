No engagement with the staff, just a fake front. Funny, Forbes list Phelps as a top place to work in Missouri but the results of the actual employee surveys show less that 28% think it is a good place to work.  IT is even lower.  How does that happen?  A management goal was to improve employee satisfaction by a couple %. Very sad that mid year the survey results were so bad that they made managers remove this as a goal as it appears it was not achievable, ie see above, and not making goals means no increases. So, you can imagine management didn't what this as a goal for the department and affect them, but the funny thing is the toxic management caused the current situation.  All employees have been recently sent the annual employee survey.   The IT department surveys will unanimously  show a no confidence vote from which the current leadership will not recover.  There has been confusion in the past of which level of management was being referenced in employee answers.  The CEO just needs to read the comments this time to see where the problem lies.  FYI, no one was allowed to see survey comments from the last annual employee survey as they were so bad.
