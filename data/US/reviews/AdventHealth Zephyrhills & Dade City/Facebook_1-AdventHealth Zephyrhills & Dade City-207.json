The recruiter stated it was because \"my attitude\" didnt meet their company culture?? \n\nFor background, this recruiter gave me the wrong interview day, after giving me the correct one (she change the day from correct to incorrect). I had arrived on the correct day luckily on a hunch (ive had bad experiences with this recruiter before) and the supervisor was super upset the recruiter attempted to change the day. I had informed hr and was told the recruiter got repremanded. Last week, I had asked the recruiter in a email to negotiate pay with me after seeing offer letter as they were well below market comps and my previous salaries, but never heard back. So i signed the letter bc i liked the team, so a pay cut really didnt matter at the end of the day. \nWensday i was on campus doing premployment and everyone was super nice. after i met my supervisors in my department, and they were also super nice. no indication of problems up until todays phone call from the recruiter.\n\nI texted both supervisors telling them recruitment told me the offer was recinded. And thanked them for their time. Then I called HR, who had no clue my offer was recinded..they have me coming in on monday for orientation still. Hr stated they would reach out to recruiter to figure out what happened, and i havent got a call back yet. Nor an email confirmation saying my offer was recinded. I still show up as hired in the system. So i have to drive to orientation monday to find out if im still employed or not.\n\nSo now im possibly out $3500 in moving fees, have to buy myself out of the new apartment for god knows how much, plus $200 wasted in embroidered scrubs i cant use.\n\nStay away from advent health, the rumors are true, and their recruiter for florida is a petty tyrant.
