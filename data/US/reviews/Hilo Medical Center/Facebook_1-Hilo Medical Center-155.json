Unfortunately nearly the entire floor which is medical unit is SO POORLY run. The nurses have 8 patients on day shift, giving blood, performing PD, going to CT scan. Because they are over worked and under staffed, the rest of the hospital suffers...I.e. Patient can't be admitted to ICU from ER because there's no beds because the medical CC won't book transfers out of ICU. Another major CON is that there is no cardiac or neuro surgeon=no cardiac catch lab=fly our all STEMIs and many strokes.
