As we've transitioned from audacious idea and scrappy startup into early maturity, there have been opportunities to wear a wide variety of hats, to take on a lot of responsibility, and to grow professionally as a result. I've enjoyed being pushed to grow by a super talented group of engineers, PMs, and designers, as well as in my cross-functional work with incredibly sharp and thoughtful coworkers on other teams.\r\n\r\nWorking with students in a variety of contexts had been stimulating - I've gotten the opportunity to work with students in technical work-study positions, to manage student teams  during summer internships, participate in student events, and share career advice with some of our soon-to-be-graduates.\r\n\r\nGetting to dogfood Minerva classes (e.g. currently trialing a forthcoming management and complexity science course aimed at graduate and professional levels) is awesome.\r\n\r\nIt's been incredibly satisfying seeing the hypotheses about better higher education come to fruition as we went from no students to graduating our first class. My experience on the Product (engineering) team have been one characterized by a surprising amount of stability and work/life balance compared to other companies I've seen peers at during a similar point in company development. I've also gotten the pleasure of working with teammates for an a period of time that's unusual in Silicon Valley startup land - roughly one quarter of the Product team over time had tenures of over 4 years, and the average tenure is a little over 3 years (including folks who were hired fewer than 3 years ago).", "cons": "The transition from scrappy startup to mature organization wasn't always smooth. It was a challenge to move from a colocated company to a distributed one, and we had to develop skills and structures (remote-first, more async communication, more proactive checkin on the part of management) along the. Staffing levels have been a concern for various teams at various times -- as we built a university from scratch we didn't always predict staffing needs accurately and this required people to stretch to cover student needs. I think that the experience of folks on the Product (engineering) about sustainable work pace and work/life balance are not reflective of the experiences that others have had."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Meaningful job with amazing team", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Senior Engineer in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Having followed the educational technology industry for many years, I can confidently say that Minerva is one of the few companies that deeply care about improving student learning - on the one hand boldly believing that they can do far better than even elite universities currently do, on the other hand being humble enough to realise that we have much to learn and that success comes from strong first principles, and then an ongoing process of continuous improvement. I have been very impressed by how closely engineers and product managers work with curriculum developers and students to create more engaging experiences.\r\n\r\nThe engineering team is very diverse, highly remote-friendly, and consists of people who are both technically very strong, but also all motivated by the mission of Minerva. We work very closely with faculty, students and partners, and are able to have a lot of input into feature design, technical approaches and execution. Product team is only about 25 people, so nobody is \"just a number\", everyone have their unique skills and approaches to contribute, and my manager has been very supportive in thinking about how to grow and develop, not just as an engineer.

We are very proactive about testing, but engineers often have to jump in and help with escalated issues - while it's good to see firsthand the pain points of customers, I hope we can get to a point where we will feel more confident in the code. Part of the reason, apart from the old code, is that we're currently expanding from our main partner (Minerva Schools) to a number of new partners, each requiring a fair amount of customization etc as we work on \"crossing the chasm\"."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Best Job I've Ever Had", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people I get to work with everyday are incredible\u2014 whip-smart, super competent, professional, kind, thoughtful and humble.\r\n \r\nThe mission is highly rewarding and we get an up-close view of how our daily work impacts our students.
