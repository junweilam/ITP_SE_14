Many of my colleagues have too many students or advisees. Student services seems understaffed but this could be due to the pandemic.\r\nSome staff members are treated badly by their supervisors. The leader of one of the areas says terrible things about their employees to other staff. It doesn't seem legal. It is disconcerting. The college is always searching for more workers in this area. There seems to be rancor in some areas of the college about past deeds of the administration. It's a theme across campus and brings down morale. \r\nBudgets for departments are low across the aboard and everything is on a 2 year budget plan? It makes it difficult to plan for replacement equipment or purchases. I've seen colleagues struggle to get basics to run their programs.\r\nSome professors, staff and students are conservative. If you are liberal, you may need to re-calibrate your language to be successful with students. The area is rural and remote. Be prepared to drive two hours for more varied foodstuffs.
