Management frequently hit the floor with 6-8 admissions within 4 hours.  Instead of fairly distributing admissions they just pick floor favorites.  \r\nComputers are often broken for days or weeks or months. Other equipment and facilities out of order for months. \r\nFire department banned anything to hold supplies right outside rooms. In other hospitals there are cabinets full of supplies for nurses to easily access right outside the room. \r\nAfter that, an Infectious disease nurse banned unused, sealed,  sterile supplies in rooms. So you constantly have to run back and forth to get supplies from the nurses station which is not close to most of the rooms, even then at the stations supplies are frequently not stocked. This waste a lot of time and disrupts work flow. \r\nThey implement rules and changes without feedback from staff.  It is very top down instead of shared governance.  \r\nToo much charting at specific times,  can get behind when you get admissions right when you can chart and to have it count. \r\nUpper management,  like the CEO care about only money.  He gave himself a nice ~$1 million dollar bonus last year,  bragged about it with a very prominent and public paper posting at the south campus, while nurses only had a paltry 25 cents to $1 raise an
