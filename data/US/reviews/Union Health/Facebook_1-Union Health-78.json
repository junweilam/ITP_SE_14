Management engages in egregious disciplinary practices going as far as writing up its employees for being sick even after providing doctor's notes from within their own system. FYI for Union, its against the law to terminate someone's employment for being sick. (Not applicable in my case however Management engaged in activities that would have ultimately led to this in my case as I felt singled out.
