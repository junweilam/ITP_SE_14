If you are in the clinical world, you know this is saying a lot. Skyland Trail represents what every mental health program should be. This is not a place where you put a band-aid on clients.... you can actually work with them everyday providing therapy and see results.  Clients come here voluntarily. We are a completely open campus which provides treatments to a certain type of patients- those wanting and willing to be in services. We work as a treatment team and the support and supervision is always available.  The staff is personable and professional (I LOVE my coworkers), the campus is beautiful, and the clinical services are challenging. We have been around for 25 years (I have been with the company for 6) and we are still looking for ways to grow, improve and make a difference for our clients and the community.  I find employment here incredibly rewarding.  Salary has been fair, if not better than most mental health companies in Atlanta, and every year their is room for a raise. They provide a 403 match. For full time employees - medical benefits are available and great! They always take the time to educate us on perks available as well as request our input.  I am a big fan of Skyland Trail and have been honored to work for such an amazing company.", "cons": "Part of the culture of mental health facilities is being able to provide the best and most appropriate services. We are a private non-for profit company. While we accept private insurances, we are not in network with all insurance, nor do we accept medicare or medicaid. With that being said, the cost associated for incoming patients can be prohibitive.  Aside from financial concerns, we may not be the perfect fit (clinically speaking) for everyone.  I believe, it is better for us to specialize and be confident with what we do than to try an do everything average.  Part of the process is making sure that we are able to meet the needs and goals of our client, which may mean referring them to another program. While I would like to help everyone, this is not always possible. We are always able to provide other resources or recommendations, but coming from a clinical background, this can be quite challenging for patients and their families.   Another issue- growth. We are working to grow and expand our services all the time, however, the actual facility has to get bigger in order for us to accommodate staff as well as patients.  This has been a huge focus for Skyland Trail and we are going to be seeing some of these changes in the future to improve the spatial needs of a growing campus.  Lastly, in all mental health facilities I have worked for, there is usually a rift between the clinical side and the business side.  In order to be a great provider, we have to work together. While the clinical team may want ten new counselors, the business team may know what is actual feasible. There are weekly meetings with all team members to keep everyone abreast of changes and opportunities.  While we don't always agree, we are always brainstorming ways to improve and compromise as well as using our Board of Professional for an outsider's perspective and expert advice."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Easy job Terrible team", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Human Resources Generalist in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The workload wasn't heavy \r\nThe grounds were beautiful\r\nThe employees were receptive", "cons": "The executive team made many decisions without taking everyone's role into account\r\nThe turnover is crazy\r\nThe communication between locations often fell short"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Job", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Nurse in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to make a difference in the client's life", "cons": "The clients are more important than the staff"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Recreational Therapist", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Avondale Estates, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Really fun job, great supportive team.", "cons": "The pay is not great, and you have to work weekends."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Former Employee", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Oct 2015", "job_title": "Development Services Coordinator in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for!", "cons": "I enjoyed my time there"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Very high turn over with staff", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Patient Billing in Atlanta, GA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The cafeteria is nice benefit", "cons": "They need a better billing system"}]]
