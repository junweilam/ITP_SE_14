Vanderbilt has been \"facing headwinds\" for years and has been cutting staff, over working the remaining staff, cutting pay by not giving raises for 5 years, cutting vacation time, reducing benefits, and outsourcing their talent to other companies to try to make up for these oft mentioned \"headwinds.\"   So while they have a 5 billion dollar endowment, they choose to make the people caring for you in the hospital balance on their financial backs the short comings of the Leadership by taking away the financial incentive for that care. Quality of care will decline if the people caring for you are worried if they will have a job tomorrow, since they just saw half of their colleagues get cut/outsourced.  Middle management is rarely listened to and Senior Leadership is a top down command and control system that brokers no dissidents.  The pay for performance rating is a joke.  There have been no raises for the workers in 5 years and even when they did give a token raise it was limited by the Senior Leadership.  Leadership gives the marching orders of how many people will get raises at any given rating in a department and then your review is lowered to match those numbers, often by a manager that never knows what you do on a day to day basis."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Fast-Paced, Willingness to Train", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Mar 2018", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Nashville, TN", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Vanderbilt offers great pay, wonderful benefits, and upward mobility no matter how low on the ladder your position may be.

Change happens so rapidly at institutions of this size and across the healthcare landscape, and these clinicians adapt so well. I admire these outstanding clinicians for the incredible services and outcomes they deliver to patients daily.", "cons": "Hospital administration  has many areas for improvement. The culture is very toxic. Specific cons include: 1. making employees pay to park 2. executive officers playing favoritism to more attractive female associates -- one associate with one year of experience out of undergrad became \"director\" of an entire service line literally overnight after talking with the then COO that \"she was better than these tasks\"... yet she had zero prior job experience or expertise in the domain...that seems fishy.  Sounds like a c-suite desire for eye candy to me. 3. office buildings spread out so far that you spend half your day (literally) going to different locations for meetings 4. employees are charged a considerable monthly fee for campus gym access, which makes zero sense given the substantial productivity benefit directly related to employee mental and physical health, not to mention engagement and association with colleagues and being on campus as well as it being a nominal cost center for the university. 4. duplicative projects/initiatives everywhere. I lost track of the number of projects and engagements that I either led or supported that were duplicated or repeated in some shape/form within 18 months. 5. The org is very siloed. There are at least 6-7 different quality/improvement/consulting teams and departments that do similar or identical work with many overlapping projects. This creates culture issues, hostile environments, and wasted effort. 6. \"Overly most-wired\" hospital. They pride themselves on being a most-wired hospital yet performance outcomes are average relative to the US measures. This is why the clinicians here have a higher than usual hatred for tech, b/c most of that implemented here is not necessary... it's a fix for a symptom, not the problem(s) themselves. 7.  Bureaucratic, \"put-in-your-time-good-ol-boys\" culture, opposite of a meritocracy. IF you're looking for a merit-based org with promotions based solely on performance, this is not the place. The promotion/advancement culture here is very much like a law firm, where someone with 25 years of experience automatically gets a position over someone with 21 years of experience, even if the other person is more qualified. Because apparently only years matter. I was told that my next promotion would be a while because others had 20+ years of experience. Mind you these \"others\" were part of departments and groups that were commonly under-performing and/or not delivering any value, lacked effort to grow/learn, and had limited breadth of industry knowledge of latest industry imperatives and success standards. Yet they were \"more polished\" for promotions, solely because they were well connected with other tenured senior leaders. Makes sense. And the results of such show... why the problems are chronic and cyclical, happening over again about ~18 months or sooner. My favorite icing on the cake was while riding over with one executive to a cross-campus meeting -- after not finding a front row parking spot she said that she guesses \"that I'll just have to park on an upper floor with all the minions.\" I was floored. Very reflective of the culture. 8. Use it or lose it PTO structure. This is the worst structure for incentivizing employees to take vacation. While I totally understand the rationale from a financial standpoint (lowering the amount of carryover liability for unused PTO to next fiscal year/ tax year), many positions, namely clinicians, have inflexible PTO schedules, where employees can't take the PTO days even when they're expiring. Their requests are declined and they lose the PTO hours/days. 9. Limited recognition of your work; there was non-existent efforts to make employees feel valued and like our work mattered.  Often times it felt like the immensely high-value work I produced (with a great supporting cast) was irrelevant b/c decisions were already made by senior leadership based on their personal beliefs, as though our work was a formality for political reasons. 10. No exit interview\u2026 at all. Hence why these problems persist year after year\u2026 explain to me why has the CHRO Traci not been fired yet?

Apparently not. \r\n\r\nI got paid $12 an hour, 32 hours a week and had to pay almost $50 a month for parking in *their* parking garage. I didn't even know my manager's name, and was also assigned to a unit where I explicitly said in my interview I wasn't comfortable working.That speaks for itself the culture of this place.\r\n\r\nThey talk big game about wanting to create a \"healthy\" & \"ethical\" work environment, but if you actually question things it does nothing but make people mad. There were multiple unethical things happening & I had no one to report to about it that would listen or do anything.\r\n\r\nThe model itself for the work I did was skewed & wasteful of the patient's time and money. Maybe if they had someone other than a military guy with a *business* degree running it, they'd be able to change things. \r\n\r\nOverall, it makes me mad that this is considered such a high quality facility yet it had such low standards of care in terms of regular, direct mental health support available to patients. They come here for mental health support, what's the point if their doctor is almost never there to talk to them or give them guidance on how to spend their time? A psych nurse is NOT remotely a therapist. \r\n\r\nHaving patients sit & color or watch TV is not helpful. As an MHS I was essentially babysitting & I hated having my hands tied.

Night shift has zero options for free parking. Day shift has one very inconvenient option for free parking. \r\n- Employees get an \"occurence\" for every absence, even with a doctor's note. They expect hospital employees to come to work with sick and immuno-compromised patients. No excuses. \r\n- Employees with longevity and good work history are treated no different from those with a poor company history. \r\n- Benefits to working at Vanderbilt are constantly being taken away. Health insurance keeps going up, tuition assistance is being taken away. \r\n- Hospital wide policies are constantly made that negatively impact some departments with no consideration to the individual needs of each department. \r\n- Nurses are treated considerably better than tech staff and have much less accountability than they should have. Techs will be fired before a nurse even when the nurse should have been responsible. \r\n- A lot of micromanagement from people running multiple departments that have no idea about the tasks and responsibilities of some of the departments they oversee. \r\n- Raises are minimal. Maybe 2% if you've been good. There are no raises based on merit. Doesn't even offset parking increases.\r\n- The staff to patient ratios are poor. \r\n- Management does not take into consideration staff suggestions or input. \r\n- There is little opportunity to advance in this institution. \r\n- Profits are much more important to Vanderbilt than quality of care. \r\n- Campus is riddled with cockroaches and rats. \r\n- in the adult hospital there is only one cleaning person at night.
