I gave her the additional info told her I was okay with the added responsibility of driving 100 miles per week to Irvine (generous on my part).  After that I heard nothing.. they didn't even have the courtesy to let me know they had gone in a different direction.

Recruiter was very nice and professional but did not much about culture of campus since she was not on campus but sits in administration building. Interview schedule changed a few times. Phone interview was more like a quick scan of what's on your resume then meeting with manager/program director who asked questions already on my resume.

The first phone interview with human resources went well and they scheduled me for a second phone interview. At the scheduled time I waited for the call which never came.  After waiting 15 minutes I emailed asking if the call was still happening. Over two hours later I got an email saying the call is cancelled and that they reviewed my background and have no current positions that are the right fit. Could they have told me that BEFORE I spent the day prepping for the second interview? YES a professional human resources department would have. This experience was total waste of my time and showed a complete lack of courtesy in the way they treat people — a bad reflection on AMDA’s staff.,0.9984968,0.0013182455,0.00018497715
I submitted an application through email and the next day was contacted for a phone screening with an HR person. At the time of the phone screen the HR person just completely flaked  no attempt to contact me was made. The following day I got another email from HR asking to reschedule the phone screening without any acknowledgement (let alone apology) that I had been stood up. When the phone screen finally happened about a week later all seemed to go well (although it was still never acknowledged that I had been stood up the previous week). I got a phone interview with an executive the following day. That interview went well too. I checked back in with HR about 1.5 weeks later and was told I would hear about potential next steps by the end of the following week. The end of the following week came and went and I didn't hear from anyone. A week later I wrote to HR again inquiring about the position and got no response. I sent a final email about a week after that to say that I was weighing other job offers and would need to know soon if I was still in the running. No response. Nothing. I thought it was all very disrespectful of the time and effort I put into the process.,0.95662117,0.04314312,0.00023575746
"This process was rushed; I interviewed twice and essentially knew I had the position after the first interview.

Absolutely terrible experience. Interviewed with a recruiter who placed a blind ad. They were planning on firing their current Marketing Director. I had several interviews with the recruiter before finally getting an opportunity to speak with the HR Manager. I was told the phone interview went well and then I was passed along to speak with their InHouse Counsel. This person told me the meeting went well and that I would get to interview with their President. Well weeks went by and no update or feedback. I tried emailing and calling the recruiter and HR Manager and asking for an update. None came. Finally I get an email from the recruiter claiming they were going with another candidate. Well the same day they reposted the same blind ad on several websites for the exact same job. They basically lied to me. I guess this was probably a good thing as I spoke to a former employer who told me it was a terrible place to work as the President was mercurial and tended to micromanage.,0.98122907,0.018277943,0.0004929097
One of the more degrading interviews I have ever been a part of. After a phone interview and a second round in person interview I sent a thank you email. It’s been 3 months and I still have not heard anything. Not a note to say they would get back to me or a simple rejection. The manager seemed overworked and was very condescending even though I’m pretty sure I had more experience than she does. Seems like a terrible place to work.,0.9986866,0.0011624842,0.00015094952

Two HR personnel present at the interview. They questioned me from a list of premade interview questions and had copies of my application.   The questions were very general however the interviewers did not seem to be interested in my answers and rushed onto the next question repeatedly. I was also grilled about a gap in employment in which I provided reasonable answers but the interviewers did not seem to believe me.

That final question had come up more than once so the next day I addressed it in an email together with a word of thanks for the meeting.

"Talent Acquisition contacted me for a 1:1 virtual interview progressing to a second round virtual 1:1 meeting with the department’s director. Third and final interview was again virtual with Academic IT. Submitted references (survey format for those submitting references on my behalf) and completed Babson's ""new"" Manager Assessment simulation. I prepped for the simulation and though it wasn't straightforward or libraryrelated in any way I thought I did well. The simulation was centered on an important client who just launched your company's software which was not working as expected. Part of the simulation also involved a live video discussion with an actor essentially playing the part of an employee who was not willing to do their load of the work. Again I thought it went well. This is where it starts to get shady/dubious: the Talent Acquisition person calls to offer me the position and the proposed salary is the max in the range (range was $7684k). In summary: three VIRTUAL interviews I never meet the director in person never meet the library staff and conversely they never meet me and Babson offers the max salary. This is where my identity comes into play: I'm not White I understand Babson like many highered institutions wants to get on the DEI marketing bandwagon but it's unimaginable that a prominent business school would hire someone without ever meeting them in person AND offer them the max in the range. My gut certainly said this is illogical. In the end I accepted the verbal offer but a day or two later I received a succinct email from Talent Acquisition stating the offer was contingent based on references and the manager assessment to which I listened to my gut and inquired whether there was an issue with my references (the same references I've had for the last couple of jobs which resulted in my getting offers from them and elsewhere). Talent Acquisition stated the combination of the references and manager assessment scores forced them to rescind their offer. And of course HR cannot share the results of either. It would be interesting to see what readers of this scenario think and how their respective identities influence their interpretation. Am I BIPOCidentifying reading too much into it and it was an objective metricbased decision or did they have other candidates in mind and needed to have a nonWhite candidate as a finalist? (Mind you HR stated that once hired HR's Talent Development team would work with the person to improve areas as noted by the manager assessment. And I have worked in higher education for more than a decade; seven of those years in managing staff.) This is highered and most importantly this is the highered experience when you're BIPOC or identify from another marginalized group. You have no idea what the truth is nor will you ever know. My lesson in this for the umpteenth time: never trust PWIs if you're BIPOC   listen to your gut.",0.9968694,0.002999062,0.0001315757

This was one of the worst interview experiences of my life. I’ll spare the details leading up to it but the day itself was long and tortuous. Eighthours of interviewing with people who asked the same questions over and over again. Some of which made no sense in terms of what the interviewer was looking for in terms of an answer. Poor internet connection on campus for virtual interviews led to choppy dialog videos in and out and having to repeat oneself over and over again. Following the longday adventure more interviews virtually the following week. Again repeat questions asked. Then weeks of silence just to be followed up with a generic “no thanks” email.  The killer was another candidate already worked there and was around on the interview day so was told to act like I was a salesperson. Then was told by many they really like to promote from within.  Awesome  glad to hear.  It seems like a more phased approach would have been more helpful and they could have weaned me out much earlier. But we know that companies/academia like to have “options” or be able to prove why an internal candidate is the best choice so am annoyed that I was the “fall person” to prove that.  Maybe I was maybe I wasn’t. But it sure felt like a huge waste of time for all involved due to the poor planning overall.,0.99677473,0.0030030785,0.00022214434

Job was advertised in August 2021 I applied in October had a 1st round interview in November and then a Final round interview in January. The panel said that I would hear back from them in 2 weeks. I withdrew yesterday (February) because they have not communicated the results yet. A complete waste of time definitely not worth the effort. In addition to a lack of professionalism on the hiring official's part a large majority of the team members in the panel inter iew seemed unmotivated to participate in the interview.

"Two rounds of interviews. First was with a panel of three and the second was with the head of the department. Was offered the position at Bellevue College.

They offered me the lower range of the stated budget and yet they were TOTALLY unwilling to negotiate even a little bit. I was basically told ""this is the budget for this position. Accept it or we'll move on"".  I believe Bellevue College puts higher salary ranges on their online application and then actually offers a lower salary when the time comes. I would suggest being upfront with your requirements (and their honest budget for the position) or staying away all together.

I applied online and received a phone call from HR the same day.  We scheduled a phone interview to be done within a week.  After the phone interview with HR I had a phone interview with the hiring manager a few days later.  The hiring manager stated he would select three individuals as finalists for the final in person interview which would include him as well as the president of the community college.  The in person interview consisted of a 10 minute long power point that I had to developed based off the information that I had via the school's website.    After the interview I was told that a selection would be made within a few days and I would hear back.  Almost a month went by and I was the one that had to make contact regarding the position.  At the end I was not selected yet I was offered to have another final interview at a different community college that was further away from me.  I declined this offer mainly because my lack of experience of the area the long commute through Los Angeles traffic as well as the lack of communication through the interview process.

Applied on their website and got an email to schedule a phone interview about three weeks later. The phone interview was pretty typical about twenty minutes or so. I really appreciated that the HR rep I spoke to was fully upfront about the salary range for the position to make sure it was within what I was looking for. He said that I should hear from them either for next steps or otherwise by the end of the following week and I did.

"Applied online in February  two weeks later received an email to set up a phone interview  with HR for the following week.  A few days after the phone interview I received an email from HR with an invitation to campus. I came to campus about two weeks later and met with two senior staff members.  A few days after that I received a invitation to come to campus a second time for the final round. About  two weeks later I had a final interview with the director then met with the person who would be my supervisor followed by a student lead tour and then a final meeting with HR to discuss salary starting date benefits and timeline for hearing back.   I was told I would hear back within two weeks at the very latest either way. The HR rep was very insistent that I would hear from her personally with news on what was happening. About two weeks had passed and I had emailed the HR rep to see if there was any update. After about a week of no response  I called and left a voice message and I sent one last follow up email which was not returned. A few days later I emailed the woman that would have served as my direct supervisor as she had given me her business card during the interview and told me to reach out with any questions at all. A week later I heard back from her as she was out of the office traveling for work  she insisted that it should not be much longer and asked if I was able to ""hold on"" as decisions should be finalized by the end of the week at the latest.   The end of the week came and went with no word from anyone. About a week and a half later I sent an email to the director who also gave me her contact information asking if their was any update on final decisions. She responded almost immediately with a very friendly greeting stating ""That position has already been filled by an alumni I am so sorry that no one ever informed you of that!"".  Overall this was the worst interview experience I have ever had. I have never heard of a finalist not hearing back. It was very challenging having to ask other institutions I was receiving offers from at the same time for more time to only not ever hear back from Bentley. My issue lies with HR as I was told I would hear directly from them (all offers come from HR at Bentley) and never heard a word from them after 3 contact attempts. As a 1st round candidate I could understand but as a finalist who had just spent 6 hours on campus this is unacceptable and flat out rude and unprofessional.",0.9971674,0.002699229,0.00013336372
"After a 5 minute talk with HR over the phone had a 3 hour long interview on campus. Met with a few different staff members and discussed experience goals of department mutual connections etc. The interview seemed to go pretty well in my opinion but I didn't get my hopes up because I'm sure they had very qualified candidates.  Glad I wasn't holding my breath. It's been close to five months since I applied and the online portal has changed from ""Finalist"" to ""Hold B"" to ""In Progress"" back and forth about a dozen times now no rhyme or reason no closure and no explanation of what each status actually means. Nobody has reached out to me and worse all have continued to ignore my requests for any kind of status update.  I've clearly moved on after this amount of time and have accepted a job elsewhere but felt the need to express my disappointment and frankly my complete shock at how the hiring process at Bentley was handled. It's a pity because I enjoyed the team and could have seen myself working there but after this whole mess I don't think it would ever be a good fit. I generally expect my teammates and colleagues to be responsive and respectful even if a clear answer isn't available. Bad first impressions tend to stick.",0.99432486,0.0054717576,0.00020336774

Cucchi Suzanne (Admin. & Technical Coordinator) contacted me to interview with Fred Bachofner The Manager of the Help Desk and Computing Services.   I spoke to Fred in the interviewed and he informed he wanted to hire a person who would take a pay cut as the position would only pay about $18 Hourly. He Asked me a few IT related questions which I answered correctly. ( I have about 10 yrs in the IT industry). After the interview process ended (20 minutes) he mentioned he would notified me the next week of the next step.  I waited the 1 week and not response back from Fred. I email him the next week and still no response. By this time all the high hopes I had being part of this institution were fading away as I realized that these folks were not going to get back at me.  Weeks later I review their website portal and the position was still available but I could not apply again since I already had been interview. This position was open for weeks/months  until.  3 months later I received an email notifying me that the position was filled.  I personally think that i should've been at least notified immediately that I did not qualified for this position if they had determined that my 10yrs strong background did not meed their needs.   Bentley University has poor ethical morals for folks looking for a job. they have no respect for people actively seeking employment opportunities and cannot be trusted as a responsible institution due to the fact that they lack commonsense common cortesy and and deeply selfcentered in making more money and reducing cost by paying the least amount of wages as possible.

Was contacted about a week or so after applying through the college website by a very nice woman. She emailed me and asked me to come in for an interview at the Woodland Park location. She was very friendly and gave me a tour of the campus which was 2 buildings because construction was still being done on the 3rd building.   The interview lasted about an hour and was very casual and more discussion based rather than bombarding me with questions. I was offered the position and would have loved to accept it but they only offered me one class a week which turned out to be $200 weekly. Economically it didn't make sense for me because I would have needed to work fulltime on top of that and the class was only offered twice a week during the middle of the day.,0.61187214,0.3771193,0.0110084945

"Applied online in January 2017. Got an email for a phone screen in probably late February or March.

Not sure how you can screen someone in or out not knowing what the actual job function is.

"This was the most disrespectful approach and incredibly negative interview experience imaginable. Told that I was to meet with the Chief of Staff and Director of HR regarding my candidacy a meeting was scheduled 2 weeks in advance. After spending 4 hours preparing for my interview with talking points published and printed materials strategies for the role dressing the part and interviewing other staff about the role I was told up front at the meeting that I was not selected for next round.   The HR Director didn't even attend as promised (I was not notified in advance). My materials were not even looked at and the meeting lasted all of 7 minutes (would have been much shorter had I not pressed my case). Having been in an active job search for some time I can certainly handle rejection but seriously an email would have been sufficient. I didn't need to waste all my time and effort to be told in a meeting that I wasn't being considered.   I should note that this is not my first totally negative experience with this employer and I should also note that I have been a longtime employee there with success in a wide variety of roles. It's unfortunate that they disrespect their employees consistently and never promote from within. They are ""allergic"" to internal hires (I was told this by a senior person). I would recommend that you seriously consider NOT seeking a job here as you will be treated callously and will have zero chance for advancement.

To save everyone's valuable time I wish had been up front about the salary or hourly pay rate in the job posting. If they had I would have never applied.

I was invited to a group interview that consisted of about 12 people. We sat before a panel of about 8 people and were asked a number of questions pertaining to the job and certain scenarios. The whole thing lasted about 3 1/2 hours.

I spoke with two people: the Director of University Communications and Marketing and the Associate Director of Interactive Media. It's a small shop so I worked closely with the latter person after I was hired. The questions from the Director of University Communications and Marketing were higherlevel questions aimed in part at making sure I understood and was ontrack with the mission of the team. They focus primarily on the outwarddirected aspects of design (the public face of the University working to attract prospective students etc.) rather than the inwardfocused aspects (e.g. assisting faculty with Blackboard issues). The second interviewer asked more technical questions about my background my skill set and my willingness to continue learning and developing as a web designer.,0.0021715625,0.9976255,0.00020286757
The interview process was a group interview process with about twenty or so applicants.  We were all interviewed by a panel of about ten interviewers.  I felt very nervous at the time!

The interview process was pleasant throughout but it turned into a very long and drawn out process that involved three separate interviews. My first interview was with the head French professor and the division chairperson. My second interview was with the head of the Department of Modern Languages. My third interview was with the Executive Secretary to the Provost. Each stage was handled in a warm and welcoming way. When I completed the third interview I asked the Executive Secretary if my having completed the interview with her and having filled out an employment packet meant that I was hired. She told me that I was not yet hired but that she had asked me to complete the packet so that I would not have to return to do it if I were to be hired. This surprised me and I asked who was going to make the final decision about hiring me. She said that it was the division chairperson who would decide. I was surprised because I had anticipated that the interview process would be linear but it was not. It took a bit longer than I had anticipated to find out that I was hired. Apparently this is how the interview process is handled on a regular basis. This was my first time to be hired by the first person to interview me but to have two more interviews without the presence of the first interviewer. I'm sure it works well enough but it is not what I would design for an interview process.,0.82980984,0.1690721,0.0011181

The questions were pretty standard and general but not difficult. I enjoyed speaking with the committee and a couple days later I was contacted via phone to come in for an inperson interview.  The campus interview was really disorganized. I was never given a schedule of where I needed to be. I was supposed to meet with the Dean and no one ever took me to see the Dean or instructed me when or where that was supposed to happen. The classroom demo was given to students who were forced to be there for the summer and were super unhappy. There were large periods of time where I was just waiting somewhere on my own because the interview committee was so disorganized. The people I met were friendly enough and I enjoyed meeting them but to go through a 4 hour interview and be told I would be informed either way of their decision and then to never hear anything back is extremely rude  thoughtless and unprofessional on their part.

There was a 20 minute phone interview in which they asked 56 questions then three candidates were chosen for second interviews on campus. I was asked to prepare a 1015 minute presentation about my vision for the future of the writing center I was given a campus tour I met the chair of the department and I was interviewed with two faculty members. I thought I did pretty well on the presentation but I think I may have sputtered on a few of the interview questions. When it came time for my questions the faculty members who interviewed me weren't entirely sure about some details of the position such as whether it was 10 or 12 month since it was a staff position. They referred me back to the department chair if I wanted that information. Benefits were never discussed and I couldn't find thorough information on HR's website (such as number of days of leave or details about health insurance). It also wasn't clear if this was a contingent or noncontingent position.   I was told at the end of the interview that a decision would be made in about two weeks and I'd be notified either way. A month went by and I heard nothing so I sent an email to follow up and was told another candidate had been selected and accepted the position. Really? When were they planning on telling me? I liked the department chair a lot and I could tell he had the best interests of the writing center in mind so I'm sure the candidate they selected is the best suited for the position. However when someone puts time and effort into researching an institution and coming for a campus interview to give a presentation it's common courtesy to let them know ASAP about the outcome.

If you are applying externally then you will receive the typical interview process where it could be phone in person or panel interview. The disadvantage of being externally is that they may already have an internal candidate in mind and you are simply a formality for legal purposes. Internally you adhere to the same procedure except your disadvantage lies within the college staff notifying your current employer of your interview within another department whether you get hired or not; and this may hurt you more if you aren't hired because your current employer will seek retribution against you even if it's illegal they'll just find other means to get rid of you legally before you quit.,0.98400056,0.015830785,0.00016869274

Then they expected the oral presentation and handouts offering minimal feedback. Next it was a 35 page list of openended questions asked while they wrote down comments. Finally it was a timed (20minute) Excel spreadsheet problem to solve and document the results in Word or PowerPoint.

The initial phone screening was easy and inviting.  The person setting everything up was very professional although he wasn't able to answer any questions regarding the position.  The actual interview was done via online video conference and a little intimidating because I was on the other end of one of these once and your picture is generally blown up for the iaudience. I kept imagining them staring at my giant head.  The position stated that it was a lead analyst position and your job was to analyze data and help the developers create queries and apps that could be applied to the data needs of various groups.  All things I am familiar with doing.  The actual position was for a developer that would be tasked with some analyst work.  The truth is that I have't done any real developing in years.  I applied as an analyst talked about how I was an analyst but during the interview I kept getting asked these very detailed and esoteric SQL questions.  I was floored by the amount and detail of the questions I felt like I was back in school taking a test.  Normally I would be able to look anything up that I had forgotten but of course this interview wasn't open notes.  So suffice it to say that I was not called back.    It was upsetting though because I was really flustered during the interview.  It did give me some practice in online interviewing though so I can't complain too much.,0.66535205,0.33387393,0.0007740238

I got a call from HR and interviewed with them. I then interviewed with the admissions representative and was offered a inperson interview. Basically I feel like she only offered me to come in because I told her “When will I hear about next steps? Last time I applied nobody got back to me”. She then interviewed me in person and the FIRST thing she said was “A  concern I have is your lack of experience in a higher education job” like literally wtf?? I wanted to walk out and tell her why did you even interview me if you know you don’t want to hire me because of lack of experience?! I finished the interview knowing from the beginning I didn’t get the job KNOWING I didn’t even get the job because she didn’t offer me a inperson interview until I asked. It’s really just so rude she had no intentions of hiring me from the start but wanted to waste my time anyways with a interview.   For the record I was a college student last month when I was interviewed. I have an associates in business and I’m a semester away from a bachelors. I also have sales/customer service experience with a internship from HR. It’s not like I didn’t have experience but obviously a 20 year old isn’t going to have many years of experience on their hands! After this interview I am never even going to reapply to Bryant and Stratton...who starts the interview off with that? So unprofessional! Also she said she would get back to me by “next week”. I knew she wouldn’t get back to me at all got a rejection email a month later.

Applied Online and then went for group interview. After the group interview commenced met with hiring manager one on one and had interview. I received an email inviting me for a group interview. I attended the group interview and was taken back at how the hiring manager was dressed. I know it was casual Friday but impressions are everything. The hiring manager was nice but it seemed like she was looking for the perfect employee. She seemed judgmental as far as work history and she made it known you would not be getting the job. The rudest part of the interview process is taking almost three hours and not even receiving a rejection letter.,0.98850304,0.011197463,0.00029948007
Interviewed three times between the Greece and Henrietta campuses. A constant issue emerged regarding the response times from the interviewers: they all spent weeks or months before they updated you with your candidate status. It seems like if they reject you then they do not tell you so at all. You have to send a request multiple times before someone may provide feedback.,0.99742043,0.002470766,0.00010876487

This was a panel interview where everyone had the same script.  They went around the table and each asked questions that were pre determined.  It was very systematic but also was conversational.  I suppose it would depend on who the interviewers were.,0.00046446206,0.9989687,0.00056683685

"First I was asked a series of questions then I had to present a 15 minute lesson on one of 7 course outcomes. No other instructions were given.There were four people interviewing me taking turns asking questions at random. Neither Dean for the school was present at the interview. During my presentation I could see that one or two of them were drifting in and out of paying attention. No questions were asked during the presentation and it felt that I was boring them. After I was done they asked if I had any questions and sent me on my way guaranteeing that either way I'd hear back within the week (interview was on a Tuesday the following Monday I finally heard back that I wasn't selected despite having ""impressive skills"" this from one of the Dean's who as I mentioned previously was not present during the interview). Considering that the Dean's are head of the college I thought they would want to be involved in who was going to be hired but they did not.",0.9861893,0.01363438,0.00017636374

Saw the ad posted and emailed.  The Program Director emailed me and we sat down and talked. The interview itself was more of just a conversation and getting to know each other.

Questions were average ""difficulty"" but as long as you review your relevant skills/experience/strengths/weaknesses the night before you'll be fine . Interview was great but I decided halfway through that the job/company was not a good fit for memore of a sales atmosphere and didn't have growth opportunities I was looking for. At the end of the hourlong meeting the hiring manager said they would call early the following week in either case job offer or not. Never received any call but then again I didn't care for the position.",0.9936047,0.006099271,0.0002959847
Very simple process.  I had a short and informal discussion with the dean of instruction.  He asked about previous experience and interest in the position.  He also asked about my approach to classroom management.  He also spent time explaining how the college schedule worked and the types of classes available for me as an adjunct.,0.00044921247,0.9988275,0.0007232094
The interview process consisted of mostly behaviorally based questions getting to know you questions and then the opportunity to shadow someone in the job you would have.

During the behavioral questions expect multiple people to sit in the interview and also it may be hosted in a conference area.,0.001249933,0.9629363,0.03581369
Excessive. The company was and still is in disarray. Leadership is in dire need of absolute change. This is a classic example of Corporate literally stealing government funding.

They asked me to come in for a panel interview but when I arrived it was very different from what I expected.  About thirty applicants were gathered in a room and we were first given a lecture on how great Bryant & Stratton College was.  Then we were given a tour of the college and it was explained to us how we could all benefit from attending the college.  At the end of the tour the guide told us that there was a financial aid seminar with free food for us if anyone wanted to attend.  The guide actually forgot to even ask for our resumes at the end of the tour and had to be reminded by one of the applicants.  This was NOT an interview it was a scam.  They tricked people into coming in and then forced them into a highpressure sales pitch.  I am not sure that this was even a real job opening to begin with.,0.98024863,0.01848722,0.0012641278

Several interviews.  First a group interview with about 20 people then a panel interview then a oneonone with the campus director.

I had a brief interview with the head of internal events then a joint interview with her and the head of external catering. It took place in Wyndham and the fancy decor was intimidating. It's pretty much just to make sure you're going to show up for work to see how dedicated to the job you are.  Their idea is to hire the fewest number of workers for the summer so everyone gets plenty of hours.  This makes it hard for people to get shifts covered when there's an event (i.e. Bonnaroo) that everyone goes to.

There are two rounds of interviews: the first is with the HelpDesk Manager and with the Director of User Services. The interview process did not last long as it was only 15 minutes or so.

The second round of interviewing was with the Associate Vice President of Technology and Vice President for Online and Professional Studies.

Hiring manager was a consultant working out of the East Coast. We had a video chat. I appreciate that they were transparent and shared the salary right away as it was below market rate for the Bay Area.  As much as I would have loved to have done the job there is no way someone with the qualifications they were looking for could afford to live in the Bay Area on that salary.,0.9956072,0.0041678473,0.00022486542
Zoom interview with consultant from her home in New York. Very awkward. Realized immediately that I had more experience than the interviewer. Moreover I felt something was off with her and the haphazard way they were managing marketing and public relations. News releases on their website are not written in AP style and contain questionable content. I question how this consultant finagled her way into this role with CCA and it certainly raised red flags.,0.99854195,0.0013199375,0.00013805632

Quite extensive process phone screening 20 minute Skype panel interview with 3 department staffers then 3 hour on campus interview including a 10 minute presentation. This was expected during normal business hours so needed to take time off of work. Also at the in person interview I was told the salary range was substantially lower that what had originally been posted. I assumed they goofed with the original listing. The job offer allowed for minimal salary negotiation only after I had accepted the position.   At the end of the 3hour interview I was told I would need to provide 4 references requiring one to be my current supervisor. I found this to be quite a surprise as it is an obvious risk to my current position and standing with the company. When I expressed my concern the interviewee insisted that it would be required or that I would be taken out of the running.  I was pretty turned off by the experience as there were multiple unprofessional and disorganized elements of the process. For instance they were late for the meeting and the room they had scheduled was not available. I was not offered the position and they didn't bother to even send an email letting me know their final decision. Disrespectful to the time put in to go through the process.   Especially coming from the Career Development office the experience was highly unprofessional. I honestly feel sorry for students who look to this department for guidance as they go out into the world and apply for positions.,0.9987465,0.0011018066,0.00015163414

Applied online had the initial phone call with HR and then had a panel interview with 3 others while also being recorded for others to review. I've been in a number of interviews in my career and this has got to be the worst one I've ever had. I literally started getting annoyed midinterview when they were asking me questions that 1) were covered in both my resume and cover letter had they read it prior to meeting 2) answers I already discussed or covered when I talked about my background but instead of listening or having a conversation all 3 participants were looking at questions and reading from their screens. Did not make eye contact at all until finishing their question and looking up. It was just awful and I was so offended by the lack of genuine interest in a candidate they showed. They all seemed like they didn't want to be there which then made me feel uncomfortable. Never heard back but also didn't bother to followup after.,0.99885905,0.0009991762,0.0001418555

This interview was for a student position. Not the hardest interview I have ever had but it was about 3040 minutes for a parttime job! So in that case it was pretty extreme. They asked like 15 questions. They were thoughtful questions though meant to prepare students for interviews later in life. It definitely helped me later on so I guess it worked.,0.0008448972,0.99698347,0.002171582

Long draw out process. They were asking lots of question that were hypothetical. A lot of what if questions. It was uptight and it needed to be loosen up a bit. There were a lot of people that were nervous. It felt really hot because the A/C wasn't turn on. They did call us one on one for a second interview. The one thing that I learned is that you must be confident in yourself and let them know what you can bring to the table.,0.9863382,0.013433235,0.00022858154
2 different interviews both in person with travel costs covered.  First interview panel was very friendly and engaged with a wide range of questions.

The hiring and interview processes are fair. They pay candidates' travel expenses for interviews  including meals. Interviewees meets with a panel of department faculty the dean the provost and a group of students. I was asked about my past teaching experiences research service and problematic situations. The dean was most interested in my research.

My first interview was a phone screen with the HR Department. This was a very basic 30 minute phone call asking about my qualifications. The second was a final interview about 2 hours long with 4 panel teams of 34 people. The second interview was very intense but it gave me a great idea of how the position was viewed across multiple departments at the College.

Brief interview asking about administrative experience and goals for working in the department.  Very conversational and friendly.

Fairly standard process. I was contacted by a recruiter for a brief phone screen then moved on to a Zoom interview with the department manager.  Clearly they did not see me as the right fit which is fine but after several weeks I've yet to hear back from anybody in the company after reaching out to multiple individuals regarding whether there would be next steps.

I had an interview scheduled with Rae Moon from Strategic Education. She asked four questions pertaining to the job. I felt that the questions and conversation went well. It actually went so well that she stated that she would follow up early the following week. I followed up with my interview by sending an email saying that I was happy to be considered for the position. She never responded to that email. One day went by and I heard nothing. The second day went by and I heard nothing.  On day three I sent an email following up on my application status and she did not respond. I called on the fourth day and I received no answer. It has been one week with no response by email or phone. I am okay with not being selected for the position if that is the case. I am not okay with being told that they would follow up all to not hear one word. I have no idea what the issue is but I am not happy with how this process transpired.

Carrington Stockton was an impressive place to interview.  I was immediately given the impression that they cared for their students and staff.  The Campus President had answers for my questions which demonstrated effective leadership.  The phone interview which preceded the on site interview was not as intimidating as I thought it would be.  Everyone I spoke with from the appointment scheduler to the interviewers were professional and pleasant.  I was pleased with the clear approach to the process.  Every interaction ended with an explanation of the next step.  It is a long process but they are very professional and upfront about it.,0.0009898726,0.005708086,0.9933021

It was a lengthy process starting with talent acquisition then finally meeting the marketing team. There was a series of phone calls/interviews and two halfday long inperson interviews.

The next week spoke to two people who work closely with this position. They gave me a very different description of what they were looking for.   I had prepared according to what HR had told me and tried to talk about those points most in my interview which the people I interviewed with didn't like.

Was great until meeting department head who obviously was bent on proving his opinion by annoyingly reiterating questions which quickly became interrogatory he became even more annoying at the mention of my state license in the field and excellency certs which he apparently lacked. By Third interview was clear he's afraid of anyone with more experience credentials and teaching ability.. he asked questions which anyone with real world experience would know can't be answered by a text book. I immediately declined to continue as there was no way I'd ever work under anyone like that and feel sorry for anyone who has no choice. The fact that someone like that was unofficially over a department and allowed to conduct final interviews alone also showed me that it was more the company than him as he was holding on to what was likely one of few dwindling career options. Don't waste your time unless you have no other choices,0.9977423,0.0020696688,0.00018799074

After submitting my application I was contacted via email to set up an initial Skype interview. The initial interview took place per the agreedupon date & time. The young woman in Utah who conducted the interviewed was very pleasant and professional. The interview lasted approximately 20 minutes after which time I was told I'd be contacted (via email) for a followup/secondary interview with another individual in management. The next interview was arranged as before and a new date & time set. This time however I received a phone call at the designated hour from the woman with whom I was supposed to interview; she explained that she worked remotely from home and was experiencing disruptions due to maintenance testing of the fire/CO2 alert system at her residence which resulted in a loud alarm going off at frequent intervals. She apologized and requested to reschedule the Skype interview. I understood of course and we rescheduled the interview for the following day at 5 PM my time. The next day I waited at my laptop my cell phone at my side from 4:30 to 5:45 but she never called either by Skype or phone. I checked my email in the meantime but no message. In the days that followed I did not receive any followup emails or phone calls from anyone at Charter College to clarify or explain the situation. I let it go as I felt it might well be indicative of a lack of professional organization communication and/or integrity and was sure I didn't want to work with a management team that wasn't able to demonstrate these core characteristics within the interview process.,0.9807016,0.01896057,0.00033770665

The process began with an email from a very pleasant and helpful corporate recruiter named Arde.  I can't say enough good things about how helpful Arde was during this entire process.  After finishing the application taking an initial vocation/personality test I had a phone interview with Arde which went relatively well.  Following the phone interview I was emailed five questions to answer regarding the position what I had learned about the College and how I planned to meet the goals and objectives of being an AR at Charter.  The final step was an inperson interview with Jill whose job title I believe was Operations Manager.  Good luck finding the office though as it was poorly labeled tucked away all neatly among many other nonrelated businesses and isn't even called Charter College ... but that's another issue entirely.    Jill was also nice and her questions were pretty straight forward about the job and how I would be able to meet the very rigid quota system they had established.  I got the very distinct impression through Jill's questions however that the goal of this position had very little to do with what was best for the student.  This is a position geared more towards the used car salesmen sector than it is a typical Admissions Representative role.  If you care about students and want to help them make decisions that will actually benefit their lives look at one of the many other local colleges and universities in the area. If you can sell a used convertible during a rain storm however you will do just fine here.,0.011879413,0.95123905,0.036881495
There wasn't much to the interview. They simply asked a few basic questions asked for any certifications and offered me the job about 3 days later. I assume they did a background check. I was provided materials for the job on the first day or shortly thereafter,0.00036317695,0.9991265,0.0005103221

For this work study the interview was given in daily interaction. I am often found in the library studying. Charter College provides an IT lab and the instructor operates a nonprofit organization. It is important to have utmost integrity even though this is an entrylevel position. The WYSIWYG applies. There is a delay in regards to background check and verification with the Department of Education. If there is no answer to being hired be patient. The delay is not in the supervisor or the career development specialist.,0.95158046,0.047313564,0.0011059848
I filled out an online application and completed an assessment test that took almost an hour so be prepared to spend time on it.  The next day I was contacted via email by the recruiter (Arde) to complete a questionnaire for their sales position.  This one was only took about 20 minutes and I received a copy of the results which was cool.  Two days later I was contacted again by the same recruiter for a telephone interview and it was arranged for the next day.  The call took about 40 minutes and I was asked a lot of questions about sales my sales style overcoming objections being comfortable in a quota environment and working in a short sales cycle.  The recruiter spent the first several minutes stating all the requirements of the position the company and the hiring process which was nice because I had the information up front but then I didn't have a lot of questions to ask at the end because they had already been answered.    The next morning I received a no thank you email from the recruiter (Arde),0.0040325653,0.9880498,0.0079176305
You will submit your resume and then take an online test that will qualify or disqualify you immediately! It is the Biggs test. You don't need an associates or any degree to get a job here!

I submitted an online application with the online assessments. They were pretty time consuming test. It took me about 1.5 hours to complete. I was contacted within 3 days by Arde a corporate recruiter. We arranged a phone interview. I prepared for the phone interview and to my surprise Arde never called! She sent me a email about 10 minutes after our scheduled phone interview to reschedule. I thought this was highly unprofessional but I agreed to reschedule. The phone interview went well. We spent about 30 minutes focusing on why choose a career in sales and what do you know about their school.  I went on to the next interview with the director of admissions. He informed me before the interview started that the position had been filled and there was a mistake on their part. We proceeded with a quick meeting/interview since I was there already. He implied that that interview would be considered if another position that met my qualifications opened. Overall I was glad I didn't get the position. My first impression of the company was there was something very shady going on. Be aware of first impressions.,0.8255824,0.1739057,0.00051186414

I applied online Sunday night. I was emailed to take a 1hour assessment test online. The assessment took over an hour as it consisted of extremely advanced math questions (i.e. algebraic equations ratios and word problems) English (i.e. mainly analogies and word comprehension) and selfassessment questions (i.e. basically rating yourself on various topics) which I aced! I was contacted by Arde a corporate recruiter for the company to complete TWO ADDITIONAL assessments online. One assessment was in complex math (which was timed) and the other assessment was a selfquestionnaire. After I completed all the unnecessary assessments Arde contacted me to set up a phone interview. She conducted a 3040 minute long phone interview which I aced! I was then set up to meet with the Director of Admissions and Campus President a few days later. I arrived 45 minutes early to the interview (just wanted to be on time) and ended up waiting 30 minutes past my scheduled interview. I was a bit pissed because that is very unprofessional. Neither the President nor the Director of Admissions came out to say they were sorry. Once I finally was invited to interview in the President’s office I was hounded with questions left and right WITH NO TIME TO THINK. I would barely finish answering a question with one person and the next person would fire off another question. It went that way for a good 3035 minutes and I was absolutely exhausted. The whole interview felt very unprofessional and ruthless. Both the President and Director of Admissions were cold inconsiderate and misleading. Even after all that I still felt I aced the interview! Well the next day I received an ambiguous email from Arde (the recruiter) that they will be moving forward with other candidates that more closely fit the position. AT THIS POINT I AM SO PISSED THAT it took me a while to realize: I AM TOO GOOD FOR THEM. I don’t need to work in such a negative and unprofessional environment and horrible management team. All in all the whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth.,0.9971962,0.0025789104,0.00022487919
I had initially interviewed for the enrollment processor position a couple of years ago with Arde out of Vegas a corporate recruiter. She did not pass me on and the interview questions were standard but she seemed disinterested. I interviewed again recently in 2013 with Ash another corporate recruiter for the Education Loan Specialist Position and he was very good with his interviewing and thoroughly engaged with everything I had to say and referred me on to the Regional Financial Aid Director. She had a great attitude and seemed completely impressed with me and referred me onto the President of the College. The President was a very nice man and said that I  must have impressed them to make it that far and it was his job to see that I would be a good fit and told me that he felt I would be but had to discuss with the CEO and would get back to me in a week. Two days later the recruiter sent a pat email that the position had been cancelled but to apply for other open positions. I applied for the Admissions Representative position and again had an interview with Arde from Vegas. She tried to say that the reps had been there for a long time and they were mature. She asked me to describe what I thought the student population was like and she informed me that I described it well and she asked me to tell her how I would be relatable to them. I thought I described it well enough but during the interview process she seemed completely disinterested in me again just like the first time. At the end I asked her if she had any concerns with my abilities and she said tell you what you can take another assessment and then if your results are ok I will refer you on. Well the first assessment I took the other recruiter told me that my results were very good and it looked like the kind of person the college wanted but this time I just got a pat email from Arde that they would be pursuing other applicants so after three tries with this company and getting a disinterested recruiter and a job cancel and even having the President tell me he thinks I am a good fit but the recruiters just pass on me I don't get it. My family told me to forget about this company because they were just wasting my time.,0.30006146,0.697825,0.0021135695

The interviews were lengthy and very thorough. I applied online and was immediately sent a long online assessment. I then was directed to HR for a phone interview followed with a face to face interview.  At the interview I had the opportunity to sit for an extended amount of time with the campus president and then had a second interview with the Director of Admissions who flew in to meet me. The company had just offered the position to someone else a week prior and recommended me two weeks later to a position in Career Services which surprisingly was a perfect match for me!,0.02013131,0.95732445,0.022544224
Applied through CareerBuilder.  Next contacted by email to take a 1 hour assessment test online.  I was then contacted by an inhouse recruiter to try and dissuade me from the job as I was overqualified.  Discussed the fact that most companies will get more than they paid for due to the abysmal job market.  She set up an interview with the 'president' of the online campus.  I was told by the recruiter not to be surprised if the interview started to lean towards the director position (in reality a sales manager).  Met with 'president' of the online school and we immediately decided I was way over qualified for the position but my background fit into their growth plans from a marketing and business development standpoint.  We discussed a number of ideas to assist in the growth of their business (amounted to free consulting) and she would push my name and credentials up the ladder as they had an executive meeting the next day.  She said she would get back to me.  Nothing......  Sent 2 followup emails outlining our conversation highlighting areas of greatest return on investment and my willingness to assist.  Not even the courtesy of a response.  What I learned from this boiler room educational company is that they fit in well with the continued degeneration of education in the state as well as the country.,0.9975534,0.002286801,0.0001598578

"The process was frustrating.  I submitted my information as requested.  I then had to follow up by among other things calling their national headquarter in Nevada.  After getting a runaround for several weeks I was given two telephone screens.  Since I made the grade I was then given a battery of online tests.  I passed them successfully.  I then was brought in to the office for an interview with the Admissions Director.  An interview that lasted over an hour and a half.  Things looked promising.  I was called in for a followup interview with the president.  That interview started with the basic ""Tell me what you know about our company.""  So trite.  It went downhill from there.  I did not feel a connection with the President at all.    I had been told that they were anxious to get someone in the position ASAP.  Everything looked like a ""go.""  Then after waiting for a week I called the office to find out the status of my interviews.  No response.  They had highlighted in the interview how much they valued followup.  I called again and again received no response.    I eventually received a call from the HR Manager who was based in their Nevada office.  She said that the Admissions Director was no longer with the company and that they would no longer be pursuing employment with me.  She apologized that she couldn't give me additional information or feedback on my interviews.  So after successfully passing their tests and being through numerous interviews I did not get the job.

I applied via email and by mail.  A coworker had a connection to get my resume to the hiring manager who was the director of the Graduate school of management. I prepared by learning as much as I could about Clark and about the GSOM office and what they offered. I prepared questions based on the job description.   I was told my my friend that they thought I was over qualified and that I would have to convince them that I would stay in the role for some time.  I think the reason that I did not get the role is that I am currently interning as a career advisor and the director did not think I really would be happy with an adminstrative role.

A few months later when I was working at a different company a coworker mentioned he had interviewed at Colby as well. He was moving to the area and was promised the position before moving.

Submitted the application materials online.  In about a week I received an email requesting a phone interview.  A couple of days later I got another email inviting me to the campus. The campus interview was scheduled on two weeks  from that day (later it turned out that I was the last  who visited the campus).   Had a dinner with two faculty the day I flew in.  The next day I met with a few people did a teaching demonstration at 3pm and an interview with the search committee at 4pm.  The long day finally ended at 5pm.   Before I left I was told that the decision would be made in a week.  However I didn't hear anything until 3 weeks later.

Very thorough interview process.

I first received a call to schedule the interview with the search committee. It was about 30min and it was a phone interview. The committee members took turns to ask questions and they left few minutes for me to ask questions as well. All members sounded nice.

"Applied through an agency designed to help disabled individuals find employment. The application did not allow me to self identify as disabled but did allow me to say where I found the job posting; which indicates whoever reviewed my application was aware of my disability. Nowhere in the hiring process did they ask about if I needed any accommodations in fairness their website does indicate that you may ask for accommodations however this is not applicable as I did not apply through their website directly.  I was contacted by someone in human resources about a week after applying to ask for a word document describing my work experience. Despite already turning in a resume with my work experience listed under two bold headers of ""EMPLOYMENT"" and ""EXPERIENCE"" I followed through and sent a more expanded explanation in a word document.  Another week passes I get a phone call from the same person in human resources asking me how much of a salary I would be willing to take. They explain that they want me to agree to a salary before going through the process any further because ""they don't want to waste to much time."" I ask about what the benefits are for this position before I agree on a salary they tell me to look on their website and that if I want to be a candidate for this position I have to make a decision by tomorrow. As I explained already I had never been on Colgate's employment website as I applied through an agency. So I was not able to find a link to the benefits for this position and had to send an email asking for a direct link. I received a response the next day with a direct link but felt extremely rushed into making a decision.   Approximately one week later I get a phone call from the manager for this position. They inform me that they would like to schedule a oneonone phone interview next week; I schedule an interview. When I receive the call I am immediately intimidated by the fact that four people are on the phone line. Normally I would have asked for an accommodation to handle a situation like this due to my disability at the very least a warning that it was going to be more than one person would have helped me immensely particularly since I clarified it was going to be a conversation with one person.  I was already intimidated by the interview due to the mix up involving how many people would be on the line. However the answer to the first question they asked me made me even more intimidated. They asked me ""Why are interested in working at Colgate University and academia in general?"" As I said already I am disabled and looking for an employer willing to understand the difficulties of this situation. So my attempt at acknowledging this without directly saying that was ""When I apply to an institution I try to find somewhere that has values similar to my own. I was looking at Colgate's mission statement and particularly enjoyed your commitment to inclusiveness and diversity."" The response to this was ""You do realize that this is a job at the bookstore and not the university?"" This shocked me. In essence they revealed to me that the bookstore does not have the same values as the university.  As for the rest of interview it was difficult to hear the interviewers on the speaker phone at times. I'm not sure why they didn't have individual phones on a conference call or at the very least sit in close proximity to the phone they were speaking into. Most of the questions were aimed at business experience which I did not have much of as my resume education and work experience already indicated. Strangely the job posting didn't even mention this was what they were looking for and had far more of an emphasis on the graphic art/design side.  After the interview I did not hear back from them for another month. I received a generic response from a generic HR email telling me I was no longer in consideration. At the very least I would have liked to have heard back from the same person I spoke with in HR for the duration of two months.",0.9964952,0.0033512001,0.00015364641

"Strangest interview process I've ever been a part of.  2 months after applying I receive an email that the position was still open and they will be contacting me to discuss an interview. A week or so afterwards I received an email asking to schedule a time for a 15 minute phone interview. 15 minute interview?! That's barely enough time to have a quick discussion about the position itself and my background.  I proceeded and scheduled the interview and was informed via email that it was a round table interview with a ""committee"". I was also supplied a list of thought provoking questions in preparation for the 15 minute interview. When the phone interview started there was no introduction to the position nor an opportunity to talk about my background so they could get a sense of who I was and where I came from. Instead each person fired off a generic question (tell us a time where you did this tell me about your leadership style etc). One after the other. Then after the last person had their question the hiring manager closed the interview basically shutting down any opportunity for me to ask a question and indicating that if I had any questions about the position I could send him an email. There was still even time left in the 15 minutes but the interview was still ""shut down"" by the hiring manager. Please realize that not only are you interviewing us but we are interviewing you as well. The job posting was vague and generic from the beginning so I would have assumed the first interview would be a general introduction to both the position and my qualifications. Afterwards if it seemed like I was a good fit and the position was a good fit for me  we could schedule a round table interview (longer than 15 minutes). All in all it was a very strange and ineffective interview process.

Since I had moved to LA and was contemplating coming back to SF she went on to say that I wasn't aware of the level of traffic and busyness of the City.   She made it clear that she thought I just could not handle having energy or a city (though I was in L.A.) It was just weird.  It was 100% clear that she just thought I was too old to do the job.  Super weird experience.  Oh well went on to run four divisions of a school in the middle east my own nonprofit and ran a 5k to boot.  Had just been looking for an interim gig to contribute while I was in the US. I was very qualified.  I have never had an experience like that before or since.",0.6741515,0.32543075,0.00041776442
First there was a phone call then a video interview where you stimulate a weekly coaching call where other coaches pretend to be students. There was a lack of consistency with instruction. the email said I had x amount of time the interviewer said completely different instructions.

The initial inperson interview was informative and it provided a tour of the site. However the first outreach emails regarding interviewing lacked detail and to be quite honest professionalism. The following takehome assignment was disorganized disconnected and had broken links. It was framed as a data project but contained absolutely no data to work from or touched on using data in the least. After reaching out about the broken links and being told they weren't needed which was likely untrue I attempted the assignment anyway providing extensive detail and what data points would support the project. If the takehome was any indication of how the team and site were run then they are in need of some serious attention to detail. I never heard back after completing the assignment which again is unprofessional considering that I was ton I was one of 7 candidates being considered out of 200 applicants. I had also been asked to participate in the next round of interviews at my initial interview but got zero follow up.,0.99762934,0.0022338463,0.00013685937

I had to complete a 1question scenariobased assessment. Afterward I was scheduled for an hour interview with the manager. It was a panel interview which was fine with me. However one of the individuals in the panel was rude and lackluster. She didn’t even give me the chance to elaborate on my knowledge and skills and gave me strange looks. I did not feel I was overqualified for the position. The interview was less than 30 minutes which was disappointing and somewhat insulting for the type of position I applied to. The manager in the panel promised she would followup with me. It’s been more than 3 weeks and I got no response. The manager went ghost and did not provide me an update. No response “IS” a response. If they leave candidates hanging dry like this they will do the same to employees on the job.

The Dean of their business school asked me a job candidate (not a paid employee) to find out the cost of living in Denver area for several years so he could lobby the President to increase their salary because “faculty salary increases have NOT kept pace with Denver Metro’s COL.” (COL is the cost of living).

None of the entire business faculty members know how perform this simple task—the homework problem I assign to my own undergraduate business students.  2.

Basic questions for academic advising.  Three part interview process.  First you are contacted by a talent acquisition rep who does an initial screening via phone.  They will ask you a few simple questions to ensure you understand the job description and overall forprofit culture of the company. Within a week or two you will be contacted by a manager to schedule an inperson interview.  Interview itself takes about an hour.  Managers in student advising are fairly casual and prefer a conversation over an indepth interview.  If you make it to the third phase you will be contacted via phone by the Director of Student Advising or the VP of the university for an impromptu final interview.  Much more of a formal interview compared to the one with the managers which is odd given it is not a scheduled item.  If the Director/VP is satisfied with your answers they will contact the talent acquisition rep who will extend an offer.

I never write reviews but I could not pass on this.... I arrived for my interview 10 minutes early.  Scheduled for 9:00 a.m.  (I was called to schedule this interview the day before and this was the only time option I was given) I sat and waited in the lobby.  I watched the staff go in and out.  During that time most of them acknowledged me.  At approx. 9:10 a.m. the receptionist guides me Behind the Front Desk to take a “test.”  The test seemed simple.  While taking the test there were several conversations upfront including the receptionist and one of the staff members came over to me and introduced himself & shook my hand.  I said hello & explained I was taking a test.  Then at 9:20 a.m. the receptionist states my time is up.  I explained to him I had no idea I was being timed. Then I was escorted to the conference room of a panel of 6 people.  I was highly skilled for the position and dressed as a career person should be for an interview.  I felt as if they did not think I would stay there long because of my experience.  If they felt that I was over qualified and would not stay why would they call me for an interview to come in the next day.  I was very interested in the small location the position and learning more about the team.  It is unfortunate that the people who are interviewing are not trained to do so.   I guess that is why it is taking them 6 months to fill the position.  It was last minute and a complete waste of my time.  They disrespected my time.

"I Applied back in the September 2015..I actually forgotten that I had applied at this place through indeed I got a call from the admissions rep she asked if I could come in for an interview.I interviewed in November 2015. Went to the interview and it lasted almost 2 hrs I though it went really well the school director was very personable during the interview It felt like I had the job since it went so well. Unfortunately interviewing with the school director made it a bit confusing now that I think about it she almost made it seemed like I was in we even went into a personal convo while I was there. Anyway 2 days passed and she called me back for a second interview(even though she had said initially she wasn't going to do second interviews) last minute the same day I got the call. So I went in and interviewed with the school director and an admission rep. It seemed odd the admissions rep was doing most of the talking while on the second interview ultimately I was like Ok whatever i went along. After the second interview they said ""we will let you know the status eitherway"". 4 days passed and nothing I ended up emailing/calling and the school director  i was told she was not in..I wanted  to know what the status was because i was interested in the position. Long story when I called the ppl that answered the phone they gave me the run around which I though was disorganized  and unprofessional just because they said they were going to do something and they didn't. It doesn't take long for someone to email ""the position has been filled"" ok cool now I can move on... although  when I had called they were like ""call back tomorrow"" so I called ""oh she not here again I'll pass the message expect a call in 2 days"". blah blah blah!!

"I applied for the position in November 2014. I was contacted in early December for an interview. The interview went very well (or so I thought). It was an interview with three individuals including an HR recruiter the Corporate Outreach supervisor and a Corporate Outreach representative. The interview was about an hour long. I was told that the position would not start until January because of the upcoming holidays and that I would hear back sometime then. I immediately sent out my thank you letters and a week after my interview I received an email saying the position had been closed. I contacted the HR recruiter that was present at my interview since she advised me to contact her with any questions I may have. When I asked her if the position was permanently closed or they had decided to hire someone else she simply responded ""The position has been closed"" with no detailed information. Fine.   First week of February I notice the position had opened up again. I was still very interested in the position so I went ahead and sent an email to the HR Recruiter asking if I should resubmit an application or if my previous application would be considered. After two days of not hearing back I decided on my own to resubmit my application.   Early March I was sent one of those generic emails thanking me for my application but they were pursuing other candidates etc. This really soured my entire experience with Columbia Southern. I had such a pleasant interview and genuinely liked everyone but it was so unprofessional for the HR Recruiter to not have the common courtesy to return my email. All she had to say was that I was not what they were looking for. I found it so ironic that I applied to a position where communication was key and yet there was a complete lack of communication when it came to my application.

"I read a previous interview review from someone who applied to work in this area (Alumni Affairs) that said ""As far as overall reactions go I was alarmed by a lack of diversity seeing that everyone I encountered in that office or on the team was a white woman aged between 4060.

I applied to this position and was emailed for an interview about a week later for a Zoom interview. The person who interviewed me seemed generally extremely uninterested and skeptical of me (asking me what felt like leading questions about how this might not be a role for me despite my background in Development?) and was not easy to connect with at all.

It comprised of a 4 hour interview process with the staff I would oversee senior leadership an open forum with campus community members and then a oneonone with a VP. All of which were extremely pleasant and informal. The issue I had is the lack of transparency and communication from either the VP and AnotherSource on the outcome of the interview process. This VP talked of communication openness and trust worthy and yet she perpetuates the culture by which she was proposing to change and this rubs me the wrong way by saying one thing and doing another.

"The application and interview process was a six month ordeal (I applied in late March 2015 and received a rejection email in late September). The interview was conducted in midJune.  All the members of the search committee were friendly and professional.  I also appreciated how well the search committee’s chair kept me updated throughout her portion of the process. The interview consisted of a panel interview with the search committee followed by a 15minute presentation to an open forum group and then a meeting with the hiring manager.  The hiring manager informed me that he was retiring at the end of the following month and he wanted the person for this position to start before he left.  Early the next month the chair informed me that I was the person that the search committee was going to recommend. The search committee chair checked my references and received approval from the hiring manager  and the university President.    An interim hiring manager came on board in early August before an offer was extended to me . The new manager wanted to interview me which was certainly this person's prerogative.  The manager began the interview by telling me that I was one of two finalists which I found surprising and disturbing since the search committee chair never told me that it was between me and another candidate.  The manager did not provide a timeline for the decision process.  I tried following up with this person at least four times via email since we met and only ne of my emails was responded to wherein I was informed me that they were in the process of “deliberating” and that I would be notified when a decision had been made.    The ""notification"" came six weeks later in the form of a systemgenerated rejection email  informing me that the hiring department had “decided to cancel this recruitment.”  The same position was posted the following day!

"Overall this one of the single worst interview processes I have ever experienced. I believe that interviews are a reflection of company culture and if my experience is at all typical  RUN. Do not apply for a job here.  1) I applied for a different position and was shortly notified that while that position was not a fit they had another job for which they were ""very excited"" about me as a candidate. They asked me to apply so I did. 2) The first interview was a one way video recording  awkward but manageable. And online platform present questions you answer them on video and the recording is sent to the hiring manager. 3) Within days I am invited for a 2nd interview. I was contacted on a Friday morning  the interview was planned for Monday afternoon. 4)For this they asked me to prepare a 15 minute presentation on a marketing plan for their business. It is not easy to write a marketing plan for a business based only on outside knowledge. I spent at least 10 hours researching writing and preparing a presentation (the entire weekend  since I only had 2 days notice on the interview).5) The interview is a video call and of the 5 people on the panel only two of them had the decency to turn on their cameras. The hiring manager did not even have his camera on. Insulting and unprofessional. 6) I receive a follow up a few days later requesting ""letters of recommendation"". This was an odd request that I have not received from any other company. I told the HR person I would need to request those from my contacts and then sent 4 letters within a few days.7) I received NO acknowledgment that my letters had been received until I followed up a week later. At that time I was told that I would hear from them withing the next week. 8) Nothing. No calls no contact. Its been over 2 months and they simply ghosted me.  Utter B.S. if you ask me. I understand if I am not the right fit for the job not hurt feelings here. But TELL me that. When you ask a candidate to put in as much work as I did for an interview process you owe them the basic human courtesy of a follow up.  I strongly advise future applicants to avoid this company. The way they treat candidates is unacceptable and not a good indication that they would treat employees any better.",0.9974995,0.002230484,0.00026992473
A virtual interview. Questions were kind of pointless and tricky but not the worst interview. It's a very impersonal hiring process and the software has a lot of setup required to do the virtual interview. You also only get one attempt per question as compared to other places who usually let you have at least one redo to record.,0.9983076,0.0015175871,0.00017476316
Preliminary screening begins with a video interview then they schedule a live panel interview and it ends with a cultural interview with VP or above. The process is complete very quickly and you will start your job 24 weeks from the offer date.,0.043879095,0.95495063,0.0011702208

Started off like a normal process. Screening call with HR and then moved on the Mock Interview. They give you tools to prepare but it's still nerve wracking with no training. From there you move to panel interview which is an hour long where they learn more about your experience and how you handle situations. Before this you also have a mock email response you have to write up and afterwards an online assessment. Then a final 1530 minute video interview with the Director. Generally it was a very pleasant experience till the end. They told I'd hear back by a date and 24 hours after that passed I emailed them to check in. No response for over 24 hours. 6 hours after that I got what seems to be an automated email saying they moved forward with a different candidate. It was a very extensive process and required a lot of preparation and effort. I have nothing negative to say about that; however they fact that it took so long for them to respond to me at the end of these 6 weeks where I dedicated my time to preparing for these steps to get an automated response was honestly very frustrating. It feels a little disrespectful after I put in all this time.,0.9933767,0.006307094,0.0003163225
Two versions: video and team. They could not get their online skills test to work so it was never administered. Overall seems more like daily crisis management than an organized and productive workflow. Interview team brings laptops to the interview and they surreptitiously message one another back and forth during the meeting. Suspect there was age discrimination going on. Have also read some pretty negative reviews of this organization on Glassdoor so not completely sure about the good health of the culture there. Lesson learned: don't ignore the red flags and there seem to be a quite a few of them here.,0.9974431,0.0024130596,0.00014388404
I interviewed via telephone and did a final inperson panel interview. Their expectations were unrealistic and they did not have much to offer applicants. The pay was mediocre for the expectations they had. They also were terrible at providing a decent interviewing climate. They really need to get it together. They are definitely not a company I would recommend.,0.9985065,0.0013076712,0.00018580515
Very extensive interview process that consisted of 1 phone interview (45 minutes) 1 performance management project phone call review/scoring (45 minutes) 3 inperson panel interviews (6090 minutes in length) Cultural interview (30 minutes) and performance assessment (1 hour). I have never had to endure such an extensive interview process.,0.9984659,0.0013890101,0.0001451272
The interview process was very indepth from start to finish. CSUGlobal had some issues when they hired enrollment counselors that were new the job without enough explanation of how involved the position was so they have since learned their lesson and created a better interview process to make sure they were bringing in the right fit for their school and this position. I had four interviews total including a prequalification call a mock phone call a Zoom interview with the Director of Enrollment and another colleague and a Zoom meeting with the Senior Director of Enrollment Management.   CSUGlobal has a bad rap on Glassdoor and I went into these interviews very skeptical. But they met me head on and owned the issues that they had in the past. Admissions is a fastpaced environment and it requires the right fit especially for a remote position. They made expectations VERY clear and made sure that I knew what I would be held accountable for before even offering me the position. I have had interviews in the past that barely covered the actual job before offering me the position and that resulted in a bad outcome! Had I not been offered the opportunity to work remotely at my current position I would have accepted this position with CSUGlobal wholeheartedly. Everyone I met with was sincere proud of their work and transparent. I was blunt and outspoken about the issues I read about online and that not only did NOT deter them from hiring me but actually made them respect me more as a potential employee.,0.9946768,0.0050699785,0.0002531095
Its an exhaustive process that can take in excess of 56 weeks before any affirmative decision is heard. Here is the general sequence of events:  Submit Application > HR Reaches Out/Determines Interest > Mock Scenario Call/Exercise > Panel Interview (23 People)> IQ/Personality Assessment > Phone Interview with Executive Management  The mock scenario consists of them sending you information and resources prior to a mock call scenario. Essentially someone will call you pretending to be a student and you a enrollment counselor. You will be asked questions and must show good salesmanship as well as confidence in your answers. Make sure you review all the resources and links they send you.  All other aspects of the interview process are straightforward typical interview components. Upon completing the final interview with executive management you will thanked for your time and advised that a decision will be made.   Overall my experience with the process wasn't pleasant. For such a lengthy process their HR department needs to improve communications with applicants. I was told several times I would hear something by this day or that day but never would I receive timely notification by the deadline they provided. It really is discouraging throughout the process.,0.9971552,0.0026811936,0.00016352494
What a mess. After reading all the reviews on here and looking at some of the previous employees I am thankful I have dodged a bullet. First off the interview process is very out dated with a 5 steps to get hired. First you have a HR interview then a phone call with a  manager to try and enroll a student93045 mins long) then a video interview with 23 managers or directors( hour long) then an assessment then a campus president interview.  At first I was just going to let all of this slide and be a good person and try and get through this process. Let me remind you the position I was interviewing for was a remote position yet the questions I was being asked had nothing to do with working from home or being able to help a student through the process of getting there education. CSU has a a grading scale they use on the interviews where you have to get 85% or you do not move forward. I was told this has never failed them  but It seems with all the turn over and people not happy with the company the culture is the biggest issue. A score should not define ones ability to work for a company but maybe have some ability to spot some talent and not be lazy and revert to some score or game. My 10 years of education I was willing to take to CSU but they sent some typo driven email to me saying they have went with other candidates for the jobs.  maybe have a little more ability to spot talent and pick it rather then use some system that is filled with many holes and disadvantages for the University. I was passionate excited talented and ready to be a CSU global employee but never got the chance to. Focus on core values abilities character traits and use some Gut feeling.,0.9944981,0.005278904,0.00022301618
I was called just to see if I would be interested in an interview and I was.  I was then told that I would be contacted by the end of the following week either way.  I never heard from anyone.

I was asked to present on my vision for the center and they said I had good ideas and good ideas don't tend to sit on the shelf at CSU Global.  Whatever that means.

I had been brought on as a contractor which is how CSUG hires engineers so there was no interview to speak of before my full time hire.

At the end I asked them to explain the daytoday further and I asked more questions about what I would be doing.

Hiring begins when you fill out a standard DBU application. The Information Technology dept. requires students to submit the application personality test results class schedule unofficial transcript and resume to the Support office.   I was interviewed by 4 separate staff members over the 4 weeks after my submission.  The first interview was with 2 members of Support staff.

The second interview was with the associate vice president of the department. He was very relaxed and encouraging. He wanted to know my background and what I enjoyed about school and things of this sort. He was friendly and helped the interview feel stress free.  The third and final interview was with the vice president of the department. This was the most difficult interview since he is kind but difficult to read. I was fairly relaxed until he started asking hypothetical questions about my personality test including one question that was phrased as though there was a correct answer.

The interview process started with a phone interview and moved on to in person interviews. The whole process took about 4 months. They have a very slow hiring process. The panel of interviewers was made up of the security manager and then people from other departments. Most of the questions that were asked did not pertain to anything security related. Instead they spent most of the time asking questions about diversity and scenario based questions that are mostly common sense. They also were very big on what you already knew about the university to see if you bothered to look over their website.,0.99782217,0.002039097,0.00013871446
Application process was a bit painful compared to other companies I have worked for.  Interview was pretty standard with Dean of the campus and Career Services head as well as a few department heads.  They asked the standard interview questions regarding what qualifies me for the position and what I could bring to the team.  Over all a pretty cookie cutter experience after getting past the application process which was a little overbearing with extensive use of personality tests.  Yes tests.

I thought I did well and the interviewer said they would be in touch the following Monday with next steps for inperson interviews. That was about a month and a half ago. I sent a thankyou note immediately after the interview then I followed up the following week since I never heard back as promised. Still nothing.

Probably the worst interview experience I’ve been apart of.  The head of the department emailed me a day or two before the times she gave me to meet.

The inperson interview was very formal: the panel (56 people if I recall correctly) supplied me with a list of questions that they would ask me during the interview as well as a packet explaining my job role and the benefits package. Most of the interviewers were cordial and professional but two of them soured my experience. One was IT/Networking faculty who stared at me with aggressive and wide open eyes and an otherwise neutral facial expression throughout the interview and was combative about an answer even when it was appropriate and clearly communicated. It appears that they chose to promote someone internally who he already had experience with which makes me suspect that my interview may have been a sham and that he was providing me with a context clue.  The HR employee was rude and unprofessional throughout the entire process. She showed little interest and patience in helping me with any questions and her goodbye at the end of the interview was terse and aggressive. Why not at least ask me if I knew how to get back to where I parked? Again I have my doubts that I had a fair shot at being hired.

I applied for an IT position at one of DelTech's campuses after searching their website for career opportunities. Despite multiple emails on my end I received no response from them regarding my candidacy until three months later (at this point I had chalked it up as a loss). Nevertheless I was excited for a chance to interview for the job. I arrived and went through a fairly simple 30 minute panel interview process that I thought I did very well on. The head of the panel thanked me at the conclusion and informed me that I would be contacted within two weeks regarding the position. Another month went by and finally I was contacted and asked for them to contact my references and inform me that I was selected for a second round of interviews.

Overall the interview process is very formal structured and intimidating. It's a hiring panel of a handful of people who interview you. Most interviewers are hard to read in terms of how they feel about you and in fact appear neutral when you answer (some merciful panel members will nod once in awhile but that's rare). Interviews are not conversational but just a question and answer quickfire (you answer each question and then move on to the next); no room or time for chitchat or more informal/friendly discussion.

"The hiring process is generally by search committee. As a result there is no consistency in the questions you will be asked or the situations you will be in. In its most general sense the committee will review all of the candidate's packets given to the committee from HR. The packets are scored. Do yourself a favor by CLEARLY addressing in your cover letter how you meet each of the stated minimum and preferred qualifications. The clearer you are for the committee members the better. Ignore a page limit  this is academia not business.   The process then consists generally of a telephone/Skype interview followed by a campus visit for the last 23 candidates. Your offer will come after that if you are selected. There is not a lot of negotiation space for salary but there is some; take advantage of this opportunity to negotiate your salary. EWU does not give raises for merit so beyond COLA raises your salary is static.  Finally understand that EWU's HR department has no incentive to move quickly and they live up to that expectation. Add in the reality that it is a state bureaucracy that encourages mediocrity and you have a pretty good feel for the time frame you can expect.

Recruiter contacted through LinkedIn message. I liked that you can still work and do teaching on the side virtually at nights. I then scheduled call with recruiter from 2u who was hiring for instructor role. The timing was very slow and the soonest i could schedule a call for was over a month out on the calendly link. During the 40min recorded recruiter call it was friendly second half of call they asked basic questions about my background rating skill in python JavaScript SQL from 1 to 5 and I asked questions about the role. The first half of the call was just the recruiter talking about the role and how the schedule works.

First interview was over the phone with the recruiter. After that I was given a homework assignment to complete and submit.

Overall a very professional set up and an enjoyable interview process. I had a phone screening with the Senior Talent Acquisition Partner followed by a 30 minute phone interview with the Content Marketing Manager. For the next stage I was asked to write a short blog post (12 hours) and submit it in advance of 3 backtoback interviews with the Content Marketing Manager Product Marketing Manager and Sr. Product Marketing Manager. All three interviews went well and each person was knowledgeable and passionate about ed tech.

Had a first call with talent acquisition which went pretty well. He was very enthusiastic and gave a lot of good insight into the company. Moved forward with the second call which was ok.

After the last round didn't hear from them for about 2 weeks. I had to proactively follow up and was told that I was ""too much of a data scientist and not enough of a data analyst"".

I had an employee referral for the position and the recruiter reached out to me within a few days after. During the initial phone screen I was asked questions about my background with research as well as compensation range. I was pushed forward to a 30 minute phone screen with the hiring manager. I was able to ask more questions about the role itself and the team. After the phone screen I was referred to an onsite group interview. The onsite interviews were 4.5 hours long I started out the day with a 30 minute presentation. I think I met with about 8 team members over the course of the day.

The HR recruiter who initially reached out scheduled the interview. A second HR associate provided the schedule and requested a list of references.

I was familiar with the question but I stumbled on it and the interviewer's advice didn't help. The third one was a casual conversation with 2 HR representatives.

1 phone interview (30 minutes) and 1 onsite interview (2 hours) .  First phone interview is a deep dive into your resume and personal experience. Onsite interview involves talking about one personal project (45 min) and a technical screen (45 min). A lot of emphasis on personal projects and previous work experience.

Multiple interviews with team and in person interview with leadership team.

"The interview process consisted of 3 rounds:  1. Phone screen with recruiter. 2. Technical Phone Interview with engineer.  3. Onsite interview.   Overall the interview process was smooth sailing until the onsite which was a bit of a trainwreck...When I arrived I was welcomed and checkedin no problem however as the recruiter started leading me to the room I noticed that there was a lack of diversity in the office which is a red flag for me (ironic because the CEO/founder is a POC). If I remember correctly my interview overlapped with another and things got awkward from there because the engineers seemed hasty and kept looking at the time as they asked me questions. I felt they were unprepared (hadn't even seen my resume) and didn't care to get to know me on a personal level. In 3 different occasions I asked what they wanted from an intern and got the same generic response ""someone who is willing to learn collaborative etc"" only to learn this particular engineer had never worked with an intern before.  My least favorite part was the recruiter's demeanor at the end of the interview rounds they seemed uninterested on anything I had to say and even scowled at me as if I was wasting their time even though they asked for my feedback and I said positive things at the time. After that experience I was curious as to what might be going on and luckily I found out that they are having sustainability and direction issues within the company which might explain why they want cheap engineers for interns. When the recruiter called me to tell me I got rejected I received generic feedback ""you were a strong candidate but some were stronger"" and had no real feedback to offer me as if everything had been scripted. After that experience I was very relieved it didn't work out.",0.98317367,0.01653052,0.00029582044

It was pretty long. A recruiter reached out to me to schedule a call then I did two other phone interviews before getting invited to an onsite interview. There I had 5 or 6 30min interviews.

Completed a one hour phone screening then scheduled interviews via email. Prior to interviewing with the team I completed a skills assessment.

The whole interview process was very smooth and I had an amazing recruiter. I applied online and received an email from a recruiter with a request to answer a few questions about myself and my experiences. After this initial email I was contacted for a google hangout call with the recruiter and then another google hangout call with the hiring manager. After this was the inperson interview in which I met with several people on my team.  I cannot say enough great things about my recruiter. She was very attentive and so open throughout the whole process. You can tell that she really cares about the people she recruits and she makes a point to make them feel comfortable and prepared for the interviewing process. She is really a great example of what the company is like and is honestly the best recruiter I have worked with. After I started working at the company she even took me out for coffee to chat about how my first week was progressing.  EdX impresses me with how great their HR department is. Everyone is so friendly and focused on helping others succeed. I am so glad that I made the choice to join this company and my recruiter really added to the positive experience that I had with my interviews here.,0.0003671728,0.00064858043,0.9989843

I had two phone interviews one with HR and one with the hiring manager. HR was very quick to schedule interviews and did a great job following up with me in a timely manner. The total process took 3 weeks. I felt I had positive interviews with both HR and the hiring manager so I was a bit surprised when I was told they wouldn't be moving forward with the interview process. I felt I fit all of the qualities they listed in the posting so I asked for feedback on any areas where I could improve. HR gave me a vague response and said I was qualified but that other candidates better suited the business' current needs which is a paradoxical answer in my opinion. This answer left me wondering if it was a close call or if it was a problem with my personality since they said I was qualified but also said they didn't see a fit for this particular role.  I think it is rare to receive genuine feedback from HR (probably for liability reasons) but it would be helpful if HR provided more concrete feedback for candidates that are clearly qualified but are not selected to move forward for one reason or another.,0.047022454,0.9513267,0.0016507363

HR seems to have a lot of turnover as the worker who friend who interviewed before left soon after I got an interview. That was warning number one. The work has potential but they seem to hire by people's personality rather than ability to get work done (which reflects on the courses' management). That was warning number two. I had to meet with 5 members of the team which is fine but one had a personal dislike with me right away (and I don't even know her) so I am sure she is the reason I did not get the position.,0.9945918,0.005289939,0.000118197444
Phone screen with recruiter that went well then a second phone interview with another manager who was not the hiring manager (CTO) due to his scheduling difficulty.

I was referred by a current employee at edX. Soon after my referral a recruiter reached out to me and guided me through the process. I had two interviews over Google Hangouts before I went to the edX HQ in Cambridge MA to meet the team. I was shown around the office and provided the opportunity to interface with team members of various levels of seniority. Then I had one more Hangout interview.

Had an HR screening then 45 min tech screening. Tech screener basically went into further depth about the job and then asked me to talk about my past projects.

I knew someone in the organization so I had extra information going in. Overall I thought the process went well (maybe there's a halo effect since I took the job?) but it was pretty long  there was a gap between my phone interview and in person interview.

After a phone call with a recruiter I was invited for an in person interview. I met with two members of the recruiting staff two other partner managers and a hiring manager. Everyone was nice but since it was broken up there were a lot of repetitive questions. I was there for 3 hours and one of the recruiters asked when I could come back for an additional interview but then I never heard a word and got an automated rejection email 3 weeks later. I think after a face to face interview it is courteous to at least call the person or send a personalized email.

I was asked what I needed to know rather than them telling me what they needed me to know. For heavens sake I'm the new employee I don't know what I need to know.  If you learn from watching you're in luck. The training is just following people around prior to being thrown into the job without knowledge of what their full duties and where college resources are. I was told to reread my job description when I had questions.  Plan for an additional hour of Word and Excel testing for all levels even when your job does not require excellence in those skills.,0.9988462,0.0010006066,0.0001532396
The interview was conducted by three people from HR. They asked a lot of random questions about how I would handle certain situations and what I thought my best personality traits were. I thought these questions were somewhat relevant but they never really touched on my qualifications specific job duties or experience.  I had to take a timed Microsoft Word and Excel test plus a typing test. They said they would share the results with me but never did.   I was also told that I would hear back about the position in about two weeks. They were very vague so I didn't expect to hear back soon but after a month pasted I stopped by to ask about the position and they wouldn't give me the time of day. I was only told that I would get an email one way or the other; I did eventually get one of those mass rejection emails after about a month and a half.,0.9969478,0.0029225622,0.00012960903

"This position was within Elon Law School. From the date that the position stopped accepting applications to the date they gave me my final disposition took 3 months. It took a month to receive an invitation for an initial Skype interview. The interview was with their ""hiring committee"" and consisted of the standard interview questions. After the Skype interview was completed I was asked to come for a facetoface interview the following week. This interview took 4 hours and included talking with faculty staff and students. I was also asked to prepare and give a 30 minute presentation on some type of educational technology (very little instructions were provided for this part).   Everyone seemed very professional and experienced. The staff and faculty were friendly and seemed vested in the person who was going to be taking this position. I was given the opportunity at the end of the interview to ask questions about the job and details. The benefits seemed competitive with other similar institutions but answers to question of pay were confusing. When asked about the pay compensation the reply was ""Well we pay lower than most other higher education institutions. You are hourly so it will be low 20s."" It was not specified if this was low $20k/year or low $20/hour... I tend to think low $20k/year somewhere in the range of $12/hour.  After the facetoface interview my references were all contacted within 3 weeks. After my last reference was contacted I emailed the position contact (that I had been in contact with since the first interview) and reiterated my interest in the job and inquired whether they had an updated time table for the rest of the interview process. I received no reply after two weeks. So I emailed the contact again thanking them for being a possible candidate for their position and letting them know that anything additional they need from me I would provide. Another week and a half went by without a reply from the interview contact. I finally got an HR automated email saying that I was no longer being considered for the position.   Overall the process seemed entirely too drawn out for the position and requirements. The staff and faculty were very professional when I met them facetoface but I would have liked to get a reply to the multiple emails that I sent to the job contact (almost a month with no replies). I feel that the lack of reply displayed a fair amount of unprofessionalism for a person tasked with hiring and welcoming applicants and new hires into a position.",0.995255,0.0045521636,0.00019295448

"The job was posted online on the employer's website and on NACEWeb. About 1 month after applying I received a phone call for a quick 15 minute phone interview with one of the assistant deans at the school who was on the hiring committee. A short few days later an invitation to come down to the school for a daylong interview was received via email. Upon acceptance arrangements were made within a few days for an interview date. The interview was a full day from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. It started off with coffee with one of the hiring committee members  this was just an informal chat about how I got to be interested in career counseling and what the position entailed and what to expect for the rest of the day. This was followed by about 3 more 1on1 interviews with the dean the supervisor I would be working directly under and the supervisor's direct supervisor. The interviews all went extremely well except for the supervisor I would have been working for  considering that he was the director of career services he did a very poor job of interviewing me and I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt as he himself had only joined the school 3 weeks prior. However I also took his behavior as red flag. He hadn't read my resume and had to ask me 23 times what my name was in the interview. He asked me where I was working...which obviously is also on my resume. Then his cell phone rang and he answered it and proceeded to have a 3045 second conversation with his wife. Extremely poor etiquette for an apparent ""professional"" who does career development for a living! Then he kept bragging about what a great director he is and said all these catch phrases like ""i don't abdicate I advocate!"" After my interview with him I interviewed with his supervisor who was very nice but she ended up saying verbatim all the same catch phrases that described her supervising style...exact same wording! I don't know who's words were who's but my gut feeling is telling me that the director of career services copied them from her. So I left that interview feeling like my prospective direct supervisor was a fraud. These interviews were followed by a group lunch interview with other career services staff and a few professors...this was more easygoing and relaxed but still there were a lot of questions on what my ideas were for the career services office how outreach to students could be done better marketing ideas etc. After lunch was a campus tour led by one of their students. Then there was a short break to relax freshen up for a bit. Then a final interview with the chair of the hiring committee. Everything went extremely well and was very easy it was just unfortunate the the director of career services was such a poor representative for the school and was seemingly problematic in his behavior. But otherwise the folks at Elon are gracious and pleasant very easygoing. I would have felt extremely comfortable working their. There was such great hospitality displayed. The director of career services is not from North Carolina...he's from Ohio or somewhere...so he obviously didn't have the hospitable nature like the other southerners that worked there. Elon's campus is also gorgeous and an ideal work environment. It's just too bad that the director of career services doesn't fit the culture and work ethic of Elon. But for anyone looking for better quality of life keep an eye on this employer...and maybe look for something outside career services until this director leaves.",0.85557395,0.1434213,0.0010047238

I was asked questions about the position what I would be capable of bringing to the team and where I wished to go. I interviewed with a panel as well as the team which I was joining.

Phone interview then oncampus interview that lasted all day and included dinner the night before. The phone interview was fairly simple.

I had a very positive phone interview with the head of marketing and he let me know he’d like to bring me in for an in person interview. His assistant contacted me only via email to schedule the in person interview. I unfortunately had a mandatory business trip and an important meeting on the 2 days offered. Assistant wrote me back (never picked up phone) and told me I was no longer a candidate because I couldn’t make the two dates offered. Scheduling issues could have been resolved with a simple phone call. Clearly they don’t care that candidates must protect their current job and can’t drop everything with very short notice. It’s good to find out about negative company cultures before you get excited about a role. I’m grateful their true colors showed before I wasted my time.,0.778933,0.21329932,0.0077676536
Interview process was very standard beginning with phone screening coming in to interview with the team and then a final round where you meet with HR and the President. The longest point in the process was just trying to schedule something with the President as he was traveling. Like someone said previously however just because you have a final interview with the President does not mean that you have the job. Even though I was offered the job I know that the other candidate met with him as well.

I was emailed first then had an initial phone interview and later an in person interview was scheduled. The people were friendly and the interview questions were standard. Initially I was told I would be called back for a second interview but it was never scheduled.

Lengthy interview process. Step 1 was a phone conversation. Step 2 was an interview with a team of people. Step 3 was an interview with the head of the department. Step 4 was an interview with the President of the university. Following that interview I was brought down to HR to review benefits and sign off on a background check.  References were called just prior to Step 3.  Everyone was especially nice and a pleasure to deal with. The interviews itself were not difficult. I had to follow up to see if a decision had been made as I had not heard anything after almost a week following the meeting with the president. Meeting with HR immediately following the meeting with the president did lead me to believe I was likely to be offered the position as was the fact that my references were contacted so early in the process.,0.0026476698,0.969875,0.0274773
The interview process took four weeks. I had a phone interview then a panel interview with members of the department then an interview with the Vice President of the department and finally one with the President himself.

"First of all the total interview took almost 2 months. First phone interview with the HR everything goes fine she said she will call me within next 2 weeks. Two weeks later the IT department called and said he will call me the next week with some test for the job.  Next week comes by HR or IT department did not call me but emailed me saying ""There will be Skype interview with the IT department"" and for some reason the soonest that I could do would be the next 2 weeks.  It's roughly 4 weeks now. And because I am a good person and always understand people's condition I tried to give this a chance.  Now comes to the Skype interview. I met 2 of the IT department persons. They assigned me a test to design one of their web pages and they also mentioned about the job responsibility which I am applying for.  He said he will need me to design a website (with Adobe or any design tools) and give it to the other department to get it develop or code. However the test that they gave me requires me to design as well as develop within a short amount of time.   Again because I am a nice person and just want to get this over with (even though that's not what I am applying for and that is not listed in the job responsibility) I give it a go.  After I send the test. One week goes by no phone call or email from any of the department. I tried to give them heads up. Turns out they forgot to notify me that I passed the test.  2 weeks later they want me to come to their campus in Virginia to talk to another IT department for the final interview. I thought this is gonna be more of the design talk since that's the position that I was applied for. Plus I remember from the last interview with one of the IT department told me that all I do would be design the website possibly making a mockup and do some test on the website.   Oh god no they asked me about immigration questions and the technical questions that have nothing to do with web design. Every different aspect of code and development of the website even SEO question (search engine optimization) which I never even mention it in my resume. In the end I look like a donkey who had no idea even what they are asking. And the good part is I don't get the job",0.8500457,0.1490478,0.00090655097

Overall simply straight forward process. First I had a phone interview then another one with VP in person. Questions asked were a little bit unprofessional.  The interview began with traditional interview questions and some behavioral questions but shifted to a kind of weird questions in the end.

The HR representative offered me a 30minute in person interview with the search committee.  As I did not live in NYC (I'm from PA) I requested if I could have a phone or Skype interview.  The HR rep told me that they would consult with the search committee.  The next day I was informed that the committee was only conducting inperson interviews.  I then inquired about travel reimbursements to which HR stated that anything within a 120 mile radius of the campus is considered local so there is no reimbursement.  I declined the interview because it was not worth the time or money to travel to NYC at my expense for a 30 minute interview.  In this field this is highly unusual and most firstround interviews are on the phone/Skype and overall I felt that it was a testament to the institution's lack of desire to attract good candidates who are not from th NYC area.,0.9983658,0.0014718964,0.0001622812

"The entire Mathematics Interview process is Very Very slow compared to other Universities and/or HBCU that I previously interviewed with.  The Interview Process was broken down into the following parts: Credential screening and ranking of potential candidates; The TopCandidates (~915 people) are offered a Recorded Phone Interview with the math department search/screen committee members;  The TopCandidates (~612 people) are invited to FAMU campus to give a research talk and teaching talk and to ""mingle"" with the current faculty/staff;  At this point allegedly the TopCandidates names are forwarded to the Dean's office and you will have two phone interviews.  One phone interview will deal with your track record and other general questions.  The second phone interview will be focus around your salary expectations.  However beware the Dean and associates will use all spare nothing for the sake of low balling you.  Be firm with your minimum salary expections others you will be poorly compensated as long as you work at FAMU.  The admin only give themselves market value raises and/or bonus.  Everyone else typically gets nothing.",0.99866426,0.0012010898,0.0001346094

"The individual that scheduled the first interview left a couple msg on a Monday that I had been selected for interview. The final message that day was that the interview would be the next day Tuesday and that she ""expected"" to hear back from me by 4pm that day (msg left at 3:15 with no indication of time only that it would be in Admin bldg). I currently am employed and live 5 hours away.  Next day I do not hear back so I call HR. HR states that typically for that level of position they allow candidate to arrange for travel a few days out (incl reimbursement for out of town travel). HR rep contacts hiring manager and reports back that the person who previously left messages would contact me to schedule interview next week to allow for travel. This occurred but she didn't  seem to know what she was doing (could not even tell me whom I'd be meeting with).

I was contacted again woman left a msg with details for 2nd interview I called back and left a msg accepting time/date and I asked about process and whom I'd be interviewing with. She sent email confirming meeting but did not answer one question about accommodations or type of interview. 2nd: It wa VP of program area and other leadership rep.  There was no real structure no real questions... it was as if they already knew what I found out 2 weeks later when I called to follow up with VP. They pulled the position and rewrote it I'd have to reapply but she encouraged me to reapply and would be sure to reimburse travel for revised position (could not for previous pos). No thank you.

Was interviewed by a panel of 6 people.  Not sure why this was necessary as this was a back office noninstructional type position.  Speaking before a group would not be a regular part of this position. I sat at the end of the table and each person took a turn and asked a question.  One interviewer actually asked a 3 PART question!!  I thought this inconsiderate to the applicant. Job interviews are nerve wracking as it is but to be asked a 3 part question like it's a Miss America pageant?  It's too much.   Not even sure if I answered all the parts.   I walked away from this interview feeling like they judged me on presentation/interview skills rather than on my other more pertinent credentials/experience/training.

I want to start off by saying that the people that were leading the interview process were very nice but their technique was extremely flawed. It was a group interview but I did not anticipate to walk into a room with over 20 candidates. We each got 30 seconds to introduce ourselves which is impractical. They also made us spend 5 min with a partner and then we had 30 seconds to tell them why they should hire our partner for the position. They didn’t really allow us anytime for them to get to know us. I doubt with the combined 1 minute of information they learned about us they were even able to keep track with 20 other girls in the room. Towards the end of this process we find out that they were only filling one position. So it made no sense to have that many women in a room for one position. They definitely should’ve narrowed it down drastically before wasting everyone’s time. I say everyone because they reposted the job application a few hours after our interview on indeed. Very inconsiderate.,0.99679416,0.0029865373,0.00021937636

"At first my experience seemed promising; I was contacted via Indeed email by an individual representing the college. She/he emailed after looking at my resume and was very interested to meet. We briefly emailed back and forth and settled on later that week. Once the day came I arrived at the school and waited to meet w/ a panel of individuals. The interview went VERY well which was followed by a campus tour. At the conclusion of the interview & tour (roughly 1.5 hours) I was told they had a few more interviews and I would hear from them in a week.  A week later I received a call from one of the people that was in the interview...one of the employees who wasn't there in the panel interview wanted to meet with me. We met later that week! The interview went so well I thought I'd be offered the position on the spot. I was escorted back to the main office where I had my background check done and they gave me directions for where to go to do my drug test. SUCCESS....or so I thought!   Before leaving again I'm told it would be a week so I waited. After a week I emailed to followup and make sure they had everything they needed as I also had to do an online assessment. With my application file complete I wait and wait to hear about their decision. NO response. So I call and leave a voice message again no response.  I email my contact who I had been talking with through this whole process and basically say since they had not contacted me I assumed they went with other candidates and wished them well...only to receive a response she/he was soo swamped and they had still not made a decision but they would by the end of week.   I'm sure I don't have to tell you I still  haven't heard from them. Such a waste of my time and their money. So unprofessional on so many levels.

"I submitted my resume to Fortis and almost immediately received a phone call from the Regional Director of Admissions who happened to be visiting the local college.  The job posting said ""Bachelor degree preferred."" I let him know that I did not have a degree and he let me know that my experience trumped a degree and scheduled me for a F2F the next morning.  I arrived to my appointment five minutes early but the office I was to go to was locked. After waiting by the door for a few minutes an instructor showed up and was able to let me in the office. The receptionist finally came out from a back office and asked me what I was there for. After telling her I was there to interview the Campus President came out and again confirmed why I was there and then disappeared into the back office. Finally about 10 minutes after my scheduled interview the CP came back out and told me that the person I was to interview with wouldn't be there that morning but he would meet with me. He told me as well that experience trumped education however throughout our conversation he kept insulting me by mentioning the fact that I was ""uneducated."" After we spoke for roughly 15 minutes he ended the interview and said that he had a meeting to go to but that the Director of Admissions would be calling me to schedule another appointment. After not hearing from the DOA I emailed the CP to inquire about the status of my next interview. He replied that the DOA had another ""route"" in mind and that I would not be scheduled for another interview. The entire time I was at my original appointment and after receiving the email from the CP I feel like they never had any intention of seriously considering me for the position and that my trip to their location was a complete waste of my time and gas.

I had to give a presentation to everyone I met with that day a room of about 30 people. I also toured the facilities in the departments I'd be recruiting students for and had individual meetings with faculty. The great thing was that the person who had the job last took me on the tour and was available for me to ask questions.

Hiring was fairly easy. You are hired online it didn't take much to get an interview. After the interview you're practically a shoein.

There really wasn't an interview process. I practically already have a relationship with a professor to work in a lab.

I interviewed about a year ago.  Unless their interview process has changed.  The process is way to long for a job that pays less than $35000 a year. The process took almost four hours.    During that span I interviewed with the assistant director of the advisement center a professor  a group of three advisor an entire room of advisors and the director.    They all essentially asked the same questions.  I've interviewed for another advisor position and the interview was a little less than an hour.  That is all it takes.  So if Georgia College hasn't changed their way of interviewing they need to change it ASAP.,0.998417,0.0014282322,0.00015476884

The initial interview process was a short 30 minute phone conversation.  It felt like it was scripted and didn't actual offer any opportunity to really get to know the applicant or their skills.  There were bullet points on my resume that related directly to this position but nothing about my related work experience was asked.,0.9978777,0.001984773,0.00013756915
Very simple interview to go through probably my easiest ever. Essentially was a normal conversation with my potential supervisor mainly talking about what was necessary for the job. She was mainly vetting me to see if I was personable and friendly. The type of person that would work good with the students that would come into the office. Now this interview may not be indicative of other interviews within the University as this was a student position but I have had other interviews in the school that have been of a similar format.,0.000940452,0.99631196,0.0027476659
I was emailed to set up an interview. The interview started with two of the current student workers. They asked me simple question about myself. They then directed me to meet with the directors.

I applied online. First round of interviews was over the phone with three employees from the same department and lasted about 30 minutes. Very scripted and basic questions. Within about 3 weeks I was called back for an in person interview which took most of the day. About 45 minutes was dedicated to more in depth questions from the same three employees from the phone interview. I had to prepare and present to the employees as if I was already hired and working in the role at a campus fair. Finally an hour was devoted to a one on one interview with the head of the department. From there it was another 3 weeks for the job offer.,0.99638015,0.0034565383,0.0001633467

I applied to the masters of biology program and my SAT scores and other science grades led me to be offered a graduate assistantship and free tuition. I was hesitant at first because I was actually a non science major in my undergrad and I knew i was going to be taking 6000 level classes and teaching for the very first time. I was reassured that I could handle the work. I did my own personal studying as well as prep work in our shared Graduate assistant office.,0.0011103973,0.98630095,0.012588684

They are very easy going and easy to talk to. GGC values their diversity so they are very open to people from all different backgrounds.  Throughout the interview they were making sure that I was very comfortable and they also let me ask them questions that I had. They also reply fast to their emails if I were to have any important question and the process was very quick. Amazing individuals!,0.00035046035,0.00060923543,0.9990403
The process was not managed well at all. It's said that as a young campus they are still trying to solidify their processes and culture but to me it seems that there is just plain incompetency and/or no concern for candidates on their part. A brief prescreen with the hiring manager. This was followed by an online video interview with some of the hiring committee. Was invited for an oncampus interview with the full committee. Was very positive about the interviews especially as the hiring manager said offhand during the online interview that they should bring me to campus. However they didn't pay for any of the campus trip from out of town. Further despite being told that the oncampus interview was scheduled for when the entire committee could be present only a portion of the committee (the same people from the online portion) were present. To add insult to injury no new questions were asked of me  the exact same questions were repeated by the same exact people. I have to say a very high lack of professionalism during the whole process made worse by the fact that I had to foot the bill for the campus visit. It took a month and a half after the 2nd interview to hear anything.,0.9979511,0.0018630084,0.00018595593

I applied online and received an invitation for an interview via email. They scheduled the interview for about 3 weeks after I received the email which was a ridiculously long wait. It was the worst interview I have ever been to. They asked questions that had nothing to do with the job I was applying for. They seemed to be management based even though I was not applying to be in charge of anybody. They also couldn’t answer any questions about pay or benefits. They said it could take another 13 months to hear anything from HR if they wanted to hire me. I was not happy with the idea of waiting that long for a job where I didn’t even know if it would pay me what I needed.,0.99905103,0.00078232615,0.00016660626
The interview was very straight forward. The boss and the supervisor will ask you a few questions about computer hardware and software. the next part will be a lot of tech question that requires a thinking process.,0.0010485689,0.99697006,0.0019813005

3 separate interviews: 1.) Phone with hiring manager (30 min) 2.) In person with hiring manager and another member of staff (1 hr) 3.) In person with the entire staff (2 hrs)  I felt fairly confident during the process and was surprised when I never hear back from HR or the hiring manager. The culture of the college is clearly not solidified yet and I think there's a lot of disorganization with processes like hiring.,0.9977048,0.0021553063,0.00013984543

Fairly simple  if you are honestly interested in teaching/tutoring people then you can have a quick and truthful discussion with the professors you'll be working with/under. It's more of a sitdownandhaveadiscussion rather than straight questions and answers. There is no right or wrong answer they just want to see if you are competent and creative enough to help your fellow students with biology.,0.0054447986,0.9942281,0.00032709283
Received a call from HR and was asked if I had a few minutes for a couple of screening questions.  These were not screening questions.  These were actual interview questions.  I was completely caught off guard but apparently did alright.  I was called for an actual interview. Since I was out of town the next interview was by Skype. It was a panel type interview and everyone was so nice.  It was very enjoyable for an interview.  I was advised that it would be several weeks before hearing the outcome.  However I never received any notification.  That was disappointing.  Even a letter advising you are not selected is better than hearing nothing at all.,0.018803176,0.95775115,0.02344573

On the one hand the interview process was relatively swift and effortless and certain people with whom I interacted appeared to be pleasant and affirming.  The campus also is compact relatively nice and accessible.  Conversely the interview schedule was disjointed (I am used to having all committee members in one room as opposed to meeting with them separately) and lunch consisted of a formal interview in a public dining room instead of a relaxed conversation that would have allowed me to eat the food in front of me.  Moreover my presentation entailed providing short responses to questions that I had been asked during previous sessions.    Finally I had the misfortune of interacting with the person to whom I would have reported via a video call.  She had just been hired but was slated to start later in the year and had reportedly posted a link to the job for which I was interviewing on her LinkedIn page the day before my campus visit.  Despite the senior role that she would occupy at Goucher College this person was quite condescending and obnoxious (microaggression personified?); she denigrated my references wanted to know why a former supervisor had not been listed (I deliberately chose individuals with whom I had worked at liberal arts colleges as the only supervisor relevant to the role had retired) and blithely dismissed my candidacy because I did not belong to a professional association of which she apparently is an active member.  Her tone was insulting and accusatory and when she was done the bossinwaiting abruptly ended the call.  My time at Goucher was bewildering to say the least and the lack of clarity regarding simple questions that I posed the bizarre interview schedule my interesting interaction with the bossinwaiting lack of intentional staff diversity and issues regarding the institution’s fiscal health were warning signs that I could not ignore.,0.9934437,0.0061892592,0.00036705344

I enjoyed the interview process the interview panel was friendly. They wanted to learn about you and why you would be a good fit for the college. The college is quite culturally diverse.

There were two interviews; the first interview had a panel with about 4 members and the second interview was with the Director and President of the division. During the first interview I received a phone call about a month after applying and was asked to come in for an interview. At that interview it was held in a small conference room and I sat across from the panel. They handed me a paper with a list of questions and said I could review the questions before getting started and then they just went down the line of questions; each alternating in asking me the questions.   The second interview was pretty laid back and was just a casual interview with the Director and President of the department and they asked me where I see myself in 5 years why I wanted to work for that department etc.,0.0048644193,0.9949044,0.00023118123
I taught a short mock information literacy session and answered lots of standard questions about my experience working with students and faculty as well as how I work with diverse populations. They were one of the few places I've interviewed with who gave me a copy of the questions which is such a nice thing to do. It was actually a pretty good experience as far as interviews go. All of the interviewers seemed very pleasant and I thought I presented myself reasonably well. I left the interview feeling very positive.  However after all of that rushed preparation and stress (the turnaround between being offered an interview and doing it was less than a week) as well as a lot of travel to get there I was never contacted about their decision even after checking in a month later by email. It was random chance that I happen to be friends with one of the two individuals who did get the position so I know how things turned out. To me that lack of even a brief form email letting me know I wasn't hired seems exceptionally rude and disrespectful of my time. I hope that whatever happened there was an error of some kind and not their usual policy.,0.083024226,0.8048799,0.11209591
I attended a scheduled meeting with the person who would be my supervisor during employment. My employee referral acted as a liason and this greatly increased the casual feeling of the introductions.

"I interviewed for a staff position at a cultural organization on campus. I had a phone interview which I would say was more extensive than most I've had and then a day of inperson interviews at the office in which I'd be working. Overall it was a good experienceinterviewers were friendly and gracious they made sure to show me around the facilities/campus and I got to meet my potential coworkers all of which helped me assess my level of interest in the position. They were also helpful and communicative when I was making travel plans (I was traveling in from another state).  I've never received a rejection from either the hiring manager or the human resources office. Considering the time I spent traveling to the interview and back this is really disrespectful and has certainly tanked my impression of the organization. I realize ""ghosting"" on candidates has become common but there's really no excuse for not getting in touch with a candidate to let them know the outcome of the search and thank them for their time.",0.026603287,0.18377951,0.7896172

"The interview was a Zoom based interview for a remote position that occurred in two stages. The first stage was with supervisors and the hiring manager then progressed to a panel of individuals who were selected to represent different parts of the organization.  The organization is excessively reinforcing an artificial corporate culture of diversity. It's only good if it's authentic.  During the first part of the interview we went over the usual interview questions for the position explaining why I would be a good fit etc. Toward the end after the manager explained what diversity meant to them ""no one should be judged based on how they look"". later asked ""Why aren't you wearing a tie? "" To which I explained that this is a remote position I was dressed appropriately in a nice solid color buttonup shirt and that the industry has moved to a more casual position on dress. To me this indicates that the employer cares less about the qualifications and more about control over the individual and how they look.  During the first and second part of the interview as well as the application I was told to explain my view on diversity in the workplace 4 times. Diversity is important but it shouldn't be something someone needs to actively pursue to be authentic about it it should come naturally. This indicates to me that the culture of the workplace is struggling with diversity. The interviewers also brought my age into consideration stating that I was pretty young and new to the field (5 years of industry experience) for this mid level position. Experience and qualifications should be the only thing discussed in an interview not age. Pay range was also below the industry normal. The interviewers had been with the company for decades I don't believe they have had to hire a new addition to their team in a long time.  Overall the staff on the board seemed friendly but there were too many red flags for me to consider this position if I were to get an offer. I have not heard from the organization and the interview was a month ago.",0.99266124,0.0071045747,0.00023415525

It takes forever to hear from them (months) once you submit an application to their website. When they do call for the interview the people are very friendly and helpful. The interview process is a total headscratcher though. Basically it's anywhere from 37 people who each take turns asking scripted questions. No followup questions they just move onto the next questions. The questions are strange as well. They seem to be very cerebral and would give the interviewers absolutely no idea of what the person being interviewed is actually like. It is odd to give answers and have no one comment on the answers or ask a followup question. I've had 3 interviews with them and it's been the same way each time. I've also felt like it was a waste of time because twice they decided to pull the position and not hire anyone due to lack of funding or something.

I was not really 100% what they were looking for in that position but my background and education matched with another position they had open and asked me if I was interested in teaching a different class.  They sent me the syllabus for the class to review I let them know that I was interested and I started teaching the following quarter.,0.0004880489,0.99908733,0.00042457262

Interview process involved a short phone screening followed by a facetoface interview with seven people. Most were in person but there were two participating via phone. The individuals included the incumbent job holder a direct report and leaders form other areas with which the position interacted. Oddly the hiring manager did not participate in the interview. I was asked a very wide range of questions depending on the perspective of the person asking the question. Most of the focus was on my current job and some of the changes that I had implemented in that position. This past experience was very relevant to the job I was interviewing for. The interview wasn't to terribly challenging because I just had to talk a lot about my past work and describe some of the details on how I did what I did and what drove my decision making. The position I was interviewing for also involved people management responsibilities so I was also asked questions about my people management style and practices. They were clearly concerned with getting someone who would manage people in a manner consistent with the organization's values.  After the facetoface interview there was about a month where things didn't move forward. Harrison expressed interest in moving forward but it didn't happen quickly. Eventually I had a phone interview with the hiring manager and a second phone interview with his manager. The second interview was conducted on a Saturday morning to fit it into the Provost's schedule. The hiring manager called me immediately after that interview and made an offer via phone.,0.028283266,0.97148895,0.00022779849

Hiring manageer emailed me a VERY brief email telling me a time and date to be there to interview 3 months after I submitted an application.

The process takes forever.  You have individual group and more individual interviews.  All sorts of weird hypothetical questions are asked.

First I had a phone interview. Then they asked me to do a follow up in person interview. This was a total of 3 hours. I personally think it’s a waste of time to have all potential interviewers do such an extensive interview process. First with the director then the coordinator and 2 more interviews with other people in the department and then an interview with HR. This took so much time and they don’t even follow up with you afterwards to let you know you didn’t get the job. Nor did they give you the chance and call your references. I just think there’s a different way to handle the interview process. The interview shouldn’t be longer than 45 mins.,0.9988217,0.0010165221,0.00016181024

You are helping a customer the phone rings an angry customer comes in demanding help. Run through how you would handle this situation.""

I initially responded to a job posting online. It was one of those generic electronic applications where you answer questions for what seems like forever. Upon clicking the submit button it took 12 weeks to hear back from anyone. When I finally did get a response I had a 3045 minute phone interview scheduled an inperson interview for the next week and 1 day before I was to show up was told by my interviewer (hereinafter cold shoulder) I needed to prepare a 30minute presentation for a group interview that best reflected my teaching abilities. I completely winged it.  Two weeks went by and I heard nothing. I called a couple of times always getting the runaround from cold shoulder; she acted like she didn't even remember me. Finally less than a week before the start of a new quarter cold shoulder offered me the job and stipulated that I had to create a syllabus and lesson plans from scratch for two courses that were never listed on the job announcement or discussed as possible job assignments during the interview or presentation phase. Again I winged it.  I was also told I'd get paid $2000 per course but later discovered that with all the administrative expectations involved to meet compliance what should have been $2225 an hour quickly dissipated to $78 an hour if you were to ever do the job the way Heald demanded. Again I winged it.  There were plenty of warning signs that I shouldn't have accepted this job. There were also plenty of warning signs that I shouldn't have kept this job either. Suffice to say I had no reservations about leaving.,0.99769753,0.0021423483,0.00016006506

It was a series of three interviews. After that I met with the campus president. It was more laid back than the prior interviews. I had asked for more money than the position paid. I focused on my experience and ability to teach and write curriculum. Then I stated that because I took a pay cut to work there and based on my experience as a Judge it would add prestige to the school and more credibility to the new legal program.

This was tedious and took over an hour to complete.  We were then divided based on decision to move forward and offered a time to come back for an actual interview/teachback.  This was scheduled almost a week later (actually less I believe).  The teachback and interview was a very smooth process and they communicated very clearly.  The interview was a group interview however it was like a circuit where we individually were asked questions by different staff members.  Most of us received a phone call in a few days on the decision.  Overall the interview process was painless and actually fun.

I never got a call back I made numerous phone calls to the director and left voice mails expressing my interest yet in the position and when I never heard back I emailed her. Never got a response the least they could of done was said thanks but no thanks. Needless to say I also asked my references if they were ever called and they were not. I would not want to be a student at this college the way they gave  me the silent treatment they would probably do the same to the students. So if anyone is thinking about applying for a position at this place I would not do it! I lived in Dayton and had to travel 3 times to the Columbus campus and they knew that.

"The interview was very informal and more conversational. She asked me about my background why I wanted this role why I had a gap on my resume etc. She opened with ""we can't pay you you're requested salary are you willing to negotiate?"". Then she went over the role. First red flag: The role was marketed as full time remote but it was clear that they wanted someone in person. She asked me if I had worked remotely before and basically said this would be the first time they opened up positions to be fully remote. She tells me however there was recently a meeting with their execs and they discussed whether they could even have remote staff. However she wanted to move forward with me for the second panel interview. So she lied to me twice and basically called to waste my time. She knew that the position wouldn't be remote and that I obviously wouldn't be contacted for a second interview. All of this after she boasted transparency. Second red flag: After I stated that I wanted to work for a company where I could grow professional she kept probing and asking what I meant by ""growth"". That to me meant there were no growth opportunities. Especially after she said their financial aid advisors ""do it all"". So you expect me to do it all for the bare min salary? That's the third red flag. I am not sure what she wished to gain from our meeting but it was clear to me that I would never hear from her again even after she assured me that I'd hear back within 3 days. So as a warning to future interviewers: clarify salary and remote work options PRIOR to the interview.",0.9969388,0.0029310433,0.00013014082

Phone interview with direct supervisor inperson interview with direct supervisor and one higher up and then an offer.  Took about two weeks in total.  I really liked the staff but turned down the offer because  1) they were very numbers focused without being willing to tell me what goals I would have to be able to know if I'm doing my job well and 2) the school used to be forprofit and I read a lot of student and staff reviews that alluded that the school hadn't really changed its ways.  This was confirmed by the interviewer saying that they give financial aid where other schools wouldn't.  They spun it as a positive thing but based on prior knowledge of the school it sounds like a way to get students further into debt.,0.9933202,0.0065268488,0.00015301161

The first interview is casual and the supervisor describes the position versus asking about your qualifications and expertise. The job is described as a position for an outgoing individual who enjoys meeting and communication with people.

The phone interview was only 30 minutes.  The on campus was one hour.  I arrived for the campus interview about 10 minutes early and awkwardly had to observe the interviewer conversing with the another candidate whom he had just finished interviewing and was walking out.

"Applied online. Received an email in a week for a phone interview. Phone interview with the director lasted about 45 minutes. Questions were mostly about my higher education background and experience and how I could relate that to working at Herzing. I had graduated with a four year degree from a traditional university. The director told me that the student demographic at Herzing was not like my experience and therefore I wouldn't be able to relate to struggling single parents and povertystricken students because ""I never struggled and had parents that loved me"". I was so shocked at the assumption I barely defended myself. Was told I would be contacted regardless if I got the position or not within a week.

I reached out to the VP of Marketing through LinkedIn and from there arranged an inperson meeting.  Throughout my 12 years of interviewing for marketingspecific roles never have I been so turned off by an individual or an organization during an interview process. On several occasions when describing myself and explaining my background I was met with rude mannerisms and overall impolite and unconstructive feedback.  Everyone has different interview styles and shouldn't be controlled or manipulated  it defeats the purpose of genuinely getting to know the person that might work for you.  The lack of unprofessionalism alone was a clear indicator it wasn't a fit for me.   As for the role itself it's focused on a sliver or component of marketing. Certainly more of a tactical entrylevel position with very little strategy involved.,0.9979323,0.0019111262,0.00015659678

I went to IUP for a campus interview for an assistant professor position in my field.  The backwater town and lowintensity of the school reflects in the faculty and students alike.  For example the questions faculty asked at my job talk didn't reflect more than an undergraduate understanding of our field and I had several meetings scheduled that faculty just didn't show up for.  The meetings I did have left a bad impression  for instance one program director had drooping eyes and was struggling to keep her head up  seemed like she was on pain medication.  When we went out for dinner after my talk I was given the check to pay for my own glass of wine!  What's more I was asked to purchase my own airfare and assured a reimbursement ...

It was great! The manager was very knowledgeable about ESL programs and very amicable.  There was an introduction completion of paperwork and a tour. Lots of question about curriculum teaching style knowledge of TESOL adult learning theories and presentations.,0.0030278866,0.043748528,0.9532236
The interview involved teaching a mock class followed by some pretty extensive information about the school. Also: it's worth noting that the application has to be filled out by hand and again online followed by a quick personality/work skills test.,0.00856488,0.9909815,0.0004536051
Their was a panel (managers) they had a chance to ask questions about history and typical interview questions. They gave me 15 minutes to prepare a lesson about grammar I gave the lesson they looked at each other and I was hired on the spot.,0.0063753147,0.99265224,0.0009724286
I contacted the campus to see if they were hiring. I was called back by the DoE and we set up an interview. I was hired immediately upon the interview. The interview was somewhat perfunctory and quite conversational as I had the needed qualifications and a space needed to be filled. My availability seemed to be the most important point. My experience and qualifications were not closely questioned except to discuss them in a general sense.,0.0007056773,0.9981839,0.0011104521
They're desperate for instructors so almost anyone has a chance of getting hired as long as you have a bachelor degree in any field. They ask you to do a mock lesson so they can judge what levels and courses you are qualified to teach. They give you very little time to prepare and how they judge you is very subjective. I've seen many instructors teaching grammar for example and they have no idea what they're even talking about.,0.9987264,0.0011230712,0.00015046127
I was asked how I would explain the difference between present perfect and simple past verb tenses. This was a realistic question since it's something ESL teachers need to know. The director was patient though I was late (couldn't find the building; it's set back from road). The interviewer was relaxed so the interview wasn't stressful.,0.00095949706,0.9873935,0.011646899
Very informal seemed as though they were in dire need.  Compensation was discussed and the need for an unofficial transcript as well as a bit of history about the school and the kinds of students that are there as well as the kinds that would likely make up my class.,0.0017304105,0.99812335,0.00014627272
Applied online and was called for a phone screen. Appeared on site for an inperson interview which was successfully completed. The next step was observing a class of an experienced faculty member. The interviewer got back to me a few days later to offer me the job. The whole process took less than 2 weeks.,0.0020945165,0.18231075,0.81559473
"I got called in for an interview. My contact went home and no one bothered to tell me. When I got to the school I had to fill out a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy of a job application and while still working on it I was it was time for the interview leave the application at the front desk.  I was next greeted by a ESL ""Manager"" who brought me upstairs to a cold (about 65℉) classroom handed me a pae from a teacher's manual and old me to teach a lesson.  So after a few minutes I taught the lesson to her and another ""Manager"" who couldn't have made it more obvious that this was a formality to cover their behinds while they bid their time and could hire a friend. The one played on his cell phone and they both asked sarcastic questions pretending to be students. They were NOT serious at all about finding an instructor.  I was grilled about their ""everyone needs to pass at all costs"" (lack of) philosophy of education and not shown their facilities or told specifics about their program.",0.9976139,0.002246719,0.00013938136
It was appropriately challenging while providing a insight into the inner workings of the company. i went through a number of interviews with multiple staff members. It made me really feel like they cared about the quality of employee they were about to hire.,0.2846097,0.7144975,0.0008927616
"The correct building is a little difficult to find since they have two buildings and neither is labeled as the ""main"" building. Once someone comes to show you into a classroom they give you a grammar book and tell you that you have about 5 minutes to prepare and then  explain a grammar point to the interviewers. From what I've heard it's always past simple vs present perfect.",0.45537335,0.5440684,0.0005582429
A friend told me she had been to classes there as an ESL student so I looked it up online. I contacted the ESL Department Chair and requested an interview. I was subsequently invited for one. The interview always involves a demo lesson and some boilerplate questions. I was hired and offered the position subsequently. There's not a lot of negotiation at this company. You either take the terms you're offered or they'll hire the next person on the list.,0.99837327,0.0014925387,0.00013414594

Met with Director after sending my resume. I am a graduate of ICT but I had to go through the process with other candidates. She tested my skills asked questions about me and where I saw myself with in the company and she was very specific about what she was looking for in that position. Needless to say I got the job.,0.0075629284,0.99219745,0.00023962144
There is a very detailed application that was 30 pages by the time I finished answering all the questions on it. The interview was a 12 conversation which was the easy part  the application was the lengthy and more difficult portion.,0.011056551,0.9882261,0.00071728794
I reached out to the regional director for an opportunity. The application was long and covered most of the interview. The interview was about 90 minute long with 5 people.,0.9987643,0.0011024895,0.0001332254
"I had a recruiter on Indeed reach out to me because her client Intervarsity was interested in setting up a phone interview. I was hesitant at first but after a few emails I decided to give it a chance.   Overall the phone interview was a little bit uncomfortable and odd. The manager stated that this role would be responsible for fundraising for part of their own salary. This would include asking for donations from family friends and different organizations.   The manager then asked ""are you religious or of Christian faith?"" After I told him that I didn't necessarily follow a specific religion he stated that ""unfortunately if you were to be put up against candidates who were of Christian faith they would have the upper hand.""   I understand that Intervarsity's mission is to promote the Christian faith but to make someone feel inferior because of their religion is unacceptable. If I knew that this organization was this strict about religion I wouldn't have gone through with the phone interview.",0.9617914,0.03801449,0.00019412549
Inconsistant in their process and were unable to provide a clear idea of what they were looking for in their staff. Requiring staff to fundraise their salary makes it exclusive and unequitable.,0.9990582,0.000769308,0.00017243136
Not professional; the interviewer was not paying attention to me and also did not know enough about the role and what was needed. Made a comment on my age and the 'life I have left to live'.,0.9987814,0.0010648781,0.00015369564
More like a conversation than an interview. They asked questions regarding your faith journey skills for the job at hand and scenario questions. Overall not as difficult or nerve wrecking as other job interviews.,0.03724081,0.9125253,0.050233904
The interview process was very laid back. I already had a relationship with the hiring manager so it was more about ways that I could grow in my this new position.,0.0013660316,0.99829465,0.00033933323
Fill out a long and detailed application.  Application is almost as if it is an interview but on paper.  An area director along with a regional director will meet with you to discuss your answers and may ask additional questions.,0.9977291,0.0021450708,0.00012586641
The job interview was formal but also relational. They really do try to get to know you beyond more than your qualifications. They ask about your life journey and significant experiences. They also ask situational questions regarding what you will do and how you arrive at that conclusion. I would say it's pretty straight forward of a process.,0.0041627716,0.9952068,0.0006304264
The application process is extensive and is very helpful in evaluating for yourself if this is a job you would enjoy and be qualified for. The interview process following the application is short and the phone call interviews are not extremely formal. The interviewer made it a helpful time for me to learn more about the organization and position while also interviewing me for my fit in the role.,0.0005510295,0.00244378,0.99700516
I had a phone interview and in person interview where the same questions were asked. Definitely could have been condensed and then a potential on campus interview. Only met with one person initially seemed like the whole department would be there.,0.039711326,0.9600894,0.00019926055

Attended campus interview. The interview went ok but the offer letter that was received was horrible and did not reflect what was previously discussed. For example there was a discrepancy regarding starting salary relocation expenses and opportunities for growth/development.,0.9970759,0.0027890478,0.00013499404
The process began with a phone interview in order to get to know candidates. From the phone interview that was conducted a month ago the director of this office gave me very little comfort that I would be seriously considered. Despite what the job description lists she indicated that she’s looking for a candidate with several years of experience. The new hire is someone she hopes can take over her responsibilities with little to no supervision. The director also mentioned that she does not want to train the new hire. To me this describes more of an Associate Director which I am capable of doing. However the description of the role is very entry level. The director also challenged my education insisting that anything earned through online effort does not compare to handson experience. I didn’t expect to proceed further after the phone interview but I received an invite for a facetoface based on my eagerness to join Iona. Once again the director challenged my education and made the determination then and there that I was not going to be her best choice for the role. I was bummed thinking how I could have convinced her better. But I realized the red flags about this director later. Coupled with the negative views on the DSHE program she’s dishonest with what she seeks in a candidate and stubborn about her views. Knowing that I was not her best choice from the phone interview it’s also inconsiderate of her to invite me in for a facetoface which took me away from my day job.,0.99795216,0.0018792433,0.00016858029

This process took about two months; was a very easy process. I went through an initial phone interview a 30 minute Zoom interview a marketing project showcasing your writing abilities and then an inperson interview on campus. The people were very nice and took me on a golf cart tour around campus. The process was very smooth but I declined due to the salary being insufficient for me (around $40k).,0.0029601692,0.9849858,0.012053994
I applied through their website directly. I had a phone interview with the hiring manager and was asked to create a mock email for alumni asking for university donations. After this (about 4 days later) they asked that I create some design examples for their Dolphin Dash initiative. After another 34 days they requested an in person interview. Talk of compensation wasn't discussed at this point. The oncampus interview was from 9:30 AM11:30 AM (I had to take personal PTO for this). I met with the marketing team who interviewed me (3 individuals) and then met with the advancement team (another 3 people). They were very friendly  both of those interviews lasted about 25 minutes. After this the hiring manager and the director took me on a golf cart tour of the university. This felt very strange as I had not been given an offer or even discussed compensation yet. They sat down with me at their boathouse area and felt like they were trying to smooze me into wanting to accept a low offer. When the director found out I had a daughter she kept saying things about the 'work flexibility' to be off on fridays during the summer and a winter break. That all is great but not for crappy pay. I never heard back from them. A tip for future interviews follow up with your interviewees. Don't tell them 'we love you and want to negotiate pay' and then never follow up. Over all it was a negative experience since I had to take PTO at my current job to go to the campus to have this strange experience. I heard the pay is around $40000/year. They talk highly of benefits but that is simply put: not a livable wage. I wouldn't have accepted an offer that low and wouldn't recommend this department to any of my colleagues searching for an opportunity.,0.995236,0.004502159,0.0002617902

Had the first interview simple. It was with the Helpdesk Manager  the director of operations and the manager of phone services. They asked me about my work history and why I was interested in the job. It was very laid back considering you were being analyzed by three different people. The first interview went well. Maybe a week later I had an interview with the Helpdesk manager again the lead technician and the Helpdesk coordinator. That's where I was asked the more technical questions. Also simple. The questions weren't difficult but they did move rather quickly when asking the questions (my guess is to see how quickly you can get the correct answer out).

This was for the Charlotte NC location. About a month after I applied I received a phone call asking me if I would still like to schedule an interview. Once I agreed the person then reviewed the position description with me. They added a lot of unnecessary details that would have been more appropriate for a second or final interview like getting free lunch sometimes etc. It felt like they were hesitating to tell me something. They then proceed to tell me what the salary for the position will be because it wasn't listed in the initial job posting. The figure they gave me was the lowest number I had heard since starting my job search. At that point I had applied to ~20 other places and was generally seeing salaries that were at least $10k higher. I then realized that they were calling people to schedule an interview because they wanted to weed out the people who wouldn't work for an extremely low salary in one of the fastest growing cities in the US and quickly declined the interview.,0.98590034,0.013859715,0.00023999005

"I felt compelled to write this review in hopes that others will be warned of the unprofessional circus act I endured during the hiring process. I received an email on a Wednesday from someone stating they were interested in interviewing me for that week Friday. It had been almost a full month since I had applied for the position. That same morning I emailed them back times I was available on Friday. I did not hear from them the rest of the day. Thursday rolls around and I am questioning why no one has informed me yet of the time of the interview. I decide on Thursday afternoon after not receiving an email to send an email myself. I stated how I had not received a time yet and how I felt scheduling an interview for tomorrow was too short notice for me. I also said they should notify me if they are no longer interested in interviewing me. Friday comes and goes with no communication. Days pass by and I no longer expect a reply back. After a whole seven days of no communication I receive an email. The person apologizes says my emails were ""caught in (her) junk folder"" and she is still interested in interviewing me. I don't believe emails just end up unwillingly in junk folders but alas I decide to reply back my availability for the following week for an interview. We decide on Tuesday of the following week giving me enough time to prepare. At the designated time of the interview I await the interviewer to call my cell phone as they stated they would do. A few minutes pass by after the scheduled start time and I double check our emails to make sure I was not supposed to call them. Soon a few minutes turn into ten minutes and then twenty minutes. It's obvious no one is going to call. Today went by without any communication from the person. They have no excuse or apology to give.",0.9986009,0.0012661747,0.0001329504

I applied online and was contacted three days later asking for a phone interview for the next day. I found it odd that the phone interview was taking place during a lunch hour. I was contacted five minutes late and one of the two interviewers had a somewhat arrogant attitude throughout the interview. She gave a sarcastic apology about calling late because according to her that's what happens when you do phone interviews. Let's just say I knew the minute I heard her name it was going to be a bogus interview because she knew a former coworker at my last employer.  She kept talking down to me and saying things I felt were a way to insult or antagonize me. I thought it was funny how she said I would have to be taught a few things regarding technology even though I graduated from a college that specializes in it and I have 20 years of experience using it but seeing as how I graduated so long ago things have changed and she was sure I would need to be trained. She also said in a snotty tone I would be working w/people who had doctorates and such as if to say I'd be working with people who were much smarter than me.  She told me they would be contacting people for a face to face the following week and having them come in the week after that and wanted someone to start immediately the beginning of February. Since she just told me what I wanted to know I didn't have any questions but she kept asking if I had any questions. What else should I have asked in a preliminary phone interview? Aren't you supposed to ask the important questions during the face to face?  I never heard back and trust me I was fine with that. Not only did Miss Personality waste my time with her rude and bogus interview I also read so many bad reviews on this site about what a terrible place it is to work.,0.9964893,0.0033504597,0.00016029607

One thing I will say is that during my teaching demo one of the search committee members was on their cellphone the ENTIRE timeliterally from before I started to the end. At first I thought it was a practicum in classroom management but realized that person really was just being rude. How can that person give me a fair score let alone a good one?

Hiring board won't turn the camera filming my teaching presentation (for someone?) towards the overhead that I'm using because the other candidates have used the white board.  So essentially they refused to film my teaching presentation.

The interview itself was really nice. Great vibe really positive experience. There was no HR involvement which I think really slowed down the process because the direct report was too bogged down with their job responsibilities to keep the hiring process moving along. I was then left on read with absolutely no updates for about two months. I followed up multiple times and received either a wishy washy response or no response at all. Finally was told an offer had been accepted by someone else. Pretty disappointed with how they handled the whole process post interview which I had thought went really positively.

Colleague recommended the position to me.  I filled out resume online & heard from HR within 1 week to set up interview.  The PI I interviewed with was friendly & personable.   Asked me about my experience  my role in my prior labs research projects & papers.   The PI went over their research interests & current projects.  I was then taken in a tour of the research department.  Every individual I met was friendly  seemed genuine and quite competent.   The facility's equipment was limited  not a surprise given its size (such as 2 high quality lab water units & 1 hood for the entire building) but a majority of it recent.  What was older was quite dated  some of the biosafety hoods were > 20 yrs with difficult to use metal sashes.

I refrained from inquiring about the university's benefits  advancement opportunities & other training opportunities for a followup interview if there was to be one.    I did find out that the interviewer contacted not only my listed references but researched my past labs' staff listing to contact some of them for their assesment of my performance (I'm not sure prospective emplorers are able to do that).

I was contacted after applying for a PR position. After applying I was sent an email for a date and time of an interview with zero flexibility. I reached out to HR to let them know their intended interview wasn’t going to work with my schedule since I was summoned to jury duty. I would let the hiring manager know if anything had changed. They sent back an email requesting me to change my time  but jury duty had not left the table. The day of the interview I was summoned to a trial missing the interview. HR had reached out to me to say ‘are you coming’ obviously no I had already made them aware of the situation. I asked for a Monday reschedule PHONE interview. The hiring manager then told me I made no effort to communicate any of the above  and that that day was the ONLY day they could possibly do an interview. I let her know that I see they value a body in a chair over the skill set of the hire since they couldn’t possibly be flexible and speak to me any other time. That is not how business is done in the real world and I would never work for this company who can’t even accommodate someone who has been summoned by the state for jury duty. Lack of flexibility and accountability  the hiring manager blaming me for her error after I was flexible with them and changed the time. I normally don’t even complain about scheduling conflicts  but this was beyond ridiculous. I was serving on a trial and now my consideration for a role is gone because they could only speak to me on one specific day and time.,0.9987834,0.001072408,0.00014424181
"I was already employed as an Adjunct (i.e. parttime) English Instructor so the Humanities Division Chair encouraged me to apply for the position of Developmental Reading Instructor (as it was a fulltime position). I filled out a standard application; submitted the required paperwork (teaching philosophy etc.); waited a few days; and then I was called in for an interview before the hiring committee. This committee included the Humanities Division Chair the head librarian a few professors (who had nothing to do with the position itself) the head of the Read Right program and the Academic Dean.The Committee was very cordial and professional and asked me standard/relevant interview questions (e.g. tell us a little bit about yourself list qualities an instructor should have why do you feel literacy is an important how would you handle a difficult student etc.) Afterwards I was set up for an interview with the college's president which I was told was just a formality but in all actuality it was nothing short of a sham interview. He was completely unprepared had no list of questions to run through and just asked me random questions came to his head. Most of the time was spent listening to him talk about himself his wife (a retired school teacher) and the history of the college and very little time was spent discussing the actual job or asking me relevant questions. Instead he asked rather prying questions such as where I went to high school; how many siblings I had; where my extended family (aunts uncles and cousins) lived and if they had gone to college (and if so what fields had they studied in and what did they currently do for a living); what colleges my parents attended; what degrees my parents had earned; and my parents' current professions. When he found out that one of my parents graduated high school chose not attend college and enter directly into the workforce that seemed to be the proverbial nail in the coffin. From that point on he acted completely disinterested in me and displayed a cold uncouth demeanor as he concluded the ""interview."" About a week later when I heard nothing about the job I inquired of my Division Chair who asked me if the president had even interviewed me. I said yes and she thought that was strange because during their hiring committee meetings she claimed he never even indicated that he had talked to me. Needless to say I didn't get the job but it was easily the worst interview I had ever been on (and I've been on some poorlyconducted interviews before). In retrospect I can only assume the college president was looking for a particular person a ""home town girl"" for lack of a better term to teach at his school. The overall experience was very insulting and left a poor impression on me as far as how the college's top administrators acted and treated others.",0.99487644,0.0049333903,0.00019023805

Poorly managed process. Had first interview over Zoomone member of the committee (the Chair) did not show up. The second interview on campus was generally fine and lasted from 9am to 9pm. A big red flag was that they did not know who I would report to if hired. I was asked to interview with another person a dean over Zoom once I returned home because it couldn't be arranged during the 12 hour campus interview. A member of the search committee asked about my references but never called them which is unusual and not typical for a professional interview. A month after the interview I emailed the chair reiterated my interest and asked about the search status. A full week later I received a reply from the chair that they were no longer chair (!!! shouldn't have been appointed chair in the first place then!!!) and that they had passed my email to someone else. I have not heard and it has been well over 2 months. HR should step in and establish professional norms for interviews.

The interview may be conducted in person over the phone or through a video conference. During the interview the interviewer will ask questions related to the applicant's experience skills and qualifications.

In November 2022 I began the interview process for the position of Executive Assistant to the Deans at Lesley College of Undergraduate studies. After a thorough and prolonged interviewing process it concluded on March 9th 2023. The interviewing process spanned several weeks: • Nov 15th Initial 30minute call with an associate dean • November 21st 3person panel zoom interview with a search committee chairs and another Executive Assistant. • December 9th I met with a dozen staff members over the course of three hours who conducted rotating 30minute interviews with me during an inperson panel interview which concluded with an hour interview with both Deans. • December 15th was then asked for information regarding my references and the references were contacted and provided details about my background and skill set. • From December 15th to January 3rd no communication efforts were made to contact me. • I inquired about salary and scheduling expectations on December 22nd but no information was shared with me. When I followed up I was told that salary information would be provided when an offer was made. I also asked about my direct support but received no response. • On January 20th I had a 45minute zoom interview with the Provost and President. • The offer was extended on February 23rd. When the offer was made the title and expectations of the role had changed. Due to the changes I requested a followup call with HR. I was scheduled for two followup calls within a 3week timeframe but both were canceled. On March 9th the offer was withdrawn and the position I was told was put on hold although the position was reposted on the careers page on the same day. This position remains posted on their careers page as of the date of this review. When I inquired about the role being “put on hold” and yet remaining on the careers page I was not given a direct answer. Throughout this lengthy interview process I maintained a professional and flexible attitude. However I would like to offer feedback and suggestions to the recruitment team at Lesley University to ensure that their recruitment efforts respect candidates' time and are equitable to all candidates. It is essential to offer a streamlined interview process that allows candidates to meet with their direct team and supervisors to provide insights into the daytoday expectations. Communication with candidates should be timely and clear and a designated contact person should be available to answer questions and provide straightforward answers. Recruitment turnaround time should be shortened to avoid miscommunication and the salary range should be posted in the requisition to attract qualified candidates. In conclusion I was disappointed with the interview process and would hope that professionalism and clear communication for future candidates is made a priority.,0.9966023,0.00325569,0.00014201053

The first interview consisted of four separate inperson interviews of about 2030 minutes in length with either one individual or a pair. It ended up being about 2 1/2 hours. After getting through the first round I was invited back for four more separate interviews of about the same length. It felt like the process dragged on because the interview slots available were over a two week period. Then a couple of weeks went by and the second round of interview slots were also over a two week period. I didn't hear anything back after the second round and after a month I received a snail mail rejection letter.,0.99834645,0.0015340083,0.00011951035

I am a former alum and I applied on 11/22/22. I reached out to former professors and connections HR and the CS director and shared my work portfolio. The school claims they support Lasallian values but I’m starting to believe that is false. Someone reached out on 12/20 for a brief phone screening and I was asked to join a zoom conference on 1/6. It was a panel interview with the supervisor and other admin. I felt inadequate but I hoped they could sense my genuine passion for the vocation. I was asked to come to Lewis for an in person interview. I arrived at 11:20 and I left around 3:18pm. There was a snowstorm but I was determined to be there interview. Prior to that I had a conference with the HR dept about all the amazing benefits insurance etc…we talked about an hour and I felt certain that meant I was a top choice. I gave a 10 min presentation in front of two different groups. I tried to share personal stories when I was a student. The last part involved about 18 individuals coming in  deans admin PC business dept etc firing long winded questions. I had to keep asking them to repeat themselves and my brain was on overload. This tripped me up. Being towards the end of the interview (going on 4 hours) I didn’t have the same tenacity and started to feel very intimidated. I can only imagine the things they said about my lack of experience and knowledge. I tried to write down everyone’s name and emailed EVERYONE a thank you the next morning. I even offered to volunteer for an upcoming career services event. I followed up 3x after that they kept telling me the interview process takes a long time. Today on 2/16 they shared they wanted to go in a different direction. They probably wanted someone more seasoned and didn’t have patience for helping an alum develop professionally.,0.99575764,0.0040379465,0.00020445301

Phone interview with the usual questions. I felt the HR person was the wrong one to be conducting the interview as I don't think one person can have an intimate understanding of the particulars of every position at the college.

The interview started with a phone call which was not scheduled. This was slightly alarming because it's always nice to be in the right headspace to get asked questions about a job I applied for.  It was then a long interview process with multiple people students etc.,0.9804129,0.019070808,0.00051621324
The interview process initially proceeded normally and I felt supported. Interviews were all conducted virtually including the two initial phone interviews 6 person panel interview and additional 3 person panel interview. After four interviews and being told I was one of only a few candidates left in the running I was informed that the school was dealing with covidrelated issues and they would follow up soon. I never heard from them again. I understand covid has added a very confusing layer to hiring processes but the complete lack of communication was very unprofessional. Furthermore the job was posted again months later and I was not contacted in any way and had to reach out to them first. This process was disorganized uncommunicative and unprofessional.,0.99798065,0.0018838217,0.00013547213

The interview process was simple there were few individuals who seemed uninterested. Fast forward through the interview I ended up with the Director for the department she was completely uninterested she would just look at me like a deer in headlights. She would not contribute to the conversation what so ever if I didn't ask a question we would just sit in silence. What a complete waste of time then I find out they hired a candidate with no higher education background what so ever. She has only been in higher education for less than five months and has no experience in the position she was hired for what so ever.  As well the candidate is an Alumni so what I am trying to say is if you want to work for Marist you need to be an alumni because  I have a Master's degree with 5 plus years of experience and they went with an Alumni who has ZERO higher ed experience and no Master's degree. Unethical hiring practices what a disservice to the students.,0.99847907,0.0013796121,0.0001412615

Wasn't really an interview. Whoever they call in gets hired they just give you a quick overview of the duties and ask you when you're available for training. Make sure to visit back often and you'll probably be contacted for an interview.,0.0006641904,0.9990558,0.00028001366

the interview process was a simple inperson interview.  we talked about only the things mentioned in my resume.  they checked our LinkedIn profile before calling for the interview. So a good profile is necessary to be considered,0.001653897,0.9883946,0.009951507
the interview was easy and relaxed. The interviewer said it was good interview and I made her comfortable. BUT..... She reminded me that a lot of people want to get into Marist ( good pay union and educational pursuits are free).  She said that many applicants are unemployed. Without coming out and directly saying it I was dead in the water because I was competing with unemployed applicants. So don't bother applying if you are employed. You may get lucky but the competition is great in this area at least for an Admin. Position. I walked away wondering why they even bothered calling me. It was obvious they will hire the qualified unemployed applicant first. Nothing wrong with that but don't get my hopes up folks.,0.0059160143,0.99194473,0.0021392338
The hiring manager called and asked what I like about the job and the job description  specifically. And she sort of did an ad hoc phone interview right on the spot.  Then set up a day to come in for an in person interview.  It was with a team from the office they had a printout of 1020 questions and just kind of went down the list and around the room asking the questions and feverishly writing down my responses.

The interview process was easy but that could be because I knew someone who was working there who put in a good word for me. The manager was really nice and he didn't really care if you had experience because you can learn everything you need to know by installing software on a flash drive.  Of course now I believe resent it under new management so the questions I was asked might be alittle differet.

Interview was extremely brief in duration my the standards of most academic interviews lasting only a few hours.  Met with Dean and faculty members had lunch in presentation room gave a research presentation had a debriefing brief campus tour and that was it.   In retrospect it was rather strange since there were no opportunities to meet and speak with students and no teaching presentation.  Lunch was catered by the college and served buffet style in the room in which the presentation was to be given.  Faculty members were somewhat obnoxious during the presentation  frequent interruptions; one faculty member fell asleep during the presentation so soundly that you could hear snoring from the back of the room.  Pretty low budget compared to most institutions.,0.998524,0.001337348,0.00013868223

I was selected to this job based on my communication skills and Academic GPA. While I was searching to find a job oncampus I walked into the dean's office where I had met my employer and handed over my resume and spoke well about my abilities to do a job like this. And my employer got impressed and had sent a request to one of my professors for an opinion and upon a positive reply from him about my capabilities they got me hired for this job.,0.0018981461,0.030195072,0.9679068

I then interviewed with all the staff members individually and/or in small groups.  I was interviewed in October but didn't get an offer until right before Christmas break for the university.  I was supposed to start at the beginning  of January for the Spring semester.  In the offer letter I was given a limited number of days to respond all of which the Dean's office was closed.

I interviewed for a position in the Humanities division of the college. It consisted of a standard 1.5day interview process with a lecture followed by Q&A individual meetings with staff members on campus (deans faculty) and a lunch/interview where they used a standardized 10question template to ask about teaching and research.,0.0009275067,0.99870884,0.00036356843
there were multiple interviewers which felt nervewracking but they made you feel very welcome the whole time. They described the position well with what duties would be required. They made me feel comfortable and not as nervous going into it.,0.002578505,0.9673939,0.030027634

This process took much longer than was necessary. I was called by a Human Resources representative at the end of August after applying for the job several times over the last year (I graduated from art college and figured MICA would be a good fit for me since I also worked in several departments at my art college). I called back twice the day I was contacted and reached the person's voicemail. I left two messages and received no calls back that day. I then called twice the next day leaving messages again. None of my calls were returned.   A week later I received an email from the representative that seemed as if they didn't receive any of my calls at all. She told me she was hoping to schedule a quick 30minute call. We did the call the following day. She asked pretty generic questions and when I asked about the job she couldn't tell me much about what it entailed (having worked in HR I understand you won't know every detail about every job description but you at least have a decent idea).   Overall the entire process seemed a bit disorganized. My phone interview was July 24th and I didn't receive anything back about the job until today September 4th. I know a lot of jobs will either never get back to you or send a generic response if you didn't make the cut but I didn't feel that this interview could even be considered as such.,0.9966048,0.003240311,0.00015496749

Teaching classes was also not apart of the job announcement. I explained my reasoning for my career goals and I was encouraged to look into teaching more specifically with their program. Interview completed and I was told that a decision would be made over the next few weeks or so.  A little puzzled about the lackluster answer as I felt as though they were in a hurry (based on emails) to fill the position and schedule me for an interview. Very strict/rigid timeline provided for interviewing.  Received reject email a few weeks later thanking me and suggesting that I consider faculty positions.,0.04959992,0.94840604,0.0019939775

Fill out a form including 2 references. The form is what they use to decide if you are mostly qualified.

The interview process went well until they became vague at the end and did not update me on what their timeline was for hiring. I drove five hours for an in person interview all for them to not have the decency to notify me about when they were planning to make a decision. They never got back to me after this interview.,0.9961755,0.003535786,0.00028865345
There were initially 34 rounds of interviews one with the Director another with students  and another within the college community. It was very straightforward and much needed to invest in the best candidate that they needed.,0.0010010443,0.99856585,0.00043318918

This institution is a for profit school masquerading as a private institution. It was a great interview; I enjoyed the time I spent with the individuals who interviewed me. However they were putting on airs about what the job was and what they were selling in terms of the position. I had read glassdoor prior to applying for the job so I went into the interview knowing what to expect. It is all about numbers with Mercy they do not care about the quality of students. It is all about the quantity they want/expect you to be beyond flexible with your schedule. I was told the position would be 95 they informed me I would need to do weekends and sometimes adjust my schedule to work at least 23 days a week hours such as 128. The admissions department is out of control; they are running that department as if it was a business. They have over 40 employees in the department who all come from a business background with no higher education knowledge or experience. It is a group think mentality it’s all about meeting your numbers. During the interview they also indirectly asked me if I had other applications out and if I was interviewing with other institutions. They wanted to make sure that they were going with a candidate that was going to commit to Mercy because individuals have accepted in the past went through training and then left because they received another offer. If you want to work in higher education I would stay away from this school they are a for profit school. As well you would be reporting to assistant directors who have little to no experience in higher education and  were only hired because of nepotism. I have yet to hear back from Mercy on the position.,0.9966871,0.002803697,0.0005091834
I participated in phone interview and then skype interview. I was offered a skype interview because I lived on the other side of the country. I appreciated their flexibility. For the skype interview I was asked questions by both my manager and the VP of Student Affairs. The overall experience was very positive and they asked targeted questions that sought to identify my goals and whether I would be a good fit for the college. The college highly values their mission. It was very important to depict how I would fit into the mission.,0.0017625281,0.18235756,0.8158799

I was called by a member of the team where she told me more about the position and asked to set up a phone interview. One was scheduled however when it came time for the interview I sat waiting for a call. 15 minutes later I reached out the the person who initially contacted me and left a message as there was no answer.

Absolutely horrendous. The entire interview process was a joke. Between having both of my skype interviews rescheduled last minute (literally minutes before my interview) and having each interview barely last 15 minutes the entire process just seemed extremely unprofessional.

Human Resources Dept. had no idea this position needed filling; online application form was an illogical antiquated nightmare suitable only for those who stayed in the same job or same kind of job for years at a timelike in the 1950s!

I was contacted about a month after submitting my application with an initial phone screening with HR which was pretty basic and pleasant. Just verifying your information you provided and expanding on it a little. About two days later I was contacted by email for an inperson interview on campus the following week.  I was instructed in the email that I would be meeting with Sarah from HR and Dr. Smith from the department. (Fake names provided for anonymity's sake but this part is rather important)    The first interview occurred with HR and was very friendly and welcoming including rather typical interview questions. This part took about an hour and was breezy and pleasant.  Next we traveled to the department who the position was with. I met with Dr. Smith out in the hallway and he was perfectly friendly shook my hand and lead me into the interview room... with 4 other individuals in it. This immediately threw me off as the email made it sound as if I was only meeting with one individual whose work I had researched and for which I was prepared for. I was completely unaware this would be a panel interview but I tried to roll with it.   Of the other 4 people one was friendly two were neutral and the last one was 5 minutes late and refused to introduce himself to me during introductions. They went around the room and asked questions about my background relevant to their projects some questions were rather straightforward but there were a few that were unexpected (provided below). A few questions were about my experience in the past and what I did some were about how I felt my skills would transfer to specifics of their research and how I handle multiple projects at a time. Oh except the guy who arrived 5 minutes late.  He asked me seemingly irrelevant questions that seemed to poke fun at me as a person and my intelligence rather than to evaluate me as a legit candidate. This helped increase the edge and create an awkward environment that the others seemed to be picking up on as well.  Honestly I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt at first thinking maybe it was just his demeanor or it was all in my head but as the interview progressed the condescending tone became prevalent in all his comments. I also noticed that he glared at me without breaking gaze throughout the interview which was extremely uncomfortable. At the end he informed me that it was unprofessional that I had not researched every single PI in the room and knew exactly who they were and what work they had done before showing up. I am no stranger to the scientific community and the expectations of it so while I absolutely agree in theory for this situation I did my due diligence for the individual I was under the impression I would be meeting with.  The next part was a tour of the lab area. The lab manager showed me around the facility introduced me to lab assistants and other employees and asked me a round of questions himself. He was super down to earth and relaxed so these questions were not difficult at all.  I think in total the whole process lasted about 4 hours. I have been in the professional world for 10 years and through countless interviews on the job hunt for the majority of this year. I have never left an interview with tears of frustration before.    I was told by Dr. Smith himself that I would be contacted about the position no matter what the decision about my candidacy. It's been 4 months. I'm assuming I didn't get the job.,0.5102588,0.48845407,0.0012871181
Set aside a whole day. I've never had a longer interview in my life.

1) Application  Go through the website first and answer the questions. Sit down for at least 1 hour to complete.  2) InBasket Test  Every few months MiraCosta College's Human Resources department hosts an inbasket test. If you've been a secretary or administrative assistant before it means you're doing your (former) job within 60 minutes. It's not a test to study for. You get a packet of calendars schedules memos and emails with a list of tasks to complete within the 60 minutes. I passed it by using Stephen Covoy's Matrix of Time Management. I didn't finish everything but if I got 28 or better I passed. You won't know you passed until you get an email from Human Resources within the following week.  3) Interview 1  After passing the inbasket test the application review committee looks for the best candidates from the alreadydwindled applications. If they like yours they'll call you a month later and let you know about the interview. This first interview has a skills test for Excel and/or Word along with writing an email to an important person offcampus. It's not a strenuous Excel test like doing mail merge or making graphs. It requires mostly beginner or elementary level Excel and Word knowledge. You only get 25 minutes for the test. Afterwards you get several minutes to review the group interview questions before you meet and interview with the panel.   4) Interview 2  Once you've gotten a call back for an interview that same week you'll meet with a smaller group maybe only 3 people who will work directly in that department or division. They ask several questions and really get to know you as a person. It's to see if you personally fit in with the work culture.   5) Job Offer  By the end of the day you should know if you get the job or not.,0.4662494,0.5320182,0.0017323932
"The process began with an secretarial ""inbasket"" test. It is required that you pass the test before they will even consider your application. The test is taken by all of the applicant in one room.

Just a note: The test is extremely hard. I have been an Administrative Assistant at a different school for four years and I was shocked to find that I did not pass.

My interview involved three different stages scheduled over multiple days:  Stage 1: (a) Wrote a short essay on a discipline related topic (30 minutes); (b) read the committee interview questions and took some notes (30 minutes); (c) answered committee questions (50 minutes); (d) asked my own prepared questions (10 minutes).  [Positive experience]  Stage 2: Delivered a 25 minute teaching demonstration to 4045 students in a campus classroom.  The committee assigned the topic in advance.  [Positive experience]  Stage 3: Met with two faculty members from the original search committee and an administrator via Skype (3045 minutes).  [Negative experience]  Note: You had to be advanced from one stage to the next.  Here's what bothered me about interviewing at Mt. SAC:  1. I don't think the administrator conducted herself in a professional manner during the third stage.  Instead of exploring my qualifications she asked some tangential questions that came off like she wanted to find something wrong with me instead of getting to know me.  Next when I spoke about relevant work experiences  that I believe the college would benefit from (e.g. course development) she appeared rather disinterested (e.g. looking away from the screen).  2. Human Resources contacted my current supervisor before they decided who they wanted to offer the position to (note: this happened between stages two and three).  Needless to say this created an awkward situation for me at the school where I currently teach.  3. When Human Resources initially called me they never mentioned that I would have to visit the campus twice.  Luckily they made other arrangements to use Skype for the third stage (which I totally appreciated) but I had to inquire multiple times to confirm this would happen.  Also I communicated with at least four different people in HR and I don't know how well they communicate with each other.  Takeaway:  I clicked with the search committee and my teaching demonstration went over well with the students but I sense that the administrator made the final decision.  What's odd about this is that she never saw me teach a lesson.  You'd think that someone who's so concerned about students would want to see you in action.  Overall I had a good experience with most of the people I encountered at Mt. SAC.  That said I can't say I would apply if they have another opening because the leadership left me with a bad feeling about the whole process.,0.93850666,0.061171126,0.0003221758

They seems very organized(I have had job interviews with employers that seems extremely disorganized and almost too eager to give me a job) The NYFA HR team on the other hand were extremely professional friendly but didn't give ""false hope"" that you killed the interview or used wording that would imply you got the job.

Other than that the actual interview itself is simple took place at the burbank ca location. They asked a lot of questions that had nothing to do with the job itself and had little information to give you because they couldn't find a location to house everyone.

I applied for the position online and was contacted by someone in the HR department a day or two later to schedule an interview. When I arrived a few minutes early for my interview I assumed I would be waiting for the hiring manager until my scheduled interview time. However I was waiting and waiting and waiting for almost 45 minutes. Finally I was greeted by the person who scheduled my interview. She brought me to a theater where I would be meeting the hiring manager. This person stalled... and stalled... until she texted and tried calling the hiring manager multiple times to then tell me that the hiring manager was stuck in a meeting. I eventually met with someone else in the HR department instead who was professional in interviewing me but told me that this particular position I applied for would be to replace her. Overall it seems like their HR Department is a mess with absolutely no semblance of organizational or prioritization skills. If an interviewer shows up at his or her scheduled time ready to interview with the interviewer as scheduled it is completely disrespectful to leave the interviewee hanging. Ultimately it is absolutely wrong that I didn’t even meet with the hiring manager at all after I traveled all the way there and waited almost an hour past my interview time to even begin interviewing with someone whose perspective on me won’t even matter because she won’t be with the company shortly. I was not even sent a follow up or apology after that experience. My first impression and experience with NYFA was awful and telling. I urge everyone to stay far far away. I’m glad I didn’t get the position.,0.99848735,0.0013677847,0.00014487669

"I was invited to come in for an interview met with one of the senior admission staff members for about 35 minutes. That interview went well and she was very nice and seemed excited about my résumé and experience. They told me the job was for an ""Admission Specialist"" role and that they needed help in their recruitment tactics and their overall admission process. I was invited to come in for a second interview which was also fine again with another senior admission staff member. Felt like a standard interview. After that interview I was brought upstairs to meet with the President. He was late to the interview and the interview took place in his office on this really low couch which was weird to me and it was so loud because the room was next to a dance studio so I was super distracted/couldn't concentrate on the questions. I offered him my resume after introducing myself so he could have a copy to look over and he declined saying he'd already looked at it earlier. He then asked me where I'd gone to college and questions about my work experience that could be found on my resume. It was such a weird interview and I got such weird vibes from him and he just kept talking about how wonderful he is and how NYFA is not as prestigious as where I had gone to college or where I had previously worked and that he understood where I was coming from because he had gone to Harvard and that this would be different but that people really give it their all here etc etc. That should have been my first red flag. I was offered the position later that week and negotiated the salary up by 510K I believe. But when they sent me the official offer they had changed the job title without telling me and informed me my working hours would be from 11:30AM8PM which they had never mentioned during the interview process. I ended up accepting the job but quit shortly thereafter because it was not the right fit for me and it felt like a baitandswitch.

"I received an email from someone in the HR department asking me for a 30minute phone interview for the position. I responded letting them know my availability.   I felt that for an initial phone conversation that some of the questions asked were pretty intense. At the end of the interview I asked two questions  ""What thing (or things) do you like most about working at North Central College?"" and ""How are incidents of conflict handled within the department?"" I noticed when I asked them the second question that they seemed a bit hesitant to answer that/offended by the question.  They then told me that the next step would be to interview with some members of the team and the hiring manager/tech lead and they would follow up with more information. Several weeks after I had sent a note of thanks after the initial conversation I reached out since I never heard anything else. I received a generic response that if the hiring manager wanted to speak with me they had my information and would reach out to me if anything further was needed.

I applied online for their campus security position. It isn't campus police it's litterally the equivalent of mall cop.  On their application they didn't specify what the pay was but it was 12 USD at the time of me writing this. They won't negotiate and they don't state it so they can make a candidate pool. Also they don't specify how many hours you'd work but guarantee less than 30 hours.  Which the pay is lousy and the hours are bad. Especially if you have experience.  About 1 week latter they contact me doing some phone interview out of nowhere. Then they tell me to come in person. I ended it there because I didn't realize the pay and hours were THAT bad.

I applied online and received a phone call to schedule an interview time within two weeks of applying. The interview was very uncomfortable as it felt that neither of the interviewers actually wanted to be there. It consisted of about 810 questions and took around 15 minutes. Neither interviewer shook my hand on the way out nor did they tell me when I could expect to hear anything from them (either positive or negative). One interviewer offered to walk me out but she just opened the office door and pointed me towards the main door and told me to exit that way. A week later I checked the application status online and that's how I figured out that I wouldn't hear back from them. The whole experience felt very unprofessional and I don't think I would have taken the job if offered.,0.99775094,0.002102699,0.00014640651

I applied online and was contacted a few weeks later for an interview. The interview was over Skype and I had 4 people on my interview committee. The interview lasted about 45 minutes and I was surprised that it was that short and there were no follow up interviews.

I applied through Human Resources but also sent emails to the deans of the relevant departments probably six because there are six campuses.

The interview was really easy and enjoyable. The manager called me for a one on one interview and then called me back a week or so later that they wanted to hire me.

I applied online for a newly created fulltime faculty position.  Several weeks later I received an email invitation for a video interview.  You set up your computer to use camera and microphone then access the interview within a 5day window.  There are 5 video questions and you have about 3 minutes to give a video response.  You get two attempts at each question.  This was not made clear (only that you would have multiple attempts).  If you want to preview a question then pause to compose a response you only have one response attempt remaining.  I did not like the video interview because it is onesided.  I feel that if I am going to invest myself in the process I should get something back at every step such as the ability to ask a question or get a feel for what kind of place it is.  I put some effort into the video interview but I deliberately did not strive to present my best due to it being onesided.  Several weeks later I received an invitation to interview with the committee and I was told that I would deliver a 15minute lecture to students and compose a writing sample.  The choices of interview dates and times was very narrow.  I was not available for any of the time slots but I negotiated a different interview date by email.  Upon arrival I had a 15 minute interview with an administrator then I was taken to a classroom full of students and the committee where I delivered my lecture.  The 15 minute limit was enforced strictly.  The students were dismissed and asked to prepare their evaluations which they deposited outside the door while I was interviewing with the committee.  The actual interview was about average.  I would call it a positive experience.  The committee had members from three or four disciplines and they seem like colleagues that I would want to work with.  At the conclusion of the interview I was told that I would be contacted in a week and I was escorted to the writing center where my writing prompt was waiting.  I was given a copy of my writing sample before I left.  I was never contacted and now three months have gone by.  The position status is still pending although the fall semester is about to begin in 23 weeks.  Six weeks after the interview I contacted HR and they said that I was still a candidate and the matter was still in the hands of the committee.  Some committees are slow and HR has no control over that they said.  I think it is unprofessional for my contacts to leave me hanging for all of this time with no followup or explanation about the status.  I can only conclude that the administration is not serious about filling this position and that the institution probably has low regard for its faculty.,0.99784386,0.0019923768,0.00016375587

Four interviews over three months and inappropriate due to being made a verbal offer as well as given reassurance by those above the person I would be reporting to. It was his final decision to pass.

Emailed to set up preliminary phone interview with HR lasted about 15 minutes.

I was approached by someone associated with the school. After communicating by email filling out the application and providing quite a bit of specialized documentation a phone interview was scheduled. This phone interview was rescheduled then the rescheduled time was just blown off and then they called me without warning while I was at work. This call was about a month after they first received my resume. Over the course of this interview it became clear that what they wanted was exactly the opposite of my experience and the interviewer told me that they had another applicant they preferred and spoke of that person's work experience admiringly.

I applied online and a couple of days later HR called me to speak briefly about the position and we setup an interview for me to come in to meet with the Registrar.  The Registrar lady seemed to be laughing during the interview and at that moment I wanted to walk out but I kept my cool.  Why are you interested in the Academic Records Specialist position and how this position fits into your future professional goals? Asked how I liked working in my previous job. Asked about the skills in my last position and how I felt that they would transition into the role of an Academic Records Specialist. Was I responsible for data entry student files and scanning in my last position? What was the most challenging and complex project you handled at work? What part of the project required you to go above and beyond your usual resources? What is diversity to you and how would you incorporate that to create that environment that is inclusive to our school? In your last job what was the population of the student body like? What advice would you give someone working in a Customer Service role for the first time? What's your ideal learning environment at work? In terms of supervision do you like to work independently or do you like someone to check in a lot? What's the best compliment you've received for your work style? And a criticism you have received for your work style? What qualities do you value most in coworkers and what qualities do you find challenging? Have you had a work experience where you've found a coworker somewhat challenging and if you did how'd you overcome that? How do you handle multiple task and projects? Do you have any tools that you use to keep yourself on track? Could you describe an issue you've had to handle at work and how did you react to that? How comfortable are you with technology?,0.16780421,0.83173805,0.0004578242

Ozark Technical Community College's procedure is to have a panel of 3 men and 3 women. They have a list of questions from which to choose each of the 6 choose which questions they want to ask they narrow it down to a handful for each person and they each read the question round robin. There is an opportunity at the end to add anything you want but it is not an interview that flows naturally and I believe that is because it's a committee.,0.9973183,0.0025327161,0.00014897302

Typical Academic Interview however the job posted stated that faculty may occasionally be asked to assist with the forensics team but almost every interview question was about literal coaching experience.

Very rigid interview structure. Went into a room for 15 minutes to prepare preselected 10 questions. Then I was shown into a room with about 10 faculty members who read through the questions in order. No followup questions were asked. Part of the 10 questions was a fifteen minute teaching demo which had to be done with absolutely no technology. I had use of the whiteboard and could provide a onepage handout. Overall I had a positive experience and everyone was very nice. I didn't make it to the second round and I would have liked a less rigid interview structure. For instance it would have been nice if any of the committee members would have offered followup questions; however I understand that HR may not have allowed them to do that.,0.007491986,0.9919133,0.0005946952

The email describing the interview process deemed the interview rigorous which led me to spend hours preparing not only personal documents (resume etc.) but also a presentation (including a PowerPoint Presentation and a leaflet). The interview process included a written section to be completed on MS Word 5 minutes to review interview questions a 30 minute interview and a final presentation. All of that would have been fine if not for the stale & disengaged interview committee. It seemed like no one wanted to be there and that they in fact already had a candidate whom they wished to hire. A huge waste of time! Do better Palomar.,0.99798137,0.0018651858,0.00015349404

Application was submitted online in April did not receive a call for recruitment until the end of September. My interview was scheduled 3 weeks later. Went in for first interview with 6 committee members as interviewers. They gave me a skills assessment and then 10 minutes to prep answers for about 16 questions. They said I would know that afternoon (this was a Friday) if I was picked for the second round. Received a call the next Monday for the final round interview and was asked to come in the next day because they said there was only one time to meet me. Had the second interview this time with only 3 committee members. Again I was told I would find out within 24 hours but did not receive the final decision until 2 weeks later (I had to call and email HR who only responded to one of my emails).,0.9952247,0.0046701482,0.00010507537
Began with a written question and thirty minutes to complete. The interview was very rushed and did not give much a chance to go into depth about experience and knowledge outside of technical. Very strict and regimented interview. When I asked questions they were shrugged off without a answer just 'you don't need to worry about that part of the job description' and similar reactions to any questions.,0.9981108,0.001754315,0.0001349137
The interview process was not lengthy or too challenging. The company was great to work for. HR made the hiring process fairly easy and straightforward. This job provided a great learning experience for me. My supervisor was great at preparing me for this position.,0.00035637218,0.00039646297,0.9992472
Although the process took a long time from the application to the first interview everyone in the process was extremely professional and after the first interview things happened quickly.  First interview was written test followed by panel interview. Second interview was just a panel with my questions (about 10).  Overall very positive experience with everyone in the process.,0.0037891103,0.8328435,0.16336739

I had my interview over Skype and it was relaxed. It lasted for about 1hr and we basically just discussed history. What I want to teach it what about it do I feel most comfortable. Very easy interview. The Interviewer was very easy going and I think that really took the pressure off of me. It was a historian talking to another historian so we talked more about history than the actual job which I didn't mind at all.,0.0021978172,0.9342411,0.06356114
The department and HR seem pretty incompetent. They mostly just hire from the local colleges (hard to attract outside talent when you don't pay for interview expenses). The department required so much materials and I don't believe they actually looked over most of it.,0.99901736,0.00082723354,0.00015540265
I applied online and received a call from HR to set up an inperson interview with the hiring committee. The interview process is very organized. The HR person sent me a detailed itinerary for the interview which included a 15 minute test 10 minutes to review the interview questions and 30 minutes for the actual interview itself. While organized I felt like the entire process was extremely rushed. I checked in on the day of the interview then was escorted quickly to a different building  and handed the test before I even had a chance to catch my breath. After the test and question review I was then escorted to another area where I met with the hiring committee. When I entered the room everyone looked extremely bored and no one even greeted me. I had to be the first to say hi and introduce myself. It was very offputting. The interview itself was fine they have the question list visible on the table in front of you but each committee member goes around and reads the questions aloud. Before the interview started they made a point of telling me that there was only 30 minutes for the interview so I had to keep my answers fairly short. This made it difficult to actually share my qualifications to the full extent because I was so nervous about going over time. I understand that they had a schedule of interview to get through but their unfriendliness and the fact that I was rushed through everything did not make it an enjoyable experience.,0.99813443,0.0016975219,0.00016817683
It was a group interview and we were being questioned by one of the managers. At one point since there were about 6 people in the group everyone started repeating answers and running out of things to say. It became a competition of who could say the essential elements the fastest; those who didn't ended up looking like a fool because the manager was insistent that everyone talk.,0.9832804,0.016496241,0.00022326648
Overall it was a good experience.  They allow the interviewee to review the questions to be asked for 10 minutes prior to the interview itself.  The questions depend on the position being applied for.  In my experience they were not difficult.  A committee conducts the interview which takes about 45 minutes.,0.008376238,0.4193632,0.5722605
Found the job advertisement on their website and on craigslist. I faxed my application and was invited to a group interview where a set questions on a sheet are asked.

I called and was told by a receptionist I had not gotten the position but was also asked about being an alternate if interested. A week or so later I received a call from the program's office lead asking if I was interested in an opening they had and I accepted. Background check was highly time consuming.

"I was contacted by Park University shortly after applying online. They conducted a phone interview with me and then proceeded with an onsite interview the following week.

However I was more than qualified for the position.   When I walked into the Admin. Office all of the employees were middleaged and older women. I could automatically tell that there was a ""click"" type atmosphere in the office. The interview itself went well. Typical interview but we just sat around in a circle with no table inside a small personal office (odd).   A week after my interview I was called and told that I was not selected for the position. This was a shock but after reading other reviews of the college on Glassdoor I knew why I was not selected. Turns out they hired another middleaged woman to fit in with their group.

Had to bring a college transcript to the interview to go over then asked a few questions about my current and previous courses and whether or not I could balance school and work.

There was no real interview process. I was referred to the position by a friend and the interview was with the director it took only 20 minutes. I kind of already knew I had the job it was more of an official meeting with the director,0.0005817396,0.99883634,0.0005819255
You have to first apply at the specific department with the opening and speak to the person in charge of the hiring process for it. As for the interview itself it's usually that one individual that will most likely be your main boss that will be asking the questions. He/she will ask about your interests reasons and qualifications. Then you will be told you will hear from him/her in the next few weeks or you may even be hired on the spot. Then you will be sent to another office on campus to submit your digital fingerprints next to  HR to fill out paperwork and finally the dean of the department will have to sign your form to have it approved.,0.022207147,0.97755176,0.00024105344

The interview process was pretty typical. First there was an interview with HR with basic questions. Then there was an interview with the hiring manager and I was asked standard scenario questions and about previous projects I have worked on.

Phone interview with recruiting then virtual interview with manager.  They seemed to be looking for something very specific.  In my case it seemed like we were mutually uninterested. Seems to be a very sterile academic environment.,0.9959488,0.003944145,0.00010703266
Series of 30minute interviews with various team members. The interview style varied a lot but all were very general. Many of the same questions are asked by different people. I felt unclear about the position throughout the process. I never really gained clarity about what the job entailed and who I would be working with because I talked to so many different people from different parts of the company. When I was declined an offer I asked for feedback and did not receive any.,0.9965186,0.003373121,0.000108218315
The process was incredibly drawn out due to an organizational change (?) I had to request feedback and follow up after every interview. After my final interview the job was being moved to a different manager so this further delayed the process by two additional weeks. The manager reached out to alert me that the original salary that I was told was incorrect and that I would be offered $12k less than my salary requirement.  A complete and utter waste of my time and energy.,0.9990408,0.0008173705,0.00014185264
"This is a continuation of past interview already posted on here for the Student Advocate position. Continuing on... After scheduling a video chat interview with HR for the next business day the video chat occurred at the time scheduled. There were two of them on the video chat. They were friendly and took turns asking questions. The interview did not last too long either. It was fewer than 30 minutes in length maybe about 15 minutes or so. It is helpful to search interview questions in advance and write your answers out to have them already handy. It also helps to have a copy of your resume to reference. Following the interview I received a job offer via email in under 24 hours as well as the paperwork for the completion of a background check. The background check took less than one day and subsequently I was emailed by HR within a few hours with the new hire paperwork to fill out and sign along with appropriate handbooks and other relevant informative paperwork. Upon completing the requirements on my end I was informed of a future shipment to be arriving for me via mail (I believe possibly a ""work"" laptop or any other relevant things required to have). Upon receiving said shipment then one would refer back to the email from HR with all the paperwork which includes a document that specifies the setup process for the laptop. After this you will be contacted by a couple more people to ensure you are set up prior to the first day of work. At some point during the first second or maybe third day you will be required to display via video chat the documentation used for identity verification during the hiring process. And finally the first three weeks will be training for the position. Your start date will be day 1 of said training. And your start date basically just depends on what date the next training class is started for new hires. (My start date was set for approximately 1.52 weeks after the background check and hiring process was completed  this time amount is needed for receiving the aforementioned shipment and getting set up properly!)",0.0067215953,0.43432045,0.55895793

Overall the experience was positive. Although I realized during the interview with the CMO that I wasn’t going to be selected. The HR person was absent for more than a week and suddenly sent an email saying he will have updates next week as they are going through the interview process. He did come back 2 days later and said they were selecting other candidates with more B2C experience. That’s fine I felt that the email was sent just to be keep me warm as a backup candidate. Seeing that this role is still unfilled at this time I would suggest this company scale down the requirements. No one is going to be an expert in data science and google analytics/google tag manager and also knowledgeable about bridging multiple data sources to do reporting across multiple marketing channels. Even if someone like that exist I am pretty sure they are well compensated in much better situation and not considering employment in a smaller company. Be realistic in your expectations. Anyone claiming to know all of these is sure selling you snake oil.,0.040657066,0.95872545,0.0006174905

I interviewed with the head of the human resources department. During the interview he apologized several times for looking at the wrong copy of my resume (I had previously applied for different positions and he had two copies of my resume). He asked me to go through each of my past jobs and tell him how I knew it was time to leave each and concluded the interview by saying that he had not realized how long I have been at my current position and that he felt my experience was not a match. The overall implication was that he has realized relatively quickly that he felt I was not a match but he allowed the interview to continue. At no point was there a break that would have allowed me to ask questions of my own. Overall the interview ended feeling like it had been mostly a waste of both our time—he had not read my resume beforehand was not sure which copy of it he should be looking and referenced the incorrect position for my current role several times. He knew early on he would not be offering a second interview and still continued to ask questions allowing the interview to continue for no reason.,0.9972518,0.0026223606,0.0001258037

The building needs updates as do the programs that are offered to the students but that's a whole other story. It's like they are stuck in 1985.

"The interview was solely with a male Employee Services staff person with no one from my future relevant department present and after hire I found out that my future team leader was not even privy to my resume or any skills or experience in it. Nor ever after as well. I have found out afterward that the Employee Services Department wields incredible power at this organization and is quite inflexible and lacking in member care  the number one trait desired in employees is compliance. With hiring at PCC the priority seems to be filling an empty position and total compliance to the Employee handbook vs. what are your skills and how would you benefit the organization and vice versa. Forget career progression possibilities. You are shown a high quality informative video presentation of the organization's history and founders. Church attendance at the oncampus Campus Church is absolutely a job requirement and you will fill in attendance slips each week (and they are checked by HR) so forget personal choice or responsibly choosing your own place of worship. During the interview it felt like signing on here was relinquishing much of my personal dignity and freedom of choice in exchange for a paycheck. Much of this was explained as necessary due to it being a ministry  never mind that to a Christian every job they always work at is/should be automatically that. Also of concern should be the fact that every fulltime hire is for at least a oneyear contract even for all support jobs and the explanation is that your leaving would impact the school schedule. And if you happen to not be applying exactly before the start of the Fall semester then they'll tack on the remainder of that year until July PLUS one year. Because they can. There is no negotiating anything or flexibility within the interview  which is an accurate preview of the overall work environment that follows. Also although the company can terminate you with a normal 2 weeks notice all employees must not only give a 6month notice (in January) but can only then leave in July (when all employee contracts stop/restart) without being considered a ""contractbreaker"".

Interview with Vice President of Academic Affairs. It was fairly easy and honestly has very little bearing on whether you will be accepted unless you graduated from somewhere else as it is all based on your standing as an undergrad.

Although some departments need to work on implicit hiring biases we all have them.

"I received an email the day I applied inviting me to interview for a job that I didn't apply for. Received another email right after correcting the mistake. Set up a time for a phone interview. Waited for 45 minutes and did not receive a call. Contacted the person who set up the interview and she said the hiring manager was free now or on Friday. I was a little turned off and didn't respond. On Friday I got a call even though I did not confirm the time for an interview. The next week the initial person I dealt with emailed me saying I missed my phone interview (even though I never confirmed it) and was I still interested?  About a month later I get a call/email from a student worker looking to set up my second interview! Very strange. I understand making mistakes and running late but this just seemed beyond disorganized and also having someone wait for 45 minutes without calling them doesn't show that they feel their time is important. This position also had a lot of responsibility but was low balled with the ""coordinator"" title so that it would pay less.

The interview process was extensive and extremely drawn out for a Director level position. It was posted in July and that's when I had my first interview with the head of the department via Zoom. Great initial convo and clear direction for the department.   One of the clear problems with this interview process was the lack of communication. Several weeks would go by with no response to emails then you'd hear from them with another round of interviews scheduled followed by 3 more weeks of silence. This went on from July  November.  In total I had 8 interviews in a 4 month time span for this position.  3 interviews with the head. 3 group interviews and 2 single interviews. All an hour each via zoom.  Another offputting thing was I heard from a former colleague that the head of the department had cold called one of my old jobs asking for candid feedback but from someone who was not employed there when I was. Had this person asked I would have been happy to provide my previous supervisors information.   Lastly after being told by the head that they'd be making their decision on a Monday that Wednesday I received an email from Pomona HR asking for my references. This was the first time HR was ever involved in the entire 4 month process. Again complete silence after they were completed for 2 more weeks only to find out I did not get the position.   To summarize they have a huge communication problem and their hiring process needs to be severely reviewed. HR should be included much earlier in the process. Do not string along multiple candidates for several months in the middle of a pandemic.,0.99854624,0.0012896995,0.00016405096

The amount of paperwork they required was extensive; I had to pay to have transcripts sent even from institutions I attended over 10 years ago. The worst however was a weeklong online training that was tedious patronizing and at times disquieting (it seemed like they were trying to figure out how to get as much out of instructors as possible without paying them any additional income). It was just hoop after hoop and then with days until the semester started they came back to me and said they did not actually have anything for me to teach.

I applied online and 1 week later received a phone call from HR. The HR conducted a phone interview in which she asked 5 questions about my resume past experiences and why would I want to work at an Online University rather than a real one. Was also asked salary range but was informed it's capped at $35000. I then got setup for an in person interview that week. I met with this lady with a spray tan and another with a ponytail so tight I could read her mind. They kept emphasizing this is more of a sales job but that there are no quotas...They also asked how competitive I am though I don't see how trying to help students get an education is a competitive sport. Lastly they asked about my personal life and explained it's because there are cliques and groups in the department and they want to know which social circle they would stick me in.,0.9710391,0.028761782,0.00019907598

Brief phone interview and then in person interview with HR and 2 managers.  Not an overly welcoming environment when interviewing.  Standard inside sales type questions were asked with a couple tough ones thrown in.  I answered them thoroughly and with a lot of thought but did not get an offer.  They did also mention that the position requires at least 100 outbound phone calls per day.  Sounded to me like more of a high pressure sales job than admissions.,0.9965868,0.0032634933,0.00014974098

"Working around creatives at an art school would be amazing for me so I've jumped at both opportunities I've had to interview for positions in the Institutional Advancement department which encompasses development communications and inhouse graphic design for the Institute. Both times I've made it to the final candidate rounds of interviews and both times the final experiences have left a bad taste in my mouth.   The hiring managers are quite thorough in their interviews  you will often undergo a phone screening and then an initial interview where you are asked for more specific details about your resume and work experience which then begins to move into your values and work style. This last time I was interviewed for a writer position in the department and my final interview round was with the three executives I would be writing for (not working directly with) who conducted the interview interrogation style. I felt like I was taking a test or defending a thesis.   Despite that I was still excited for the potential the position held and the environment  this also despite the pitifully lowballed salary the Institute was offering.  After numerous correspondences with the hiring manager and then reaching the end of the interview process I wrote once more to inquire about my candidacy either way. My message was met with silence which seemed odd after everything else. The following week I received a generic form letter in the mail notifying me that they had ""chosen another candidate . . . "" whose experience better matched the role.    Disgusting.   After multiple rounds of interviews and rapport build it would have been perfectly fine for the hiring manager to reply to my email inquiry that I had not been chosen for the position. It would have left me with a better impression of the Institute rather than feeling like I will never apply for a post there again although they obviously find my skills and personality a potential match.   Hiring managers need to understand and respect that candidates also invest a great deal of time and effort into the interview process and while feedback like ""what you can do better"" or ""why we didn't choose you"" isn't obligatory a human touch is for candidates you were seriously considering.",0.97946084,0.020107036,0.00043215236

They sent me an email to pick an inperson interview time slot but it snowed so I then was emailed to choose either a phone or skype interview. I choose the phone interview. Not sure if this was the best idea or not. It seemed like the inperson interview would have had a skill test and they probably would have been more interested in asking me questions.

Interview process was extremely lengthy. 6 weeks after applying online I received an email from hiring manager asking to set up a phone interview.

Thankfully I interviewed via Zoom though the process would have been better handled as a phone screen.

Again this could have easily been circumvented with a phone screener.  Each committee member asked one prepared question three of which I had already responded to in my brief personal introduction.

I applied online and a recruiter (from a different state) emailed me back quickly after I submitted my application. We set up a date and time for a phone interview a few days later. It was a very basic interview just to see my qualifications and talk about more details of the job that they did not list in the description such as salary.

True to her word a week passed and I received an email saying they narrowed down the candidate pool and I did not make it.

I was also thrown off by the amount of questions relating to how I would get along with someone not pulling their weight or hard to get along with (do they have a problem there?) and based on the questions that were asked by the director I  have a suspicion that this school focuses more on numbers and retention than the students best interest at heart. It's a private school so I wasn't too surprised. I ended up not completing my background check as I had already decided that this was not the right fit for me.

I had a total of 4 interviews within a 2 week timeline. First one was over the phone with the recruiter who was very pleasant. The second one was with one of the supervisors over the phone. The next interview was in person and with the other supervisor. They asked the typical questions like walk me through your resume what did you like about your last 2 jobs what did you dislike about them etc. The final interview was with the assistant vp of admissions well the recruiter goofed up on the meeting. I came in the day before it was 'actually' scheduled so that was an inconvenience the recruiter apologized and told me it was actually set up for the next day and she told me the wrong date. So I felt a little discouraged since I had to take time away from my current job. The last interview was pretty similar to the ones with the supervisors except the VP was asking most of the questions. I really connected with all the supervisors I was really bummed when I got an email from the recruiter saying they eliminated the position for another Program Manager and the requisition was closed. I invested a lot of time with them and didn't understand why they put me through such a lengthy interview process if they weren't going to hire anyone else.,0.9850118,0.014749237,0.00023895565

Started with a phone call asking a few basic questions like why did I apply what am I studying etc. Then came in person. To be honest based on the job description I was way under qualified. But I went for it because it was a work study. My boss interviewed me knowing I didn't know jack diddly but what he really wanted was someone with strong customer service skills. Since I had those it was an easy win. In his words it is easy for him to teach tech but hard for to teach someone to be likable person to talk to the staff.  He made me feel at ease unlike some tech interview that grill you.  In the end I would do it again.

It was a 3 week process meeting with the directors and eventually the assistant vp. They asked typical interview questions.It was a little challenging since I do have a bubbly energetic personallity where everyone I talked to was not so it was a little difficult to match their personalities.  After each interview I sent a thank you email and the HR person was always quick to respond to my questions. I eventually made it to the final round of interviews and of course sent my thank you email to the HR person since that was the only contact information I had and then never heard back from them. I even asked when they were looking to make a decision so I would have some kind of knowledge of their time line.

"The recruiter contacted me to conduct the interview. I currently work in customer service so I take phone calls all day. Although I tried to not be on the phone at the time we had scheduled to do the phone interview of course I was on the phone when she called. I called  maybe two minutes after she left a voice mail and her tone with me was irritated that I had to call her back. I apologized and said I would still like to proceed with the interview. Unfortunately I felt rushed and I felt that she had already decided that she didn't want to hire me. At one point I heard her giggling in the background at an answer to the question ""Why did you pick to apply to Rasmussen College?"" She also asked how I heard about the position 3 different times. She had an nasty demeanor and I did not enjoy my time speaking with her. She rushed me off the phone and as soon as I hung up I knew I didn't want anything to do with the company anyway if I was treated that way.

This review is mostly geared toward the experience I had while interviewing for the role of Student Finance Officer. I applied for the job on 4/15/2014 and had the initial face to face interview set up for two weeks later. After this initial interview it took three more weeks for the HR rep (who is located in Minnesota) to set up the next round of interviews. Also she apparently had a hard time understanding the difference between CST and EST. My current job does not offer me a lot of flexibility so when I told her the days and times I was available for the phone interview I expected her to be mostly accommodating. She failed to convert CST to EST (even though I made sure to specify my local time zone in my email) and therefore caused me to have to do the phone interview an hour earlier than what I had told her! I did not complete the second round of interviews until a month AFTER the initial interview.   All throughout the process I was constantly chasing down the HR rep for a status update. She was absolutely horrible about staying in touch. It did not matter what method of communication I chose she would often go a week or two without responding to me unless I called her office repeatedly. While I understand the stresses of the HR environment and the workload that many people are under this is extremely unprofessional and uncalled for. Responding to an email takes literally one minute. She was extremely unprofessional unorganized and even confused me with a different candidate at one point!  Now it has been eight weeks after applying for the position and I am only just now receiving the generic 'Thanks but no thanks' email. This experience left a dreadful taste in my mouth. You should never treat prospective employees this way. I don't care what state the economy is in there is no excuse for utter incompetence and lack of follow through. If this is the type of culture this company perpetuates I want no part in it.  It's a shame that the HR rep was so unprofessional. This experience has motivated me to never apply for a job with this company again.,0.9988506,0.0010015556,0.00014787952
Went throught the proper student workstudy program process. Notified the workstudy program representative and inquired about the position and if I qualified.

There was also a personality assessment that was sent online as well. Once this was complete there was a phone interview with the department director (what would have been my boos). Then in person with department head and director of the campus. I think this is where the issue was with my not being chosen. She was a tough nut to crack it was around 5:30 p.m. and she was clearly ready to get out of there so I felt hurried.

This is where you need to watch out.  Most people will feel as if the interview is over and therefore can say whatever they want to the person giving the tour.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  The person giving the tour will give their impressions of you to the Directors of Admissions so make sure you continue to treat that portion of your visit as you would treat the actual sitdown interview.

"Most degrading interview process I've ever experienced. I formally applied for this job in early May after being in conversation about applying in March. I was told I was being interviewed but every week a new email came saying ""sorry! it's going to happen next week!"".   I was finally interviewed around June 15th and the interview process itself was fine until meeting with HR. I was under the impression that three candidates were interviewing for three positions and I found out via HR (and not from the people interviewing me) that there were actually two positions available. HR also asked me “if I could press you for a concern about this position what would it be?” and after answering I was completely shot down and not even listened to.  After interviewing I was told ""oh you'll hear next week!"" to ""oh you'll hear in two weeks"" until finally ""you will hear via phone this weekend"". Understandably I was stressed out that entire weekend expecting a phone call until the weekend had passed and I still didn't hear. On that Monday I emailed asking for a update only to receive no response. That Tuesday I finally found out via phone at the end of the work day I was not being offered the job. The people interviewing me made it seem pretty clear that I was likely to receive this job offer until I was kept waiting on the hook from March until July only to not get an offer.

"This was probably one of the worst interview experiences I had.  Also this was all in the ""COVID19"" era too  so keep that in mind.   I applied and they were fairly quick to get back with me via email where they scheduled a 30 minute phone screen. That was a pretty typical and easy.   I then moved on to the next round which was 1 hour zoom interview. That also was fairly typical and easy mostly behavioral questions but also some questions about diversity and working styles. A lot of the questions were thought provoking which I appreciated.  I then moved on to the next round which was a 4 hour zoom interview process (Again COVD times).    In between that they offered to do an in person tour of the campus and the department I'd be working in. I was a little hesitant because of COVID but I really wanted the job so I risked it and did the in person tour. That was about 2 hours.  Then came the 4 hour zoom call/interview. That went okay. It was about four 45 minute interviews with different people and one 30 minute interview. You meet with people you'd be working alongside as well as an HR person who went over all their benefits which can be found on their website. Most of the people didn't seem prepared to interview me so I had to ask A LOT of questions most of the time which is fine if not repetitive.   Total time spent with Reed college about about 71/2 hours. I did not get the job and they let me know via email which was a HUGE disappointment. A call would have been nice and way more professional considering all the time I took to interview with them. I asked for feedback and they told me they had zero feedback for me but I should be happy I made it to the final round (not sure what I'll do with that accomplishment?).   Reed claims they do this long winded interview process out of ""tradition"". For one as a candidate there is nothing more stressful as someone who is currently employed than trying to come up with excuses as to why you'll be out of the office so much (71/2 hours basically a full work day). Secondly it was really strange to me that they had me meet with the HR person. Again all their benefit information is online. I'd think anyone applying/interviewing with a company would do research beforehand. This seemed like a giant waste of time for not only the candidate but also the HR department.   In short Reed has a lovely campus with some lovely people. The interview process is not so lovely and the rejection is all but unprofessional.

3 rounds with presentation and a separate call to talk to current staff member about the role. The process was all online and it was fine expect for a few issues. The student panel was mostly white cis people who upheld a layer of “being proper” and not sharing direct information eluding to implicit communication centered around excluding talk that comes for communities of color; i.e. the students expressed themselves in the whitest of mannerism which was pretty disappointing for a school that is suppose to be unique and forward thinking. The whole day had 30 minutes breaks which meant I went form 9am to 7pm and was exhausted. Recommend they review this method as it was exhausting and I burned out near the end. I was asked about my religious affiliation even with the caveat that I ‘didn’t have to answer’ as a potential employee in student affairs there is no ‘you don’t have to’. When I connected with them after about hearing back I was told I would stay connected when another position opened up. I haven’t heard anything and they posted the position a month ago so don’t waste your time believing them.,0.9954332,0.0043906434,0.0001761709
I received a phone interview and one virtual facetoface interview both of which were in a question and answer format. In the second interview a panel of three people took turns asking situationbased questions for about 30 minutes and at the end I was able to ask additional questions about the position.  Both rounds were ultimately fairly similar and neither really provided me a chance to highlight aspects of my application that differentiated me from other candidates since they primarily used situational questions that asked me hypotheticals or examples for how I've handled things in the past.  Additionally Reed did not provide any interview questions in advance which seems like an equity policy this institution should have already implemented. Additionally while Reed has decided prohibit salary negotiation because women and POCs are typically uncomfortable engaging in that process they did not provide any information on how they then pay their employees more equitably to balance out this policy.,0.9919518,0.007909347,0.0001388779

I want to start off by saying I have been through many interview processes in the field of higher education and this was honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  I am somewhat relieved I didn't get an offer because the process really put a bad taste in my mouth.  I submitted my cover letter resume and online application and was emailed a day later to schedule a short phone interview with the search committee chair. The interview was a basic screening of my experience and interest in the role which was quick and easy.  Two weeks later I was invited to an oncampus interview. This was a typical 45minute panel style interview with a few current employees  great no problem. A week went by and I was emailed again and asked to schedule a 30minute phone interview with another person who couldn't be present during my previous oncampus interview. Fine.  Another week later I was invited for another oncampus interview which was scheduled 3 weeks out. This was a halfday interview which is pretty typical in the higher ed field. Usually you are invited to campus to meet with some of the people you'd be working with while in the role. In my previous experience with these I have been invited for lunch coffee or at the very least a campus tour. These interviews are generally twoway in that you are also interviewing the staff and the campus to see if it is a good fit for you. This was not the case at Reed.   Most of my 5 hour halfday interview consisted of sitting in a basement conference room fielding the same behavioral questions over and over again by different campus members and stakeholders. I met with 7 different groups of people there were no scheduled breaks no time to grab a snack or glass of water. 5 hours without a scheduled break is cruel. A few of my interviewers mentioned they were filling in for someone else and hadn’t seen my resume/didn’t know anything about me. 5 hours later I was shaking from hunger and mentally exhausted. I was not shown the office where I might be working or anywhere else on campus. I was told a decision would be made in about a week. There was no real closure to my interview and I was not walked out.   Two weeks of silence went by and I emailed the search committee chair to check in and see if they made a decision or have an update on their timeline. No response. Another week went by and I finally received a generic email letting me know that they had chosen another candidate. I replied promptly with gratitude and to see if they had any feedback about my interview and what qualifications I might have been lacking. No response.   I was very put off by this entire process and the way I was treated both during and after my interviews. Our higher education community is very small and I'm sure our paths will probably cross again so I am very perturbed by this behavior.  Do better Reed.,0.9955171,0.0042989706,0.00018396665

I applied for the position in early August had a 2 hour phone interview with the hiring manager then met with the hiring committee the first week of September 2016. I have not been able to get a hold of anyone about the status of the position despite numerous emails and calls to the hiring manager and also to someone in HR. I finally received a voicemail (with no details about the job or hiring status just a request to call back) two weeks ago returned the call and have not heard anything since. It's now been eight weeks since my inperson interview.  Anyone who goes through such a lengthy hiring process  resume & application plus short essay phone interview with the hiring manager and an inperson interview with a five person hiring committee  deserves to be updated in a timely manner about the status of his/her candidacy. Of course I assumed after a couple of weeks of no responses that I was probably out of the running but would have appreciated a response from Reed.

I wore a nice professional looking sweater slacks and flats which seemed appropriate.  At the inperson interview parking was free and I had to walk less than 10 minutes from my car to the building.  It was easy to find my way around the campus.  I met first individually with the hiring manager and then in a small group of four people. They were all professional but also quite friendly with me and with each other which felt very nice. They took turns asking questions which were fairly standard mostly about my previous experiences in various academic settings.  Nothing was odd tricky or unexpected.

This was one of the most unorganized interviewing processes I have ever been through. A receptionist contacted me to setup the initial interview. It was to be a group interview....She thought. The receptionist was not sure and was not able to answer basic questions (the exact time of the interview who will be the interviewer how many people in the group etc.) This raised red flag number one. Went to the interview the next day. The interviewer failed to introduce herself. It was not until the end of the interview that the interviewer introduced who she was (Campus President) as she forgot. Red flag number two. This was a group interview of a  few people. Questions asked were basic behavioral questions (Tell me about a time...). It lasted less than one hour. I was invited back for a oneonone interview the following week.  The 2nd interview was awkward and a tad on the unethical side. Red flag number three was when I was asked what my spouse did for a living and how much did she make. Pretty sure these are both slightly illegal somehow somewhere. Basic interview questions were asked and this sessions lasted around 45 minutes.   After this second interview I did not followup send a thankyou or continue on with the process. The sheer lack of professionalism ethics and kindness eludes this establishment. You can feel it when you walk in and it stays with you the entire time. Just not the place for me. Good luck should you decide to work there.,0.99854904,0.001303046,0.00014778695
I got my interview through someone that worked for the company but it is easy to get an interview by responding to ads that are run on CareerBuilder. The first interview was with the Director of Career Services who I developed an immediate rapport with as our career history was very similar. The interview lasted about an hour and was mostly conversational which allowed me to say all the things I wanted her to know about me. The next step in the process was to await a call to come in for a Wonderlic Test which I scheduled about a week after the initial interview. I was told I scored very well on the test and was scheduled to meet with the Campus President and the Regional Director of Career Services. They both questioned why I was interested in the position as my work history qualified me for a stronger opportunity. My answers seemed to satisfy both of them and I was told there would be a criminal background check a credit check and reference checks. About 10 or 12 days later the Director of Career Services called to offer the job to me. I liked the people I interviewed with but felt that I was the one leading the interview with all 3 people. Unfortunately I later learned that the criteria to be hired was a pleasant outgoing personality passing the Wonderlic and all the checks into a candidate's background. This was because very few of the potential hires successfully met the criteria.,0.030440498,0.9688872,0.0006723588

Questions were not well thought out. Had multiple parts and really just didn't make much sense. Sometimes I feel like they themselves didn't know what they were asking.

The interview process was fine. I think the disappointment  came about during the Salary negotiation process.

After an initial phone interview I was invited for a daylong inperson interview several weeks later which required travel on my part. The interview sessions went well and I was told they hoped to make a decision within a few weeks. After later following up I was put off twice saying they hoped to get back to me by the end of the week which of course they did not.  Upon following up again I received a form HR rejection within 10 minutes. Clearly there was no intention of letting me know I had not been selected despite two interviews and travel that I had to pay for. There is no reason I shouldn't have received a personalized note letting me know I had not been selected for the position.

HR representative called me for the initial phone interview.  After the morning phone interview I was contacted in the afternoon to make arrangements to come to campus the next week.  I rearranged my schedule to be available for three days to fly out there interview for a full day and fly home.  I had eight short sessions during my interviews.  That was fine.  They filled up any downtime by showing me around campus which usually would be fine but it was a very hot and humid day and of course I was in full suit so I was very uncomfortable.  They told me their timeline was two  three weeks to make a decision.  I didn't receive a response to my followups and haven't heard from them since.

They asked really odd questions that didn’t give them a better understanding of my work ethic or skills. One girl I believe was even trying to hide her laugh from my response. I do not believe all of these people should have a opinion on whether you’re a good fit for the position and should be kept to higher leveled staff.

Very slow.  Heard from them 6 months after applying for position.  Had 2 phone interviews.  Later was interviewed by 12 people in one day (2 interview sessions with 6 people on a panel).  Too many people from across varies areas of the university were involved in the hiring process.  After being hired several different people who participated in the interview process told me things about the other candidates as well as things about my own interview which were inappropriate (e.g. who wanted to hire me who didn't etc.).  Clearly those doing the interviews were not trained on what you can and cannot discuss about candidates before during or after interviews.  It was rather unsettling.,0.9986596,0.0012148321,0.00012557286
Brief to the point informative. They understood I was nervous and were sure to keep me calm. Allowed time for me to ask questions.

"I initially applied for the position and got a generic rejection email about a week later saying the position had been filled. Then shortly after that I got an email from someone in their HR department saying that the candidate had fallen through and they were interested in speaking with me. I almost missed the email because that is highly unusual to send out rejections only to have to rescind them. Nevertheless I spoke with the HR person a few days later and she then said that she would like me to speak to the hiring manager. I interviewed with the hiring manager for about 45 mins about a week later. It was a fine conversation and the interview questions were fairly standard. The hiring manager then said that she would like to move me to the writing assignment round and would send me the prompts by the end of the day. This is where the interview process went sour for me. I was sent the prompts as promised on a Monday afternoon and she requested that I return the completed project by Wednesday. First of all the prompt had a typo in it which was confusing enough that I needed to follow up on it. This put me in an awkward position to have to call out my potential new supervisor. Second the deadline absolutely did not fit with my schedule. I had a full day of meetings the next day and two sick kids at home. I have seen other employers ask candidates to give a 48hour window that aligns with their schedule and I find this to be both considerate and equitable. I sent in my completed assignment by the deadline knowing it wasn't my best work but it was all I could do given the time constraints. I never heard a word back from the hiring manager. Not even a thank you for completing the assignment. After two weeks I received the same generic rejection email I had received in the beginning. The best part... there was a typo in the rejection letter! I found this to be in such poor taste. As a hiring manager you should always connect directly with people who you have brought this far into the interview process. I can handle rejection and I also know that I probably could've done a better writing assignment but receiving a poorly written generic email is a pathetic way to treat candidates. In the Glassdoor reviews someone mentioned ""If you see red flags in the interview process pay attention."" The Glassdoor reviews were so bad from employees I almost didn't move forward in the search and now I wish I hadn't. The one positive thing I will say is that I appreciated how swiftly they moved during the interview stage. You knew by the end of the conversation where you stood.",0.9948565,0.0048876894,0.00025584857
First was reached out to by a recruiter who was assertive and supportive through the interview process. My resume was submitted and an interview scheduled. There was a miscommunication on timing so I was 30 minutes early and had to jump back on when the manager was available which started a bit off on the wrong foot but the hiring manager was very kind and clearly knowledgeable. She asked intense questions as she knows what she’s looking for and was honestly beyond my level of technical knowledge so I didn’t receive a second interview. I reached out two days later to the recruiter and was told I wouldn’t be moving forward.,0.9938267,0.00594233,0.00023096277
Straight forward process  I was contacted by a recruiter within a few days of submitting an application. Completed a 20min call with the recruiter who outlined the position responsibilities and asked me a few questions about my experience. She also outlined the compensation range which seemed relatively low and stated there would be no room for negotiation (not sure if that's true or not). I was then scheduled for a panel interview with four people. Everyone seemed really genuine and down to earth and there weren't any curveball questions. A week after the interview I received an email from the recruiter who said the team thought the interview went really well and asked how I was feeling about the position. I replied letting her know that I too felt it went really well but despite this I ended up receiving a rejection email about two weeks later. That was disappointing but I had gotten the sense in the interview that the team may have felt I was a bit overqualified for the role so that's my best guess as to why it didn't work out. Overall it seemed like a strong team that really valued work/life balance so I would still encourage others to apply!,0.5946823,0.404273,0.0010446991
The recruiter didn't call me at our scheduled time. After reaching out we rescheduled to a different day and I gave them the benefit of the doubt. They then called me on the wrong day.

On the day of the interview I was told that one out of the three people I was scheduled to meet with had called in sick and the interview would need to be rescheduled for later in the week. I was unable to come to Boston for a second time as I was coming from an hour and a half away and the interview was set to take place the week before Christmas but suggested a video interview instead. I was told that someone would get back to me with a response as to whether this was a possibility. A week later I had not heard back and followed up but was informed that the company had continued  interviews and selected another candidate.  I understand that companies often need to hire quickly but would have appreciated the consideration of a response to my offer of a video interview after being told a response would be given.

"Candidates were brought in for a panel after a phone screen where at least 4 different departments were present. After candidates were asked to create a multichannel campaign for the department with a three day turn around timeframe  I was told by a friend in a different department that my 20 page document was the norm as other candidates also submitted equally longwinded ""projects"". I appreciate being given sample tasks and the opportunity to showcase how your skills and approach will mesh with a team but this felt excessive at best and exploitative at worst. After submitting the project I was asked for references a process that took almost 2 weeks to complete and was then sent an automated email from the HR department sharing that after all of that I had not been selected. Admittedly this outcome feels like a bit of a relief after this quite strange process. I'm not sure the department I interviewed with is adequately prepared both in theory and practice to be successful with their goals. I hope I'm proven wrong if only for the sake of my friends who work in different departments.  In a phrase the whole process left a bad taste in my mouth.",0.9947488,0.0050550373,0.00019608779

The interview process went as expected: phone call interview general questions about residence life things of this nature. I actually had a great interview experience over the phone I spoke with their director who was super intelligent and unlike most residence life staff at the top seemingly unweighted down by the weight of the department.  During the oncampus interview things were even better but the person who initially interviewed me was out. Even so the man who interviewed me for the majority of the day was great well educated and very invested in finding a good fit for the department. I was interviewing for a position for someone who had just left last minute. The interviewers both had mentioned this several times and were super nice about it speaking of the their exiting employee in positive ways. The exiting employee had not confirmed her appointment at her new position just yet meaning I could have been very well interviewing for a position that was going to be kept. Still the experience was a positive one.   At the end of the interview the assistant director did the benefits check  the benefits were not great and the salary was subpar for a masters level position. In retrospect I would not have taken the position based on salary; you don't go from 30k without a masters to 29k with a masters....thats just complete nonsense. Especially for the ridiculousness that comes with being in residential affairs. But the opportunities to grow as a professional work with liberal arts students again and also have the chance to be close to home in Mystic would have been enough to dilute the decrease in salary.  Still the environment seemed very nice and the people I spoke to were great in referencing the institution in many positive ways.  The only CON to the entire experience was the reference checking. As is with referencing we put down only the references we want potential employers to speak to. These folks did not follow protocol and instead called my supervisor who was not aware of my search and was not listed as a reference. Several weeks later my supervisor brought up the phone call  a super uncomfortable conversation  and mentioned how RWU noticed she was not listed as a reference but wanted to know her opinion on my leaving. LOVELY! Needless to say I was mortified and also super disappointed that I could have gotten the job if the references I wanted were actually called.   For future reference please only call references listed. It is inappropriate for any employer to do that.,0.0672949,0.9123544,0.020350702

The interview process as it turns out now was bizarre to say the least. The concerned department head called me up first saying that he just loved my qualifications and skill sets and would like me to work for Fulton. The HR called up 20 minutes later and set up an interview at their main office in Lancaster Pa( A distance of around 56 miles from my residence.)

He told me all bout the benefits the company offered and all along I was given the impression that I had the job in my bag .  I was told that I would be informed about the result on Monday of the coming week(4 days after the interview). It however turned out to be a long wait.

Almost everyone who gets an interview is hired as long as you don't make yourself seem unattractive.,0.0052084187,0.9891481,0.005643485
Initial interview was at an academic conference. Teaching load and research expectations were explained clearly. Invited to oncampus interview. Had a research presentation and met with faculty from the hiring department department chairperson and dean of the school. Very cordial and collegial process.

They asked questions and then I answered them. Pretty standard stuff. Not too hard at all. The questions were easy to answer. They weren’t as in depth as I thought they would be so it was simple,0.0007253573,0.9980263,0.00124827
The interview was quick and easy. The manager get back to the candidate within a couple days which good because didn't left candidate clueless for a long time.

I applied over a month ago. I was called into an zoom interview after two weeks which involved a panel of 4. Two out of the four introduced themself as “Hi my name is ________. I prefer the pronouns he she and they.” It was awkward because I didn’t know if I should introduce myself the same way. I didn’t even have a chance to use the pronounce so it seemed out of place. It was a good interview and they asked about my skill set and experience. It took 30 minutes. The promised to let me know in a week and half I sent a thank you email after 5 days. When I had another job offer and 13 days had passed I left a voicemail inquiring if I’d be moving forward or not and got a nice rejection email.,0.038097452,0.9604632,0.0014393275

"Never interviewed but wanted to alert older job seekers that the application asked the following question: ""Are you over 40?"" It was not an optional question.

They called me for interview. They asked 57 basic questions. They were reading interview questions. They weren't prepared for any answers when I asked some questions. Very unorganized interview process. When I received a job offer it didn't presented professional way.,0.99883133,0.0010185805,0.00015008911
My interviewer was easygoing and very pleasant. The whole process felt like an informal conversation rather than an interview. She gave me a few minutes to review the questions she was going to ask and all of them were straightforward like my prior experience and my views on how the class should be conducted. She also asked me to solve some of the problems on the board in order to test whether I knew the material I was going to teach.,0.0052724206,0.42880955,0.56591797
Terrible Interview. The job listing did not mention VOIP. Most of the questions were about VOIP. The job description also did not mention that this position was for a Team Lead. I met with 3 members of the team I would be joining. The hiring manager was not even present for the interview. They had a list of 12 questions that they told me they could not elaborate on and they could only ask those questions.   I was told that the 3 people I met with did not have hiring power and they just send their notes from the interview up to higher ups who would make the decision.   With the amount of Bureaucracy I saw just for this interview I will not be accepting this position if it is even offered to me.,0.9987882,0.0010747911,0.00013702134

Very formal and structured interview with five people around a giant conference table with me at the head. Interviewers couldn't deviate from a script of predetermined questions and I wasn't allowed to ask for clarification. Points were given for ability to answer questions satisfactorily. I would call it an interrogation more than an interview. Interviewers had bland disinterested expressions and monotone voices. I was terrified by the process. I also had to take a computer skills test with no clarification provided. Anyone but an unfeeling automaton would be ruled out of the competition.,0.99839944,0.0014265428,0.00017399361

"Inperson interview first with committee (5 people) then second interview with hiring manager.  Spiel from an affirmative action rep before you go in then each person takes turns asking you a question.  Modeled after job description committee often takes notes while you talk.  Given questions in front of me at table on a piece of paper.  They ask you if you have any questions and then just say ""thank you"" and return to their note/score sheets and you are expected to pickup your things and leave (very unnerving and unfriendly).  Second interview had me do a test on a computer in MS office very basic things writing a memo making a simple table of figures in excel etc.  It did take a while to get a call back and for the whole process to complete.  Offer contingent upon background check coming back clean. I know now that not all AA interviews require the test but if they do they may not tell you beforehand.",0.99772125,0.0021253978,0.0001532616

"5 Questions as I recall posed by different members of a committee usually without a hiring manger present although depends on the work area and manager.   The questions are to tie into the job descriptions and be scored sole on the responses and material submitted with the application.  Weighting is to be given for the areas significance to job success.  The organization typically has extensive ""primary areas"" I don't think anyone ever told them major areas should represent 20% of the timeso they will have 15.  Make sure you use a CV (more detail and length) versus a resume (short and sweet) format getting volume can matter more.  Being on staff does not mean they know what you can do and they have to have it in the file for compliance reasons.  Most areas hire based on disclosed criteria.  I have heard that  some of managers will have a predetermined preference which the committee may not even know.",0.8863033,0.11331202,0.00038471178
The interview process was long and interviewers seemed cold and unwelcoming. After a month I recieved a response to move onto the first portion of the interview an online assestmemt. Two weeks after completing the assessment I moved onto the next round in the process which was a virtual interview scheduled a week out from their initial response. I recieved some worksheets on how to prepare for the interview and example responses but this did not prepare me for how cold the interviewers would be. I was notified that a panel of 6 individuals would be interviewing me and was only interviewed by 2 which wasn't bad. But upon starting the interview the staff gave me the feeling that they needed to interview me for the sake of the process and was already not considering me. They were cold with introductions and most of the time were not looking at the screen when I was speaking to them. SMC discusses and promotes a nonbiased interview process but the removal of all energy and emotion from the interview made me feel unwelcomed and very distant from my interviewers. The interview was a total of 30 minutes on zoom I was put on a list of Administrative Assistants to be moved onto the next round but will not be moving forward with the company as this was one of the most uncomfortable interviews I have had.,0.9976966,0.0021439448,0.00015947051
Extremely offensive and elitist interview experience. Would not recommend if you want to work with an open minded team who is professional inviting and supportive. I really wanted to write a good review of this office but after speaking with numerous Higher Ed professionals about my experience who all agreed it was pretty unprofessional I had to keep it real here. Hopefully they have changed some of their practices and team dynamics since this interview but if you get a bad feeling when you interview trust it.,0.98745173,0.012282795,0.00026548366

The interview was an exam! They asked me questions in my major. So this is exam NOT an interview. They put lecturers with masters degree in the committee to ask someone with a Ph.D!,0.99562365,0.0042106286,0.00016565621
Far too intensive/timeconsuming for a technician position! The first step is a written exam offered on a single set date (Saturday). Took the morning to complete. The exam was simple enough and as expected from the job title. Then an oral exam is conducted several weeks later. This again is on a set date (weekday) without flexibility and not leaving any room for input from you or your questions. The final step on your end is an ACTUAL interview (YAY!) that lasts less than 20 minutes and is not at all about getting to know you or your skills rather yet another set of questions very similar to those in the oral exam.  Again there is no time/room for input from you which is a clear indication to me that they are not looking for a longterm employee who would really excel there. I would estimate at least 8 people (8!!) made it to the actual interview for a single open position. Overall I was displeased with the process and the apparent lack of interest by the interviewers. I would not recommend this process unless you are out of work and have a LOT of time to devote to a convoluted process that is stacked against you. The interview itself was pretty easy and typical of any random position however the process itself was far too complex for a position like a lab tech.,0.99890006,0.00092713285,0.0001727746

The traditional route to getting hired is long and lengthy.  I got the job in a rather more informal way because I was hired first as part of workstudy.  That interview was made up of completing an exam to assess your mathematical skills.  Once you pass that then you moved on to talk to the mathlab coordinator and she told me when I could start.   If you are going directly through the SMC website then you submit your application.  Then you receive an email in which you are assigned a date to complete an exam which consists of various math topics ranging from arithmetic  calculus.  If you pass that first phase then you continue on to the second phase which is front of a panel.  They ask you various technical questions and your method of solving such questions.

I had been working as a part time lecturer at Santa Monica for 7 years before the interview.  All applications had to be through the online system.  A number of people were chosen for a panel interview all on the same day.  The question and answer process was very structured.  They gave me the questions 30 minutes beforehand as they were interviewing someone else. There were 7 people in the panel.  Each person read one question and then listened to my answer.  There was very little interchange during the process.  I found it difficult to deal with such a nonresponsive process.  The whole seemed to be geared towards treating each applicant exactly the same.

"I participated in two interviews for this position.  The first interview was with the team leader.  The second interview was with the department team.  I had expressed working with the department for which I interviewed over the course of approximately 11/2 years.  I spent a total of approximately 11/2 hours interviewing and perceived that my joining the team would be mutually beneficial that there seemed to be a culture fit in terms of personality and existing skills sets—and that I could add value.  About one month passed between the second interview and the beginning of the March COVID pandemic declaration.  After several attempts to followup on my application I did eventually hear back approximately six months later from the team leader.  They apologized for the drop in communication and explained the extenuating personal and business reasons behind it which I appreciated.    They inferred that the position for which I interviewed was no longer available.  I would not be surprised if an internal candidate was selected for this position (this happens in highered institutions frequently).  It is also possible that the budget originally allocated to the job for which I was interviewing got reallocated to create a new role to mitigate potential pressure from students whom might be concerned with the current ""political"" and / or ""social justice"" climate in our country.   Private corporations and educational institutions ""fear"" getting ""cancelled"" by their customers and matriculating students and so hiring teams feel obligated to make certain decisions and adapt in extenuating circumstances where personal or global health emergencies—and ""political pressures""—may be variables.  Of course it's also possible that they felt I simply wasn't the correct person for the job.  ✔︎ That said the expectation that a representative from the school's human resources department should have been enlisted to update me in a timely fashion regarding the status of my application is reasonable.  ✔︎ I take no issue with not being offered this job or with the team that interviewed me.  ✔︎ However I would like to see seamless communication plans inplace for the future because my time has value and also because I am familiar with the culture of this school and know they are capable of doing better.  __  Disclaimer  Please note that this review is based on my own personal experience and perception and is protected by free speech laws within the jurisdiction of The United States Of America.

"I am not superstitious you might be interested to know that I interviewed at 4:00 pm on a rainy Friday the 13th.  The interview lasted about an hour and twenty minutes. The first half of the interview was an orientation session although there was no offer or acceptance of the position beforehand. After complaining about having to prepare for a major holiday celebration that evening Dr. Maryhelen Hendricks  alternately read from a three or fourpage singlespaced course description paraphrased the job requirements and spoke in commands. Many of her sentences began with ""You will..."" . This had a smothering effect. She answered some of my questions during this monologue; most of the others for the reasons stated below became moot. The second half of the interview was a more typical questionandanswer session. It went well for awhile. Then she became increasingly confrontational. It began with her raising a routine manner: a background check. She said ""If you've ever been in jail you'd better tell me right now so we can say goodbye."" I nonverbally indicated I had no criminal record. When I said there were several factors for me to consider regarding the position including that I would have to reduce my hours at my current position to teach a class at SVA she shot back ""You could have had all three!"" When I replied that this had not been clear to me she became visibly angry. When I requested a day or two to consider her offer which was never explicitly made Dr. Hendricks suggested that I should have interviewed earlier because she was leaving town next week. She then demanded that I ""decide here and now."" I declined to do so and the interview ended. It was clear from one of her emails that she was under pressure to fill the position but there was no indication that this was a takeitorleaveitonthespot proposition. I suspect that she wanted me very badly and therefore engaged in arm twisting to get me on board. Hectoring is a nonstarter for me. If it appears in an interview more of the same and worse is likely to occur on the job. That said if you're willing to put up with that sort of behavior SVA might be a good fit for you. If you're not it isn't. The hourly rate is high$89but like most college adjunct positions it is a lot of work as the materials presented to me indicated. Dr. Hendricks said that a writing coach and other support staff are available to assist teachers with curriculum development and that people rarely leave.

Another factor of my irritation was the ABYSMAL salary that was quoted to me: if I accepted the offer I'd only be paid pebbles for the extensive list duties outlined in the description.

"The interview consisted of three rounds.  The first  was an interview with the full search committee that lasted about an hour.  The second was a 'fit' interview with an HR representative  The third had three components. I met with the team I would be joining made a presentation of recommendations to a faculty member and met with the search committee again. I was given the details of the presentation a few days ahead of time.  My only negative experience was in the 'fit' interview. As a Christian school they want to know if you are a Christian and if you broadly agree with their beliefs. My issue was that all but one of those beliefs was disclosed on their website ahead of time. Their ""Statement Regarding Human Sexuality"" is not advertised online. As such one cannot determine before this 'fit' interview whether or not they agree with the statement.  As one might fear the statement makes claims about sex gender and sexual orientation that many people including some Christians disagree with. The HR representative made it clear that I did not have to personally affirm this statement but that one needed to be comfortable being a part of an institution that held this belief.  Fortunately I turned the job down so I did not have to make a decision about whether or not to live with this.

Interview Process: I discovered the position on CL and applied online.  This was followed by a phone interview an in person with the hiring manager and one of their peers an interview with the positions team peers an interview with HR and finally an interview with department directors.  After that I received an offer letter in timely manner.  All in all about 2 weeks worth of time based on scheduling. Process was conducted professionally.  Based on how they interviewed me It is understandable why they were among the only 3 universities in WA to be ranked in the 2017 <major college reviewer> best national universities list.  Environment: First of all it is a private religious college.  Expect to get questioned about your religious belief.  That being said the university has an open and inclusive policy.  During the interview process I never felt judged.  In fact I was surprised that during the HR interview process the main subject was about not discriminating nor judging others choices.   Second a benefit that I felt during the application process was that this was a mission driven institution with preparation of students for a productive positively impact life was the priority.   During the interview process the majority of people I met seemed open interested in me and easy to communicate with.  I felt they loved where they worked and made me want to work there too. The position itself had a diverse set of technology to support as well as immediate growth plans for new technology with stated ability to contribute to current and future solutions.  This would have been a great position to learn and bolster my career.  Reason for declining offer: A review of salaries from GlassDoor indicates a 15% drop in salary compared to corporate salaries in the King County WA area.  I mention this because anybody comparing will notice this fact.  I recognized it at the beginning but fully believe that the benefits offered by SPU did more than just offset the salary difference.  Both personal benefits such as contributing to a world improving organization as well as benefits such as vacation holidays ...   Unfortunately after reviewing the position I could not take it due to commute distance and time impact on family.  If lived closer I would be working there now.  Why the long review? I wanted to work there.  It looked like a great team as well as a great employer.  SPU was the best interview process out of 25 jobs applied for which generated 8 in person interviews.

I applied online and after about two weeks I heard back from the hiring manager. Then I had a phone screening with several very easy and simple IT questions.  After that process I went to the campus to have an in person interview with two gentlemen (Doug and Jon). This was a really nice conversation but very basic for an interview process. The usual things were discussed (past experience skills and how I treat customers in some situations)After this there was a breif moment where I was asked to wait outside then I was brought back into the office and told I would be moving on to the HR interview. A couple days later a lady from HR called to do a interview to talk about my walk with Christ and my story with Christianity. (SPU is a Christian university) After this I was called to do a director level interview and this was done in front of a panel of 5 directors of the entire IT department. The whole process spanned several weeks but only took up about 5 total hours of my time.

The HR rep and I reviewed SPU's policies which are quite conservative for me. They have a statement on human sexuality which describes at length their views on marriage and sex (being only between men and women). I questioned further and found out that they do not hire people who identify in the LGBTQ community because they physically can't abide by the human sexuality statement.

The process was pretty standard until the HR interview. They make you acknowledge that you are ok with their stance on human sexuality. Basically it states that God only made man and woman (no inbetween) and that marriage is only between men and women. They also basically make sure you know that they don't hire people who identify as LGBTQ.  I got an offer right after I completed the HR interview but after reflection realized there was no way I could work at an organization with those ideals. Plus the salary was on the low end and vacation benefits were minimal. I turned them down.,0.99795496,0.001886828,0.00015817722

I had applied via online. Along with your professional experience Pacific University will require intimate details on your spiritual life prior to your interview. They will also require you to agree and sign some sort of lifestyle code.  I thought it was strange but it did not chafe with my values.  There was a phone screening and a week later there was an onsite interview. The onsite interview consisted of a test with various mathematical hypothetical and professional problems. Most of them were fairly easy and was only really used to show your thought process. The remaining time was spent in conversation with professional experience emphasized.  I was told my candidacy was to be pursued at the conclusion of the interview. However after a brief discussion of my faith I was told since I was not a Christian I would not get the position. It seems like a weird place to work if they are screening for only Christians ( which I told them prior I was not nor was it listed for obvious reasons that you would not get hired if you are not a Christian. ). It is discrimination and illegal.   I have no doubt it is a nice place to work so long as you tow the line.,0.43087408,0.5669209,0.0022050692
"Started off with a phone interview Interview went well and was asked to come to an in person interview. This is where it gets a little odd. As soon as I arrive I am asked to take a written test which is fine except for the fact that over half of the questions were not related to the position at all. For example lots of logic questions like this:   A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures each containing an identical light bulb or light globe. Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched off at present. You are outside the room and the door is closed. You have one and only one opportunity to flip any of the external switches. After this you can go into the room and look at the lights but you may not touch the switches again. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?  Anyways after going through that I had yet another phone interview with the HR department asking me about my religious preferences and to explain their christian lifestyle (kind of odd but no big deal).   After this I was administered an online test since I didn't answer any of the logic questions on the first test and was told that not answering these would disqualify me. This test was a little more.... Interesting. The first part was a personality test consisting of around 50 questions followed by a 6 minute ""cognitive"" test consisting of something like 20 questions. These are pretty hard and again did not relate to the position at all.   All in all it was a very strange interview process I will say that the person I interviewed with (both Eric and the HR lady) were both extremely nice and seemed like they would have been a pleasure to work with so there was that.",0.6732334,0.32594875,0.0008178378

"Horrible experience. HORRIBLE!!! The job I went to interview for was not the job they were actually interviewing FOR. How stupid is that right???  I was told to show up at a certain time for the interview. When I got there some gal took me into this little room that was absolutely freezing and told me to take a seat. I was given the job description of the position I had applied for and told to read through it and sign the bottom of the third sheet. Fine. No biggie. I read through it and it looked pretty straightforward and I signed it. The gal took my signed job description and said to ""wait right here and your interview will be in a few minutes""  HAH!!!  Almost ONE HOUR LATER I was still waiting. I was just about ready to leave (since I had waited so long without seeing another living soul and I was so cold that I couldn't hardly stand it) when the same gal FINALLY appeared and ushered me into a room filled with people. The entire department seemed to be sitting around the long table and they had snacks and sodas and such and all appeared to be having a great time at the interviewees expense I might add. It's always more fun to be the interviewer than the interviewee that's for sure. For them it was party time   for me I could just tell it was going to be a waste of time. Something about that entire group just didn't sit well with me. Anyway they sat me at the head of a long table and started firing question after question for about an hour. I was even interviewed by the department IT guy (WTH!!!) who was analyzing me on my Excel skills via 100 million questions. That guy was such a jerk. I had already made up my mind that I wasn't going to take the job even if it was offered to me because everyone was just so rude. It was like talking to an entire room of people who had already decided they weren't going to like anyone. Anywhoo  the big problem for me was when they handed me the 3 page job description that I had signed. Someone had taken that job description for the job I had originally applied for and had crossed out almost all of the job duties in red ink. I was told the job now had different duties and I was instructed to look down at the bottom of the page to see the ""new job""  between the time I signed it and the actual interview someone had written all the new job duties at the bottom of the page. WHAT???? Like how does that work????   I would have never applied for the ""new job"" as it was not something I was the least bit interested in. When I questioned why I had been told to read the job description and sign it the entire group acted like I was completely out of line in asking this question. At that point I literally had utterly and completely made up my mind that there was no way in H.E.L.L. that I was taking the job even if it was handed to me on a silver platter. It was without a doubt the worst interview I have ever been on and it was a: Complete.Waste.Of.Time.  My advice to anyone interviewing at Seminole State College  make sure the job you are interviewing for is the one you ACTUALLY applied for. I have been told by other people that they love to do the old ""bait and switch"" tactic. Long story short I went on to work for the University of Central Florida  and it not only has a much better reputation for worker satisfaction but they are straight up with the fact that what you apply for is what you get!!!!",0.9819303,0.01755204,0.00051756226

"I applied online with a cover letter and was quickly ushered into a phone interview.  Upon undertaking the phone interview with Keith in the I.T. Department he scheduled me for an inperson interview at the start of the next week.  That interview was held in Corrigan Hall with Keith and Eric.  The interviews themselves went well; there were no specific technical questions and mostly they centered around discussions of past experience skills and how I've handled similar events/incidents.  I found the interviewers to be cynical and negative often mentioning the difficulty they have progressing security initiatives policies and projects in the Academic environment or with the type of staff and faculty they work with; in essence the politics of the place (which is conceivably better to know about prior to accepting a position).   Upon completion of the inperson interview as we were shaking hands I was informed that I was one of two candidates for consideration who in the interviewers' words ""actually knew what he was talking about"" in the realm of Cybersecurity.  I was further informed that I would get a response either that day (Monday) or the next day (Tuesday) at the latest.  On Wednesday I sent both interviewers a ""thank you"" email.  I received no reply to that email and no feedback was given about the hiring progress.  A week later (the next Monday) I sent a followup email politely requesting feedback.  I went back to the Seton Hall application website and was able to log into an account and check the status of my application which stated ""under review.""  I did not receive any reply to my second email either.  Over 2 weeks later without any replies or updates I called the I.T. Services Helpdesk and left a message on Keith's voicemail.  I left a polite message with my name and contact information stated I had not received any replies and inquired about the progress of their hiring process.  I received no reply via email or phone however upon checking the status of my application on Seton Hall's website again my status was changed to ""not selected"" by the close of the same day that I called.  My experience above is indicative of an uncommunicative inconsiderate and unprofessional environment.  Over two weeks of complete silence despite polite inquiries gratitude and offers to furnish any additional needed information were a large red flag for me that likely would have resulted in my declining an offer if it were made at this point.  I have had positive experiences with other organizations where I did not receive an offer(Hubspot comes to mind) but I have never encountered this level of lack of consideration for the candidate.  The position over two weeks after my inperson interview is still posted both on Glassdoor and the Seton Hall website.

Applied for position and was interviewed a few weeks later. I was highly qualified for the position but looking back I realize it probably wouldn't be a good fit. During the interview I realized I had more experience in the field than one of the managers. Siena seems like a good place to work but they need to improve their hiring process. When asked to come for an interview I wasn't informed that I was going to meet with the whole office team (as a group interview). I felt comfortable meeting with them even though it was a bit surprising. I wish Siena the best as they compete in the highereducation marketplace!,0.049293473,0.948862,0.0018445593

The last interview the main hiring manager described the job differently than what was posted and the other members of interview questioning described different qualities they were looking for not mentioned by the hiring manager the job description or anyone on the team. They were repeatedly validating what I had to share which was a shock when I asked for feedback and haven’t heard anything back to work at Simmons or another school.

Although there was one person in the interview who kept giving me weird glaring looks that made me very uncomfortable. It was a bit of a long day but this is not uncommon for the 5 Colleges. Never heard anything back at all until over a month later received a generic rejection email. Wasn't even personalized with my name or from the person I had been in contact with.

It was alright. Low pressure really This question seems simple so many people fail to prepare for it but it's crucial. Here's the deal: Don't give your complete employment (or personal) history. Instead give a pitch—one that’s concise and compelling and that shows exactly why you’re the right fit for the job.

The host who took me from one faculty's office to another was having certain bias towards their own female faculties as while talking about them he clearly indicated that how he wished that the whole campus should have been white male only faculties though to comply with diversity policy they have to have females and also faculty of color. I was shocked. I am white and male so I certainly would be welcome here though I have worked with so many African Americans Asians and females and I would like to bring some of them as collaboration and this goes against my own personal values. The interim head of department was totally clueless on what the department's goal is and told me that they are actively searching a new head that by policy has to be an external candidate and once head is finalized he will be able to answer this question for me.

Several phone call interviews with different professors were used as interviews along with several email questions. The interviewer (usually different professors in charge of different research projects) asked several questions regarding interest in their specific project and how your skills might bring a new element to the table.

I interviewed with an indeed virtual hiring day. Interview lasted maybe 5 minutes. I was not told anything about the job only that I’ll get an email to move on to the next steps. Felt very unprofessional and was told straight up that there were several candidates and only a few spots. Gave me the feeling of a very competitive work space. Didn’t feel like a personal experience at all I can see why this university has such bad reviews… asked me only two or three questions and didn’t provide any details what so ever about the company.,0.9987446,0.0011098834,0.00014552727

I applied online and a coordinator reached out to schedule the interview. She only gave me one day with three afternoon options. That should've been a red flag but I told her I was available whenever and she told a time for me. I interviewed with a manager in the talent acquisition department. I feel like she didn't like me and just went through the motions for the interview. I already knew I didn't get it after the call and got the standard rejection email about two weeks later. I could tell she didn't read my resume because she was asking me questions that were on there already. She asked me why I was leaving my company when my resume in bold said laid off next to the company's name. I dodged a bullet with this company.,0.9980088,0.0018601938,0.00013093778

A series of three interviews. A phone interview sparklier video recording and a zoom meeting with three individuals from the department. All very nice and sincere. I didn't feel that they had the expertise to grow the program like their vision and because of that I wasn't the right fit for the role despite being offered an in person visit with the offer to pay for travel expenses (flight) to take a tour and meet them in person. They asked simple questions about how I could grow the program during Covid.I was off put by the dean who hardly spoke despite having a 1:1 meeting for thirty minutes. That was alarming as it seemed he was so far removed from the team that he had such little input direction or vision.

"I applied online through an internal recruiter. He contacted me first via email to discuss relocation possibilities since I am not a local candidate then conducted a phone interview.  The phone interview went really well and he moved me on to a 1:1 video interview with a higher up.  Prior to the video interview the recruiter said ""you're going to make me look like a rock star"".  Next was the first video interview that went very well. Lasted about 90 minutes and I got the impression that I was the only candidate at that time. I was then contacted for a second video interview with the COO. This one didn't seem to go as well. The video cut out about halfway through and we conducted the rest by phone so it was a harder to read his body language after that.  He was pretty vague and seemed uncomfortable answering any of my questions [remember an interview is a 2way street ESPECIALLY if I'm going to relocate]. I think I may have offended him when I asked about the reputation of management (read employee reviews on Glassdoor  seems there's some unprofessional behavior going on with the President and other members of management).

"The interview process was standard up until a certain point. There was a screening followed by a ""Round 1"" of interviews in which smart team members asked thoughtful interview questions.  I really liked the idea of calling these people teammates. Thanks to their great interview style  I'll call this a neutral (ie not negative) overall experience.  Round 2 never happened. A clear rejection wasn't given (which I know happens sometimes) but rather the CTO offered vague ""Let's be in touch...things are really busy right now."" mixed messages with ambiguous signals.  I'd honestly rather they ghosted me than leave me hanging with such confusion. Say no or say nothing. They maybe followed by radio silence left me baffled.

This was the strangest interview I've ever had. I was a little underqualified for the job as I was about to graduate from college. The interviewer opened by noting that I'd applied to many positions at TED as if that were a problem. I'd only applied to 2 other roles but he said I'd applied to 6. He then proceeded to ask me why I would apply for this job when I wasn't qualified and asked what made me think I was qualified. It was all very pleasant but I was confused about why he connected with me in the first place. He said he would consider me for other open roles to which I had applied. I never heard from him again.,0.017890172,0.9816327,0.0004770343

TED's interview process is the most unprofessional interview process I have ever been through.   1. Started interviewing in an untimely matter  Did not take into account time managing their own events that would delay the interview process 2. Emails flew into my inbox at bizarre hours such as 1am 3. Asked for interview availabilities the night before a proposed interview time 4. Disregarded my interview time availabilities and proposed different times without reason 5. Forgot to schedule an interview with a TED employee which left me waiting around my phone 6. Confirmed interviews the day of or at a late time the night before 7. Opened emails many times without responding timely (I tracked them) 8. After personalized emails with my main contact for the position  a generic rejection flew into my inbox. After kindly asking for feedback on my performance for future job search I haven't received anything.   Overall the interviews themselves were very easy but the process was extremely rushed and for no good reason. You would think after so much effort (6 interviews) that they would really be interested. I think the messy interview process is a great foreshadowing of how the organization actually runs. I'm glad I don't work there. Apply for TED if you want to waste your time on the job hunt.,0.9987729,0.0010517782,0.00017520184

The people who I would be primarily surrounded with would act like I didn't exist. He advised me that there were really nice people who worked there but that the perception of the cleaning crew would be invisibility.

A few calls with a recruiter. Phone screen then followed up with a call to organize a google meet meeting (video call) with the hiring manager  HR Manager and another HRBP. The interviewers were intense. They seemed very passionate about their jobs but the interview and conversations I had with the recruiter were very different and did not match the original job description. The recruiter explained that they were making changes to the job and listed qualities they were looking for but when I mentioned that to the interview team they seemed puzzled. The recruiter made it sound like they were looking for someone with extensive excel and reporting experience yet the interview team wanted someone with a lot of coaching experience. Over all it seemed like a waste of time and a lot of confusion for me.,0.9912606,0.008527643,0.00021172011

Applicant beware. This organization will ghost you with no explanation.  I applied for this role and was interviewed by a panel of individuals. I was then asked to produce a 60 second video on a topic of my choice.  I produced the video and then only heard from TSTC once more. I sent multiple emails asking for an update and a month later I finally received the one and only response from one of the hiring managers telling me that the process was lengthy and I would eventually get an update from HR.  I never heard from them again even with multiple emails asking for an update on the position.  This is completely unprofessional and is indicative of the company culture.

The interview process was very informal but brilliantly designed. My supervisor introduced herself and another member of CAPS and gave me a tour of the T. Boone Pickens campus introducing me to other staff members along the way. I got the sense she was watching my interpersonal style as I introduced myself to other staff and made use of the brief amount of time we had together. At the end the three of us sat together and we had an informal conversation. It was a very human and authentic encounter.,0.0019444627,0.4785189,0.5195366
My interview was fairly informal. I was asked if I had any experience working with certain equipment and the like and I simply corroborated what I said from my resume. It was more of a tour of the work environment and a description of the kind of work I would be doing rather than a series of interview questions. However the process was still useful to the interviewer because she was examining my professionalism conduct and demeanor.,0.00044448976,0.9983364,0.0012191733

3 parts  1) phone 2) Skype 3) in person  with small panel then huge openended presentation of your choice for collegewide attendees and satellite campuses.  Each stage included multiple people on the university side.  The Skype interview was interesting in that I did feel as if I was sitting at the end of a long table looking at the entire panel.  In step 3 there was individual time spent with the CTO then meetings with 2 peer directors before being led to a room where I presented twice for 45 minutes each.  After the presentation one of the directors took me on a 2 hour tour of the campus so I could visualize the facilities and speak to people in person that would report to the position.    While the 8th floor of the tower is the location of the Technology Dept leaders offices including CISO CTO and Directors the mood was very sterile dry too quiet.  Only about 3040 minutes was builtinto the day to spend with the CTO. This was concerning since the CISO role would report directly to the CTO.,0.0015164939,0.99155456,0.006928935

"First there was a phone screening. The person performing the screening told me the interview process would be as follows: finish the rest of the phone screenings; conduct phone interviews for the best candidates from the phone screenings; invite the strongest phone interview contenders onto campus for the first round of interviews; then have a second round of interviews based on the first round of on campus interviews; and finally provide an offer. Apparently I did so well during the screening I was asked to come in for an interview. I was flattered.  However it snowed the day before my interview. The University had a 2 hour delayed opening. I was in constant email contact with one of the two interviewers letting her know I was going to be there when the university opened if it didn't disrupt the interviewers schedule. She assured me everything was fine and to be at the university when it opened.  When I arrived at the interview I was greeted by the phone screener and the second interviewer. She told me that the other interviewer could not make it because the public schools were closed and he needed to stay home and take care of his child.  She and I continued the interview with most of the same questions she asked on the phone being asked again facetoface. The only other different interview question asked is given below. Whether I answered it properly or not (to her subjective liking) is another question. I'm assuming not since she told me she'd call me ""In a couple of days"" to reschedule the interview to include the other interviewer but she never did.  She never even called to say the position was given to someone else. I called after 2 weeks wondering what happened (as I am from academia. This is the first time applying for staff positions. As a professor I always received an email phone call letter something that told me what was next). That's when she told me they offered the job to someone else and if that person doesn't accept then she'll contact me. Pretty rude in my book.",0.73391443,0.2653601,0.0007254397

Each person had thoroughly read my resume and cover letter and posed relevant questions.  Following the interview all of my references were checked and then I was offered the job about 710 days later.  HR called with the job offer and salary offer (not the director/manager) which was unusual. HR was totally unwilling to negotiate on salary or benefit package at all. Experience with HR was negative.  The entire process took about 2 months.,0.9966577,0.003024726,0.00031762128

I then waited until Tuesday and called to leave a message with the DOA to follow up; that call wasn’t returned. Next day then emailed her and still haven’t heard back.

Was asked to repeat the interview process and completed the 4 hour process for a second time. Was told the timeline to choose a candidate was a month. Did not hear for two months and was sent a standard email from the school informing me that they would not be moving forward.

I am writing this job review to share my experience working as a custodian at XYZ Corporation. Having worked in this role for the past year I can confidently say that being a custodian has been a fulfilling and rewarding experience overall. First and foremost one of the highlights of this position is the sense of pride that comes from maintaining a clean and safe environment for both employees and visitors. As a custodian I played a crucial role in ensuring that the premises were clean wellorganized and free from hazards. It was satisfying to see how my efforts contributed to creating a pleasant atmosphere and enhancing everyone's experience within the company. Moreover working as a custodian provided me with an excellent opportunity to develop and demonstrate my organizational and time management skills. With multiple tasks to handle such as cleaning restocking supplies and responding to maintenance requests I had to prioritize effectively to meet deadlines and fulfill the company's expectations. This experience has significantly improved my ability to manage my workload efficiently. Another aspect of being a custodian that I appreciate is the variety in daily tasks. While the core responsibilities revolve around cleaning and maintenance I often encountered different situations that required problemsolving and adaptability. From handling spills and unexpected messes to adjusting cleaning routines based on events and activities each day brought a new challenge. This aspect kept the job interesting and prevented monotony from setting in. I must also mention the positive work environment and the supportive team that I had the pleasure of being a part of. The custodial staff at XYZ Corporation was always willing to lend a helping hand and share knowledge and expertise. It created a collaborative atmosphere where I felt comfortable asking for assistance or guidance whenever needed. The camaraderie among the team members made the work more enjoyable and contributed to a positive overall experience. However like any job there were a few challenges that came with being a custodian. The physical demands of the role can be strenuous at times as it involves standing for long periods lifting heavy objects and performing repetitive tasks. While this aspect of the job could be tiring it also provided opportunities for physical exercise and keeping fit. Additionally the custodial role often required flexibility in working hours including evening shifts weekends and occasionally being on call. While this flexibility might not suit everyone's lifestyle I found it manageable and appreciated the chance to have a more varied schedule. In conclusion my experience as a custodian at XYZ Corporation has been highly rewarding. It has allowed me to contribute to the wellbeing of the company and its employees develop valuable skills and work in a supportive team environment. Despite the physical demands and occasional schedule adjustments I have found this role to be fulfilling and satisfying. I would recommend it to individuals who value cleanliness organization and take pride in their work. I hope this job review provides valuable insights into the custodial position at XYZ Corporation.

Initial Interview was a roundtable type of interview with at least 6 people present from different articles.  Each interviewer had the opportunity to ask at least one question and then get an answer for the candidate.  There was no formal format to who asked the next questions but they did give the candidate an fair amount of time to answer the questions.  After it was over candidate was advised that they would hear from the board if they were going to proceed further.  Never heard from the board and it was at least 45 months before receiving an email that would not be proceeding further in the process.,0.8850189,0.114700176,0.00028094952

Initial brief phone interview (more of a screening) with position's immediate supervisor.

I applied and finally heard back 6 months after my application was submitted. Phone interviewed with search committee composed of current faculty. That was great. I could tell they were going to be a great team of colleagues. Was invited to campus interview. Met with department chair (clueless) associate dean (nice) vice chancellor (condescending) chancellor (nice) and interim dean (rushed). Offer was made pretty quickly after the campus interview (turns out that if you are brought in you pretty much have the job unless one of the above doesn't like you for some reason). The quick offer at that point was probably because the fall semester was starting very soon so they needed to fill the position immediately.,0.0034203187,0.22630233,0.7702774

I was contacted to interview for a position that I had applied for about 3 weeks prior.  The interview was a three person panel interview.  Typical interview questions (describe yourself strengths weaknesses).  The only negative from the interview was that there were several times that we had to pause so others could explain answers to one of the panel members (now my supervisor).  The panel member has worked for the University for 5 years but was so unfamiliar with the University that they did not understand the conversations/follow up questions that resulted from my answers.,0.99663913,0.003239397,0.00012144403

To transfer from one division to another the interview process was simple involving a panel by phone. All movement across divisional boundaries requires a background check as well these days. When I had first interviewed as an outsider I first submitted my CV and college transcripts then gave a presentation to the faculty (conferencestyled). I gave another presentation to administrative leadership in Troy and then I waited for the acceptance letter. There is a lot of informality to the process with TROY and most people in the decisionmaking chain like to talk casually about various topics. Building trust this way is therefore very important.

"I applied on indeed and got a call the next day for an interview. I was under the impression that I would be the only one coming in for an interview but there were several people getting interviewed for the same position.  After waiting until everyone showed up all of us were sent into a computer room and asked to sit down. There we met Robert Pope the ""Campus President"" he stated out of all of the people who were in the room there were only 3 open positions. He described the position which is pretty much a sales job and asked all of us to fill out scenariobased questions.  The whole process seemed to sketch and unsettling. As people turned in their papers we were called in one at a time for a one on one interview. However this was a panel interview with two female Admission Reps. The energy they gave off was fake and the interview was rushed. Since this a forprofit school that is not nationally accredited or regionally accredited I was not surprised I did not hear anything after the first interview. If you have integrity and you don't want to scam young vulnerable people into taking out loans then find something else. All this position is doing is selling the school and loans to naive broke people. DO NOT WORK HERE and DO NOT GO HERE. The money may sound good but tell people you know that if you are a California resident you can go to community colleges for free if you apply for financial aid which will grant CA residents the BOGWaiver.  Yes 2 year and 4year colleges take more time but it is better than this place. Community colleges and UC and Cal states are accredited colleges and will transfer to 98% of colleges. Grants and scholarships are easier and almost guaranteed if you choose to go to a CC Cal state or UC. Again don't work here.

I applied via indeed. I received a call promptly the next day from the Director. I met with him 5 days later. When I arrived I filled out a paper application and a few questions and then waited for about 20 mins. I was interviewed directly with the Director. He was extremely nice and attentive. He was informational and conversational. He told me liked my answers and was going to recommend me and I should hear a follow up within 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of hearing nothing and no response to my email checking on the status I still haven't heard anything. But I've spoke to a few people that have interviewed there and never hear back.

The initial interview I had with the Director resulted in a no call no show on the employers side. I got a call days later and came in for a second attempt at interviewing and again the Director was late in the morning so I was waiting to be interviewed for 30 minutes before the Sr. Recruiter interviewed me. Then when the Director got into work he interviewed me and was very unprofessional saying comments like “Wow! A hockey. How professional!” To an obvious birthmark! Along with statements like “Did you really work at these spots if you can’t remember some of the details to them?” And “Tell me what you want to my questions because I know all your old bosses personally so they’re just a phone call away!” So in a nutshell I’m not only insulted by my experience but also frustrated and bewildered how this guy even has a job! While I’m the only professional looking for one. That’s the real WOW factor of this whole thing!!!! The world these days.,0.9979571,0.0018878299,0.00015502854
The interview was very unprofessionally handled. The interviewer made me wait almost 20 minutes and interviewed me for only 5 minutes. It seemed as though he did not previously review my resume before inviting me to the interview because he asked for a copy of my resume during the interview and appeared to be reading it for the first time.  After scanning my resume for around 30 seconds the interviewer immediately decided that my skills did not match the position requirements.

Campus President/Director insured all instructors had at least 5 yrs of experience and all continuing education certificates.

The interiew was held in the Campus President/Director's office. She had me shown around the campus after the interview and to the classroom I would be taking over. We both gained a mutual understanding that we had a similar work ethic and she expected 100% from her staff as the students deserved that for the time distance driving (many came from across the border or further East to one of the only UEI campuses in San Diego) and the money students paid in tuition for their education.,0.0007730887,0.9982626,0.0009643402

I was never called for 3rd interview which was promised and they have conducted a background investigation yet have not called to make an offer or to tell me that I did not get the position. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.,0.99881196,0.0010401313,0.00014783897

UEI called a week before to schedule an interview with me for the Financial Planning position.  Basically the interviewer along with her associate asked me about 20 indepth financial aid questions really quizzing me on the details.  Although I answered all of the questions correctly I did find out at the end of the interview that they had been interviewing for several weeks to fill just ONE  yes ONE position.  So basically I knew at that point that my chances were slim because that opens the door for superficiality when you're quizzing that many applicants to fill 1 spot.  At this point we must all accept that in this economy the employer treats 1 job opening as a pageant of sorts..pageant of unemployed freaks if you will...trying to see who will suck up or beg for the job the most and choose 1 pathetic soul for the honorable PAPER pusher role.  Don't worry I'm not bitter...  Based on what I've seen on this site don't go if asked because you may just be wasting your time as it seems customary that this company overinterviews based on how few openings are available.,0.99683064,0.0030035076,0.00016585624
My interview experience along with the 100 individuals who interviewed was absolutely horrible!!!  Unfortunately UEI College preys on unemployed individuals desperate for work.

The interview was somewhat unorganized.  I felt the interview was rushed and not well presented.

I am actually quite surprised at the level of unprofessionalism I experienced while interviewing with the Office of International Programs. I interviewed for a position from out of state and was invited to an on campus interview. I took a very last minute vacation day from my job to fly down for the interview. The hotel they lodged me at had cockroaches (one crawled out of my bag in the morning!) were dressed very casual and started late. I ended up not getting an offer and I learned in a very short one liner email no opening closing. When I emailed to ask for feedback to improve future interviewing I got ZERO response. OIP needs to remember that people take time off work go through crazy travel schedules to get to Wilmington and go through a hassle and it is extremely rude and unprofessional to not have a shred of decency or professionalism to respond to someone who went out of their way to come visit your office and university.,0.9986619,0.00117029,0.00016790199

Overall everyone on the faculty was incredibly warm and welcoming. I was invited for an oncampus visit which included a job talk and teaching demo. But unfortunately I could tell almost immediately that I was not a serious candidate for them. Our first meal outing after my arrival an individual on the committee kept commenting on how young my age is and how little teaching experience I had. I could tell right away that I was only invited so this tenure searching committee could meet their invite quota. Truly disheartening (and inappropriate) as I had spent months prepping for my visit. The dean was about 15 minutes late to our 30minute meeting. I quickly was able to see that all I was to them was a fresh MFA grad student who they wanted details from because they are looking to start their own MFA program in the same field. I feel used.

I think the presentation portion which took up half of the onsite time was a poor metric for onthejob performance. I was not notified of the status of my application afterward and had to reach out. I was not given mileage though I drove from out of state. Sluggishness was continually blamed on HR. Overall a very poor experience.,0.9983139,0.0015542746,0.00013183524
Way too much waiting. The interview process took about 5 weeks with 3 interviews total (1 phone interview and 2 in person panel interviews). 5 weeks was how long it took them to tell me they needed someone who already knew the computer system and that was my ONLY downfall. Otherwise i was a great candidate according to them. This was for a very entry level role meaning skills are easily taught. my advice—start as a RazorTemp if you really want to work here and if you were never a student. Its not completely the university’s fault its the government that makes these extensive requirments for employment. Nonetheless a lot of my time and energy was wasted.

Very fast process. A quick phone screen followed by a zoom interview. All scheduled within 24 hours after I applied. Zoom call was pretty casual despite having 4 or 5 people asking questions.  Seems like an okay job just not what I wanted. 100150 phone calls a day is expected and they're not exactly cold calls but they may as well be  because they're inquiries about online learning in general not the university specifically.

I was invited to a ""finalist"" interview and asked to interview panel members and complete a writing test which would be followed by more takehome writing.  I was given an APstyle editing test using traditional proofreader’s marks along with a PR writing piece both to be completed within a half hour. Manager told me to do editing first.    I had conveyed that I hadn’t done AP writing in a number of years. I haven’t seen manual proofing since high school.  For the PR piece I was given several sentences and no other instructions. There was no time to complete it after the editing. The takehome assignment was an article and social posts based on PR piece.  The next day the manager demanded via email my personal notes/questions from my ""interview."" I asked later after the process what the purpose of this was.  He never answered me. The lengthy interview process in my opinion was never completely transparent and I received a negative response when I asked questions about it (from the hiring manager). The department assistant on the other hand was very polite and helpful.  While this was  partially a web editing job there were no tests given for coding. I was tested on my selfrevealed weaknessAPstyle editing.  The other ""finalist"" had a journalism degree and specialized in sports writing. He also did AP editing.   I asked if there was an internal candidate. There was a long awkward silence before one panel member said “uh no.”  They hired an intern who worked at U of D at the time of the posting. He is a white male and less than half my age. Had I known there was such a candidate I would have withdrawn from the process early on.  After job rejection I wrote thank you letters to seven of the panel members. Two members wrote back to wish me well.  Other: Marketing department diversity: two women one possibly Asian seven apparentlywhite males.   The University sports marketing department appeared to be all males last I checked.   I was a minority candidate.  I lost out on a parttime opportunity while waiting out this nine week ""process.""   U of D Mercy posts the following on their website: ""University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy is an Equal Opportunity Employer and considers all candidates for employment equally regardless of age color national origin race sex or handicap. Because of its status as a religious entity the school may consider a candidate’s religious affiliation in its employment decisions consistent with State and Federal law.""

But the hiring manager did not respond to my followup emails and Human Resources did not send a formal ""we've moved on"" email until ~4 months after.

"The first step was a phone call with an HR representative that felt more like a ""Let me tell you about all the great reasons you should come to work for us!"" versus an actual interview. Following that I was called in for a firstround 1 hour panel interview oncampus.  When I arrived there seemed to be some confusion as to my application materials and the interviewers seemed to have trouble getting organized. The interview started 25 minutes late and hence ran over the hour slot by about 30 minutes. After a week I was contacted by phone by the hiring manager who proceeded to point out various gaps and perceived flaws in my resume as it related to the position I interviewed for and then asked if I would be interested in applying for a position in the same office that was of a lesser status and would pay 10k less than the position I had applied for. I expressed that it would be hard for me to rationalize taking a role that was so beneath my target salary.  Despite being told multiple times that I would hear back in the coming weeks regarding my candidacy I never received a followup message to let me know that I wasn't actually being considered or that the position closed and they went with someone else. I finally wrote to the original HR representative that I spoke with for an update and over a week and a half since that email still have heard nothing.

I normally don't give feedback to places I have applied for but this process was so slow. They posted the job in August of 2019. I applied and it took over a month before I heard anything back. I was scheduled an interview and then they didn't let me know until a month later if I was hired or not. I understand it takes time but people can't wait for little over two months for hiring. The process was too slow and not very professional for a college.,0.9989492,0.0008937356,0.00015706118

This was a contract job at the State Lab in Baltimore. Initial interview was with the division chief to describe the job salary benefits and whether or not to proceed with the next step. 2nd interview was a panel of 5 people that were state workers from different positions within the various laboratories. Interview was about an hour. They had a combination of technical and behavioral questions. I think between 1520 questions were asked. It wasn't about getting to know me and whether I would be a good fit but rather to ask the mandatory questions.,0.05538097,0.94428855,0.00033047897
I applied for the PICU in mid August and interviewed late August. I interviewed with the nurse manager. I shadowed a couple nurses for two hours after the interview and saw a good variety of patients and the type of disorders I'd be caring for. Per the manager's request I came back for a second shadow day and was there for an hour and walked around with one nurse. I thought the manager had liked me and I asked plenty of questions but the stars weren't aligned for me this time.

The hiring manager was very easy to talk to and put me at ease. I didn't get an offer unfortunately. I really wasn't well prepared for the interview.

He mentioned that the whole lab was moving across the country and while very shocking was doable since I did my PhD in a state I didn't live in anyway.  He seemed impressed and I got the distinct impression I'd be offered the job.  He called to offer it to me within a week or two.,0.00042734656,0.9975286,0.0020439671

After two interviews I thought the University of Portland would do the correct thing and contact the candidates about the next steps or the decision to go with another candidate but they did not.

"At first I thought this was a very standard interview process. I submitted my application and was invited for a 30minute phone interview a couple weeks later. The phone interview was with the director and the person leaving the position I was applying for. They asked standard questions very simple.  Then I was invited for an oncampus halfday interview. I had a panel interview with the office staff a panel interview with community partners and a 1:1 interview with the associate VP. These all went fine very standard behavioral questions about what I would do in certain situations.  I was emailed several days after with a final project that candidates ""were recommended but didn't have to"" complete. This consisted of creating infographics and an email based on a dataset I was given. It was a little strange but easy enough for me so I did it.  Another week went by and I received a very generic voicemail from the director saying they decided to move forward with another candidate. After a couple weeks I looked on their website to see who they hired for the position and this is what made me really angry. They decided to promote an internal candidate from their office to the position. Normally I think this is fantastic I think we should always promote internally when we can. However this person was on my interview panel and a big part of the interview process for me! Something is very wrong and inequitable about this. If you have a strong internal candidate they absolutely should not be involved with the interviews of other candidates.

Weeks later I received a phone call leaving a message to call back. I returned the call to be informed I wasn't selected for the position but was told my resume was impressive. Awkward.

"They brough four individuals of whom they described as being exceptional candidates in to inverview for the position.

How does a supposedly intelligent group of people not fully evaluate the position before even posting it  let alone bringing four ""exceptional candidates"" in for an eight hour interview? I'd suggest that it's poor leadership and knowledge.  Funny as the position has been reposted and looks the same as it did before.

I submitted an application online in March. I was contacted in April to interview by telephone. I interviewed by telephone two weeks later. I heard nothing.   Two weeks later in May I was notified by a reference that they were contacted (without my knowledge). I followed up with the school. I finally heard back. They wanted me to come to campus. Initially it was one day. Then it became 3. They paid to fly me from the East Coast. I visited all three campuses. No time to think. One meeting after the other. The time scheduled with some was too short with others too long. I had to give a presentation.  Driven by Lincoln Town car to all locations.   I was told on campus  they were going to check my references. (They lied. They didn't.) I was asked to think about where I wanted to put my office. (Strange) They took me on a residential tour and to see a marina (neither on schedule).   They required me to interview with yet another person by telephone when I returned from my overnight flight home. I did. I sent thank you notes to each individual person. I heard back from some not others.   I left Thursday evening arriving home on Friday AM. I interviewed by telephone with the last person on Saturday afternoon (we tried to interview on Friday but I missed the call  go figure; I called back and heard nothing to Saturday).  Monday was July 4. I followed up on Monday July 11.  That afternoon I received an email from the a senior staff member who was my contact throughout claiming to have hired someone who had experience the opposite of mine.   The senior staff member who was my contact stopped responding. A secretary referred me to a low level staff person for reimbursements. This person's email responded on July 12 with an autoreply saying she was out until the 25th. Yah. I haven't sent them yet. Why rush. No one is there to help me.   Overall  they did a good job of being phony. They kissed my butt while I was there but they never intended to hire me. I was the national candidate. They were dishonest in things they told me. Ultimately they hired someone the opposite of me who had a lesser pedigree than I had and I felt it was a waste of time and resources.  The person they did hire was the same age and had the same look as the President.   Their behavior afterward scurrying under a rock ruined any good impression they gave me. I felt used and they clearly chose to cater to the chosen one rather than wrap up their interaction with me in an appropriate way. It was a little too Los Angeles for Northern California.   I wish I hadn't gone through the process. I feel like a used discarded date.  How ironic.,0.9974527,0.0024004164,0.0001468605

However the interview went extremely well and I quickly felt very comfortable with everyone in the room.  Most everyone was very nice however there was one person in the interview who I felt uncomfortable with.  Either way I left the interview feeling confident that I had done well and knew that I would accept an offer if they gave it.  Within the same week I was called to meet with the head of the department for a second interview 1:1.  I was much more nervous in this interview.  Unfortunately the person I interviewed with did a lot of talking but not very much listening.  By the time I was done with the interview I knew all about them but they knew very little about me.

The hiring and interview process was clearly very well planned and managed. The application process was long and required a lot of work in document preparation but it made sense. For example you are asked to provide a document which outlines your teaching philosophy which made me think that the selection panel would use this to ensure a good match between the candidate's approach and the Business School's approach. The actual interview process was almost a whole day. It began with lunch with key faculty. I liked this because it felt less formal less stressful. However I did have lots of questions fired at me during the meal!  What became clear to me during lunch was that my new colleagues had a very similar view of education to me and I was impressed by the Dept. Chair's sense of humor. I got the impression that I would be very happy working with these people. The lunch was followed with a number of short interviews with key faculty including the Dean. I then had a short break before I had to teach a class. This was the most stressful part of the process. I had been given plenty of notice and support to be able to prepare effectively but it is still stressful to be observed in action. After my session I was thanked by the faculty and one member then explained what would happen next. Overall I felt that the whole process was highly professional and that all the activities were appropriate for selecting a good candidate. At the end of the day I felt that I'd done a good job and was hopeful. It felt like a fair and well balanced process and I was confident that if I was not selected that there had genuinely been someone who was a better fit or performed better than me.,0.01133258,0.98156905,0.007098324

I applied online and was contacted to set up a phone interview. The phone interview was rushed and the interviewer didn't even take time to fully introduce the position. I was definitely not expecting the 2 part highly specific behavioral questions for a first phone interview especially with such a low salary being offered. Do yourself a favor and ask about salary before you agree to an interview with this University. The pay is super low for what they are expecting of candidates.,0.9989189,0.00091402227,0.00016702629

I met with 5 people and had a positive experience. I was told I would hear back and did not. I followed up and received an apology and explanation as to why I had not heard back. I followed up again after not hearing back some time after that and received much of the same as before. Finally after nearly 3 months I got a form letter response back from the university not even the people I had been in contact with telling me the position had been filled.

I interviewed here a while back and it was a pretty strange process. At one point the hiring manager dropped me off in a shared office space where the new hire would work alongside  two men. These two gentlemen were clearly not trained or prepared for interviewing a potential candidate. Here's how one of the exchanges went:  Guy #1: Where do you live? Do you own or rent? Me: Um I own a house in... Guy #1: Are you married? Do you have kids? Guy #2: I'm not sure we can ask that. Guy #1: Why not? She's wearing a ring. Me: Yeah I don't mind answering but you're really not supposed to ask. Guy #1: Well I'm trying to determine if you have a lot of home responsibilities that might interfere with your work or prevent you from traveling.  Needless to say I was pretty uncomfortable. This was the only time I've ever been relieved to not have gotten a job offer. I contacted the HR department later to tell them what happened.

"Applied for a position through WIT's online application process which was fairly standard in that regard.  Eventually was approached for a phone interview via email.  However after replying to the email about the scheduled interview appointment time I did not receive a replied confirmation until the day before the day before the actual interview (i.e. I was given several dates and times that were available and after my selection I was not notified until just before that we would be speaking at the one I had chosen).  This may just be a pet peeve of mine as they did contact me and I was given my chosen time slot but  was sitting on pins and needles leading up to that.    The interview itself was standard and average in most respects with nothing out of the ordinary with regard to this position.  After the completion of the interview we discussed the schedule for the process.  I was told a time frame I believe it was to be within two weeks that I would be informed if I was to move on or not.  Two weeks came and went without a word.  After the third week I emailed the person I interviewed with but I heard no reply for over another week.  Eventually I received a standard ""Sorry but..."" email from a different administrator.  It is very easy to send out a ""No"" to someone if they are not in the running either by yourself or have the automatic system do it for you (even easier) instead of wasting everyone's time not replying to inquiries.  Simple as that.",0.9978382,0.0020097466,0.00015200653

I was first interviewed  by phone with a hiring manager in Human Resources.  After this initial screening I went on campus for a multipart interview.  First with the person on the phone next with the senior officer in the department and finally with the manager I would report to.  I felt the interview with the senior manager went very well and she all but made the offer official in our chat.  The manager that I would report to was luke warm.  I did not get to interview with colleagues in the department or campus partners.  I did on a subsequent visit meet with the one subordinate staff member reporting to the position I applied.  The information given was positive and reflected very well on the Institution.  However in looking back the information was not accurate or truthful for the position after the initial Human Resource meeting.  The office environment was cold not welcoming.  The space was quiet and not conducive to collegial partnerships.  Those were first impressions.,0.98318523,0.016495995,0.00031879084

I was invited to participate in a phone interview by email about one week after applying. I provided my availability in response to an email and then heard back days later “can you interview today [in next four hours]?” I obliged because I was still available. The interviewer was from HR initially said “please be brief in your responses this interview is only 45 minutes long and we need to get through the entire set of questions.” I responded concisely barely expanding upon my experience and the interviewer still interrupted me making me feel like I needed to rush to get through all the questions. Interviewer was also speaking so quickly I needed the question to be repeated and I felt like the interviewer wasn’t paying attention. After all that the interview lasted 15 minutes. If I get selected to move on to the next interview I plan to turn them down.  The process was too unprofessional and I don’t think I would feel comfortable working here. I was told the next step after this preliminary HR interview would be to complete an assignment then participate in a panel interview.,0.9970853,0.0027461087,0.0001686333
I applied to the position and was contacted after two months for an interview via email. I was very excited and had two consecutive interviews the same week. First was a screening phone interview with a recruiter in which I explained that my unemployment gaps because of COVID and I decided to switch my career path (hence that’s why I am applying to jobs). The person was unprofessional when I spoke about what I was doing while I didn’t  have a full time position for over year. I explained that I work as a freelancer on projects and volunteer my time while extensively looking for a job. Frankly I was disappointed but still wanted to continue with the interview. Looking for a job in 2021 and then now 2022 has been emotionally draining and everyone seem to be ghosting candidate (at least my experience so far). I kept my cool and then they contacted me the next day for a meeting for the following day with the hiring manager and I was very excited speaking to them and moving forward within the process. The interview went well from what I can say they seemed  to be impressed with my background and career. The hiring manager informed me that I should hear back in two weeks since they were other interviews scheduled with other candidates (fair enough). I expressed my enthusiasm and I didn’t followed up until two weeks after the interview. I followed up with the recruiter and they  told me that they haven’t heard anything from the hiring manager and they will keep me posted. I was never contacted for an update and basically they’ve ghosted me. I understand that I might not be the right candidate for everyone but I am a person who took time out of my schedule to apply speak to the employer over the phone and prepared for the interview. The very least they could do is keep me updated after the interview. After this experience I wouldn’t be interviewing or applying anymore to this company. Thanks for another useless waste of my time.,0.9910629,0.008464702,0.00047249542
Online application phone interview video interview. The recruiter was late for the phone interview. The most important question is what your salary requirements are. Asked me a few times and lowballed me (way BELOW average). Could not answer technical questions questions were answered with “it is in the job posting”.

"During the early stages of the interview process I felt that the HR team at WES was very professional and prompt in their responses. I had an initial phone interview with a member of the HR team then was contacted about a Skype interview with the head of the department I would be working with along with another team member. While I was often told one thing about the timeline it tended to take longer than they estimated. I finally did a writing task as part of a final round and was told they would make their decision after that.   I was shocked to receive an email after going through all three rounds of the interview process that the hiring manager had decided to ""restructure the role"" and closed the posting.

"I was interviewed by 4 faculty just before the beginning of the Fall term. Each asked questions about my research and my teaching.  But mostly it was to convince me that they had the facilities for my research. However they emphasized how much the teaching load was and the amount of committee work they had to do since the faculty did all the work for many of the administrators. They used this time to tell me of the sad history of previous presidents who established a reign of terror.  I was also interviewed by the chair of the department who had been there during that time and told me that ""academic freedom"" were not words that could be used safely there. Then I was interviewed by the Dean who basically retold me the story about meeting tenure. It was up or out (although clearly not applied evenly to everyone there as I was soon to discover.) I learned that he could pretty much overrule what my fellow faculty members wanted in that decision. Since there are extremely few tenuretrack faculty positions due to a steady decline in them since the 1970's and increasingly greater numbers of adjunct positions of temporary faculty doing all the teaching in most colleges and universities I could not decline this position. There were none others at that time.  92% of STEM PhDs cannot get jobs requiring a PhD and thus makes the continued education for a PhD next to worthless or one of only increasing debt if one pursues PhD level jobs. I also gave a presentation about my research. The presentation was supposed to show my lecture style since most professors still use this as their teaching mode. However I enclosed materials from my teaching portfolio for past courses which included the use of case studies for discussion by group work in my lecture classes and some lab exercises I had created for various courses that overlapped with those I would teach at this university.  So most of the interview process was to tell me how important it was to have some realization of the environment I would be moving into. But I found out that this was only a tiny tiny bit of the reality check I needed to survive here.",0.9970204,0.0028370752,0.00014250135

The overarching feeling when I left my interview was that my time wasn’t valuable m. I definitely understand that things come up but in those situations communication is key. I waited over 15 minutes past the scheduled time for the interviewers to arrive. At the end of the interview they wanted me to meet with the CEO but didn’t know when he would be available. I was asked to wait in the area for an hour so they could call me to schedule that appointment. I waited for over an hour and then reached out. Reception was unable to get ahold of anyone from the panel I had met to ask what was going on. I didn’t get a call until over two hours after my interview ended. When I didn’t answer the person did not leave VM but proceeded to call a few more times and then leave a VM. This was all a huge red flag for me. If I’m not even on payroll and I’m being treated this way how bad would it be if I were to actually work there? I emailed the recruiter and withdrew my application.,0.99854314,0.0013165756,0.00014040103
The interview process was short and simple. I got contacted by a recruiter after submitting my resume. I had a phone screening then a week later I got called in for an interview. On interview day the person that was supposed to interview me was 20 minutes late. She was very unprofessional and  seemed like she wanted to get the interview over with. When I was answering the questions she kept cutting me off and kept asking other questions. I did not feel welcomed by her at all and she did not seem personable. Gee and she did not even write my answers down she was just asking questions from the top off her head.  One thing that also annoyed me was she kept saying that the position I applied for is the same as my current position now when it totally isn't. Out of all the interviews I have been through this one was the WORST! Be professional and show that you care for crying out loud.

"Standard 2day faculty interview process. Dinner with interview committee day of interviews research and teaching talks meeting with various HR. Met with students at my request. Third day meeting with ""higher ups"" both of whom kind of grilled me and didn't seem especially interested in answering my questions.  Everyone was very polite and professional.  Some of my questions were not answered or were given vague answers. E.g. no information on salaries would be provided. Answers suggested that research start up was limited to a few thousand dollars and there were no research lab facilities associated with the position. Internal funding for research expenses (annual funding) is good  fairly easy to get annual grants of $5000 to $10000 from the university system. North Carolina Universities do not offer sabbaticals (there is something alternate you can apply for but they are often rejected). Health care cost for family is about $6500 annually which comes out of salary. Raises for successful promotion to associate and full professor are flat rates of around $4000 and $6000 if I remember correctly. I was informed that most people do make tenure. The culture of the program seemed very healthy and good and there was a very strong interest in the well being of the students.  Did not follow up with me for 2 months  I inquired with search chair and immediate received a canned rejection email from HR. I requested feedback from the search committee chair on my interview (how to improve etc.) and received an email that the search committee does not make the decisions (the higher ups do) and so they have no feedback to give.

They had a lot of lags I couldn't see anyone's face clearly the room echoed (which was distracting at first but I eventually become used to it) and the four person panel used one microphone  so it was hard to hear the two people at the ends of the table even when I turned the volume up.   The questions themselves were pretty standard  why do you think you would be good for this position? Tell us about a time you had to work on a team? How are you with time management? They took turns asking the questions and made sure to leave time for me to ask them questions as well.   I would just rate this a neutral experience due to the skype issues but then they committed my biggest pet peeve of interviewing. They said they would get back to within a week but I never heard from them again. I sent a thank you email the day after the interview and a few days after they promised to get back to me I sent another thank you email also asking for my application status  but still no reply. After taking time off work in order to interview with them and the time spent making sure skype was working well on my side I feel like I at least deserved an email letting me know I didn't get the job.,0.9971289,0.002716017,0.00015510859

Interviews with faculty staff and a student rep. Chance to teach a class to show your skills. Sometimes informal lunch interviews happen in addition. I'd advise applicants to prepare their best work for the teaching demonstration and plan for spending a 1/2 day at the college. Come with prepared questions do some research about the program for which you're interviewing. The faculty are welcoming but bright and savvy they'll hone in on your skills and intentions so don't take the interview lightly.

I submitted my resume and website portfolio for review and then received a call from HR for a phone interview. The person interviewing me was 15 minutes late in calling this was a prescheduled interview made by their HR department. My rapport with the woman interviewer went well. We were both clear and candid with each other. The marketing department sounded like it was in transition so I don't feel they were clear in what they needed. I was over qualified but willing to take a lower position due to my life circumstances. I am writing this review to let others who interview know that they don't get back to you even if you politely email and leave phone messages asking for a courtesy call to let you know if the position was filled and where you stand in the process. During the interview she was very encouraging about my portfolio and potential of working in their department. They ask you questions of faith and integrity. Overall disappointed that they seek others with faith and integrity but their actions don't shown those qualities. Actions in this case do speak louder than words. No decency in providing even a brief response. A return email or voicemail saying they weren't interested was simply right thing to do. Especially from a faith based college.,0.98495734,0.014628925,0.00041380426

Interview process was overkill. Interviewed with every department department partners etc. Two day process. As well as interview with the President of the College. I was not impressed with the interview format talking to at least 50 people with 50 different opinions and always referencing (being compared to) the incumbent was not a good way to conduct interview. I also got the impression that some panel members had misconceived ideas about my content knowledge or that I could not relate to academically gifted students.,0.998679,0.0011836402,0.00013734312

One interview with director of office. Very easy interview. Asked about previous work experience and willingness to work flexible hours. Very few requirements to get the job. Not competitive either.,0.049456015,0.2839251,0.6666189
I talked with people who had done the job in the past and spent time with them learning how the machine worked and proving that I knew how to use the machine.  The interview process was very easy and willingness to do the job is the primary qualification.,0.0055889897,0.08682945,0.9075815

A brief 20 minute interview that was friendly and relaxed but still thorough. It was a one on one with the person looking to hire two new interns for the position. I did not feel stressed in the situation and left wanting to work for the employer because they made the job seem like a very valuable experience in the end it was.,0.005115681,0.1107694,0.8841149

Brief on my part. I submitted a resume and cover letter then received a call asking to set up a phone interview. The phone interview was with 5 people and lasted only 10 minutes which is a little short to really get a good feel for a candidate but it was an initial screening.   I didn't make it past that portion but the hiring manager was tremendous in making a personal phone call to inform me that I would not be considered past that point for the position because they are going with candidates with more experience and thanking me for applying and taking the time to interview over the phone.   That was truly the most professional experience I've had with a potential employer and deserves to be noted. I can't even be miffed that I didn't get the position because they treated me with the utmost respect.,0.047440294,0.40190956,0.5506502

I filled out an application online. The manager got back to me within a few days. I came in for an interview and the manager showed me around a bit. I wasn't asked much other than what my availability was and when I could start then the manager offered me the job right away.,0.00047939687,0.99888843,0.000632122
Set of scenario related questions on how you interact with customers. Customer service and good workplace relationships are key. It's only one round. No prior manager experience is needed.

The interviewing process was very good. I liked the interviewing process a lot. Some really good processes were used in the interviewing process. I wish every employer used their interviewing process. The world would be a better place if their interview processes were used everywhere. Really outstanding interview processes and a really good experience. I hope this helps inform people about the really good interviewing process here. More people should know about how good the interviewing process is. Yeah.,0.007905373,0.7686735,0.2234212

Start with applying the position online through the Wisconsin Union website. Either HR or managers will contact you through phone or email to schedule an interview with you if they deem you qualified for the position. For my position most of the interview questions are simple and straightforward such as “tell us about your self.” “why are you interested in this position?”. Spanish fluency would be a plus.,0.00078496884,0.9986368,0.0005782177
The initial interview was a 30 minute interview with two members of the team. Both team members were unenthusiastic when talking about the organization and their roles. They also were not showing respectful listening.,0.9989446,0.0009150116,0.0001404114

Started process back in the last week of March with a phone interview. Had a zoom interview with the team two weeks later and a final interview a week after that. It’s been a month since the last interview and I’ve yet to hear anything. Honestly this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Even if  I wasn’t what they were looking for leaving a candidate hanging for a month plus after the whole process speaks volumes of the organization.,0.9978205,0.0020513982,0.00012807394
This company was Red Flags R Us. I also don't know where the POC were but I sure didn't see any during the interview process so I definitely saw what people here meant by the lack of diversity. For this job the low 42k salary and nature of work seems to attract privileged upper/middle class (white from what I saw) people who don't have college loans have help from their parents and/or very little in college debt. A few of the red flags I noticed: they said even if a worker had experience with a country they purposely didn't have that person work on that country. The way the management answered some of the questions regarding reviews here. The lack of diversity. The similarity of the people working there. The salary. The lack of upward mobility.  Also other NGOs/nonprofits I interviewed with said before the interview process something along the lines of 'I'm sorry but unfortunately we don't offer relocation assistance is that okay with you?' whereas here I had to ask the interviewers about relocation as it was automatically assumed you'd be moving on your own dime for a 42k salary; I know that moving on your own is standard with most NGOS but I like that others had the courtesy of letting people know and not making that automatic assumption. I ended up signing with another NGO with nicer employees offering 9k more before I heard back from them.,0.99591225,0.0039329524,0.00015478452
Standard 30minute interview over Skype that started off with them talking about their program asking about why you qualify for the internship along with followup questions.

I applied online and received an interview invitation several weeks later.  I went to their office for the interview and noticed many red flags  the interview itself gave me the impression that they are very disorganized and overworked.  There was no greeting or direction at the lobby.  They were running over 30 minutes late and never told me.  I sat there and listened to the entire interview for the candidate ahead of me watching her through the clear glass of their conference room right next to the lobby.  When her interview was done she left and no one came to get me.  I watched the interviewer leave  she walked passed me without a word.  Finally a long time later she came back to me very flustered.  I had to help her set up her laptop again in the conference room and connect with the program director [who was offsite].  The interviewer was inexperienced with setting up video conference calls and I had to do it for her all the while trying to introduce myself and talk to her about my experience. When we finally connected with the program director she only asked me a couple questions.  I know that I answered them very strongly  I was overqualified for the position.  The interviewer didn't have my CV or cover letter in front of her so I had to give her a copy.  I expected her to ask me to reschedule the interview given all the technical difficulties but she did not.  I was rushed out of the room after only 20 minutes with the interviewer telling me that she hadn't had lunch yet that day.  The candidate before me had nearly an hour with the interviewer and they didn't ask me any of the questions they had asked her.  I never heard back after the interview which was just as well because I wouldn't want to work for an organization that treats an interviewee in this way.  I should add that I am an alumnus of SIT and a donor to World Learning so I was very disappointed by this experience.,0.99848384,0.0013761517,0.00013994914
Felt very impersonal compared to past years  probably budget cuts / less program staff and higher reliance on technology.  One way video interview (record your answers) then live skype interview.  I was not impressed with how the interviewer handled the fact that my feedback hadn't been provided in the live video interview but the hiring team lead did follow up and provide the feedback along with a chance to have a second conversation.,0.99869895,0.0011551357,0.00014588566
I applied online and received an email to schedule a phone interview promptly after. Someone in h/r asked a few FIT questions and some finance questions about journal entries. Two weeks later I got a call for 2nd round in person with another person in h/r and head of finance. Mostly FIT questions and also asked if i can do a bank reconciliation and journal entry for prepaid rent. Overall I would say it was a positive experience and would  apply again.  The office looked nice too. I can tell you this too when I went for the inperson interview I could see the diversity there: different ethnicities genders age ranges.,0.0019903337,0.8746126,0.123397
There is a part one which is online recorded interview and a part 2 which is a one on one live video interview. Part one will be recorded and you will have a little bit of more time to prepare. The live video interview is actually fun and a more personable experience because you get to learn more about the program.,0.0005010547,0.012744123,0.98675483
I applied online and was contacted for an interview about 1.5 week later. I interviewed with two members of the hiring team. One week following the interview I was asked to complete a case study exercise. The HR team checked my references (using a very lengthy questionnaire).  Then a few days after that I was informed via email from HR that the position was closed. This was the most frustrating part that they checked multiple references but did not make an offer or even contact me personally (the email from HR seemed to be automatically generated).,0.99843687,0.0014286271,0.0001344451

Applied online called me for a face to face interview three weeks after. On the same day called me for second round of interview two days after. The whole process was very weird. They asked me to fill out a lot of paperwork even before the second round of interview. They reached out to my references before the second round of interview. I had to find four previous supervisors who basically had to write an essay about me. They made me fill out a government form that asked for transcript and way too many information. I spend a lot of my time completing these paperwork. My references also had to spend a lot of time writing about me. However at the end I was not offered the position. My recommendation to World Learning is don't make people do some much work even before the second round of interview. This is a very bad practice. Please do not waste candidates time like this. I have serious doubts about how you treat your employees when you can't respects applicant's time.,0.9987931,0.0010650719,0.00014177636

There was an inperson interview with 4 people which lasted just more than an hour. About a week after I was asked to do a research task (simulating something similar to what the Program Associate would do on this project) and respond to them within a day.

Found this process incredibly frustrating. I applied online and heard very quickly. They wanted to bring me in almost immediately for an interview. Gave me little time to prepare or research.

I found out about the position through an online job board and sent an email with my resume and cover letter to the listed contact. About a week later the contact responded to my email asking if I would be available for an interview later that week. The interview was average. I was in a tiny room with two employees from the department that the internship was associated with. Following the interview I was asked to send them a list of professional references. I did so and never heard back from them again even after sending a followup email over a week later. To this day I have no closure on the status of this position so I have moved on and accepted another offer.,0.99650514,0.0033872575,0.00010758401
Unfortunatley this was probably the worst interview process that I've been through. Information and correspondence was incredibly patchy with two months between applying and getting invited for the first interview and another month passing between the first and final interviews. The interviewers themselves were lovely people during our conversations and the questions were very pointed to the position. However on the application website as well as in interviews I was told that I could ask questions and check on the selections process with staff. Because there was so much time between correspondences I reached out twice over the course of the four months and received no response either time from World Learning staff. It was a very frustrating and ambiguous process. Overall I felt disrespected as an applicant. It seems to be a very disorganized organization.,0.99493176,0.004632169,0.00043615766
