The great core values of the organization are not fully implemented by the people managers unfortunately.  There's relatively no clear and no objective measurement on employee's performance appraisal.  If you have good relationships with the people managers then you will be taken care of otherwise you would be on your own.  Lack of (almost no) recognition and lack of (almost no) rewards for the employees.  No matter how good you perform your works that would be considered as part of your roles and business as usual (BAU).  There is no promotion and career path at all.  Once you are in a certain position then you will be there all the way throughout your career life.  Unless you apply for a more senior position (if available and if approved by your direct supervisor and the user) then you will stuck on the same position for the entire life of your career in that organization.,0.99811506,0.0016661009,0.00021885242

"Narrow minded managers who tow the party line as cheerleaders; not caring about staff but only about the bottom line.  Salaries suck; any break or lunch is spent contacting insurance/case managers families or documenting.  No one works the standard 8hour day unless you're a manager.  We bring work home and spend hours documenting because the computer system keeps knocking you off line.  The focus is now the new hospital and unless you need something for that forget it.  And if  you work at an offsite facility you don't exist.  Management knows that staff will do anything for their patients and take full advantage of that.  RIC is the #1 rehab hospital in the world  how?  Because of dedicated staff.  So what did we get  a lousy tshirt!!!  Raises are so low as to be nonexistent  we're told we have the ""privilege of working at RIC and that should be enough.""  Not sure where you got the salaries listed but they are way off and below the national average.  The fact that they spend more money in recruitment than in retention should tell you something.

UNHCR does what it can to help their staff but there are still abusive managers in places far from their Geneva and Copenhagen  head quarters.,0.997881,0.0019720085,0.00014687315
There is a lot of affiliate work force that does the same or more than the amount of work of the UNHCR staff. However they get less benefits and have less protection. While they do the same amount they are treated like second class citizens.  Middle managers and officers are bullying and verbally abusive to  staff. However  management are often powerless to stop such abuses.  There has been incidences if reporting to higher ups but perpetrators are still in the system and nothing is done about their abusive behavior. Additionally assistants associates and affiliates are hesitant to speak up due to repercussions. This has already occurred in a certain office in south east Asia.  Managers are never reviewed by their staff which should be common on practice.,0.9988205,0.0010457955,0.00013370538

Low salary on contract but undocumented benefits like the unpredictable $3000 housing benefit made it work this year. Unfortunately only the salary is for sure after this year.  Management seems to enjoy putting faculty in difficult situations and offers little assistance. You may have to spend more then your housing allowance on hotel rooms because management can't decide how long you will be at a location. The military bases are not helpful because you are a contractor.  UMUC is in the process of eliminating all the textbooks. Therefore not much to teach from except free online resources meant for an online course which in some cases is inadequate and poor. You must keep the students entertained for 3 hour long classes and teach new courses every eight weeks so class prep consumes much time.  Since contracts go for 12 months until July 31 you will have difficulty finding a new job. Being in a foreign country also makes it difficult to interview for new job.
