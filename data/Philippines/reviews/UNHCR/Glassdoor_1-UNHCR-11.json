However, they get less benefits and have less protection. While they do the same amount, they are treated like second class citizens. \n\nMiddle managers and officers are bullying and verbally abusive to  staff. However,  management are often powerless to stop such abuses.  There has been incidences if reporting to higher ups, but perpetrators are still in the system and nothing is done about their abusive behavior.\n\nAdditionally, assistants, associates, and affiliates are hesitant to speak up due to repercussions. This has already occurred in a certain office in south east Asia.  Managers are never reviewed by their staff, which should be common on practice."}], []]
