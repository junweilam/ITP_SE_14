Unfortunately, only the salary is for sure after this year.  Management seems to enjoy putting faculty in difficult situations and offers little assistance. You may have to spend more then your housing allowance on hotel rooms, because management can't decide how long you will be at a location. The military bases are not helpful because you are a contractor.\r\n\r\nUMUC is in the process of eliminating all the textbooks. Therefore, not much to teach from except free online resources meant for an online course, which in some cases is inadequate and poor. You must keep the students entertained for 3 hour long classes and teach new courses every eight weeks so class prep consumes much time.\r\n\r\nSince contracts go for 12 months until July 31, you will have difficulty finding a new job. Being in a foreign country also makes it difficult to interview for new job. I want to find a new job."}]]
