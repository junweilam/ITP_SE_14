Creative staff who go above and beyond to support patients rehab efforts.", "cons": "Narrow minded managers who tow the party line as cheerleaders; not caring about staff but only about the bottom line.  Salaries suck; any break or lunch is spent contacting insurance/case managers, families, or documenting.  No one works the standard 8hour day unless you're a manager.  We bring work home and spend hours documenting because the computer system keeps knocking you off line.  The focus is now the new hospital and unless you need something for that forget it.  And if  you work at an off-site facility, you don't exist.  Management knows that staff will do anything for their patients and take full advantage of that.  RIC is the #1 rehab hospital in the world -- how?  Because of dedicated staff.  So what did we get -- a lousy t-shirt!!!  Raises are so low as to be non-existent -- we're told we have the \"privilege of working at RIC and that should be enough.\"  Not sure where you got the salaries listed but they are way off and below the national average.  The fact that they spend more money in recruitment than in retention should tell you something.  They'll set me up with a weight management or smoking cessation program because we got millions from a trust, but not a dime for the stuff I really need to help my patients."}]]
