Frontline employees are not considered or have a voice. When coordinators finally get the courage to speak up and point disrespectful attitudes or screams from managers or directors the answer is the same from Human Resources: we know, we need to change but as long as the change does not come from the top it will not happen. Hang in there.\r\n\r\nGreat mission, great initiatives, you always learn in WRI Mexico. However all the knowledge does not justify a toxic and well accepted culture. \r\n\r\nExtra hours not paid, working during the weekends, your director taking all the credit for your work and an enormous pressure to respond not only to programmatic outcomes but financial outcomes. Directors should be hold accountable for the financial performance of their areas, not coordinators. \r\n\r\nThere is no space for professional growth. The work load keeps increasing and you remain a coordinator regardless of being responsible for so much more."}], [], []]
