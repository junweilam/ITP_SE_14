Even though I have only been working at Amnesty International for a month and a half I have already formed a highly positive opinion of the organization. One thing that has impressed me the most is the flexibility the company offers its employees. This has allowed me to balance my work responsibilities with my personal life in the best way for me. Additionally the overall work environment is fantastic. The company culture is welcoming and everyone is supportive and friendly. The camaraderie among colleagues is palpable and I feel amazingly comfortable asking for help or advice from anyone in the office. I also appreciate the respect and promotion of diversity that Amnesty International embodies. The company is committed to creating a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected regardless of their race gender sexual orientation or any other characteristic. Finally I am impressed with the company's dedication to the health and wellbeing of its employees. Even though I have only been working remotely I can see that the management team is highly committed to ensuring that everyone feels supported and cared for. Overall I feel extremely fortunate to be part of such an incredible organization and I look forward to continuing to grow and develop my skills while working here.,0.00043230527,0.00068341393,0.99888426
In my brief time working at Amnesty International I found the experience rewarding and fulfilling. However I believe the company could make some improvements in its onboarding process for new employees. I have found that the amount of knowledge required to succeed in my role is quite significant and the learning curve can be steep. While my colleagues have been incredibly supportive and helpful in answering my questions I believe a more robust onboarding program would benefit all new employees. For example the company could create a more structured training program that covers all aspects of the job including policies procedures and systems. This could help new employees better understand their role within the company and feel more confident in their abilities.,0.048765562,0.9314734,0.019761054

 Honorable mission and history.  Good pay and benefits,0.00030946825,0.00023584788,0.9994547
 Generally oldfashioned. Lacks flexibility and is extremely slow to include new methods new ideas new ways of working..  Since the change of leadership in 2021 the organization has been lacking vision and direction. It is not clear what CIMMYT wants to accomplish and how to get there. It has also changed the culture to mistrust and micromanagement. Along with the general lack of motivation caused by Covid and the merge with One CGIAR staffs are burning out and leaving.   Lack of transparency. Leadership never explains the reasons behind decisions or appointments. It is not even clear who is leading certain programs or departments.   Leadership doesn't trust other teams and units. Everything has to be micromanaged by the top leader and his clique. Initiative and proactivity are discouraged.   Shortsighted decisions and policies. Policies are applied and interpreted against staff just to save a few dolars.  Lack of professional development prospects. Zero possibilities to evolve to a higher role..,0.9990275,0.00082288287,0.00014952647

You work for a good cause contributing to a better world.  Multicultural environment is great.  There is a lot of staff committed to the mission and working together for a better world not only in their role but in their personal time too. Projects are super interesting and it’s a great place to learn because of the work and complex projects you work on. Despite the gender gap there are some concrete actions to reduce it.  There is a lot of effort in increasing transparency teamwork and eliminating discrimination and negative hierarchies but there is still a lot to do.,0.0003419259,0.0005870611,0.999071
Too much politics.  In half of the departments the heads/directors reward loyalty instead of performance or capacity.  There is still considerable discrimination vs national staff (normally paid 1/5 of foreigners) vs women vs young staff and vs administrative staff (scientist are always right whether they actually know what are they talking about or not).  There is no professional development plans and most supervisors are appointed because of personal favors or because they are technically good in their field but not because they know how to supervise.  There is a lot of harassment and the compliance officer only takes care of cases where the harasser is not her friend.,0.9983563,0.0014646725,0.00017903697
The best thing about working for CIMMYT is the international staff.  The multicultural environment is truly wonderful.  It is amazing to work with people from around the world with a shared commitment to improving food security. I also enjoy the international travel opportunities and the flexibility to work from my home country. Working in Mexico is made safe by the high security of the Texcoco campus and diplomatic immunity while driving CIMMYT vehicles. Central Mexico has lovely weather and offers a rich cultural experience.,0.00019253821,0.00025841536,0.999549
"The experience of workers is extremely dependent on program. The management of some programs is very poor. The turnover rate in upper management is high and the morale of some workers low.  The contained Texcoco campus offers security but little privacy for those that work and live there.  Internal politics can be overwhelming particularly for international workers who feel ""trapped"" professionally and personally.",0.99890983,0.00094224396,0.00014791
When you work with CIMMYT your work contributes to building the foundation of food system development on a world scale. A wonderful intercultural staff and work experience.....if that is what you are looking for and where you function well. This work affords you a great sense of purpose and significance in your day to day activities.,0.00019780254,0.00021694425,0.9995852
HUGE pay and benefits gap between national and international employees. This reality creates tension and an almost colonial feel to the institutional hierarchy.  CIMMYT struggles to play well with local national/host country institutions. There is often an impression (mostly unfair) of CIMMYT as elitist and somewhat of an ivory tower.  CIMMYT often lacks the institutional ability to navigate local politics institutional relations etc. because it is an agricultural scientific organization run by agricultural scientists. This results often in good science not making it to the field or to the intended recipients.,0.9985753,0.0012721445,0.00015250548

" Toxic work culture of gossip favoured (the DG openly encourages ""positive gossip!"")  Lack of accountability from managers and senior managers. Racism ageism bullying and harrassment prevalent at all levels enticed by upper management. Mexicans are discriminated and poorly spoken about in their own country by international staff in upper management positions.   Nepotism is present across the organization. Spouses are designated in decisionmaking positions without proper credentials.   Gross misconduct and gross ineptitude from managers in key departments mainly in human resources and finance mean that incorrect negligent practices are covered and unattended.",0.9967842,0.002823187,0.00039263285

Birthdays off.  Good benefits especially for those who negotiate better packages and special privileges than their colleagues and coworkers. Negotiation is common rather than standard staff policies and practices. If you're a good negotiator and a selfpromoter you'll do well for yourself. Anyone interested in a workplace where staff are treated equally and fairly steer clear.   Good benefits for families however those benefits (and any others) can be stripped away at any time. You and your family will be at the mercy of an organization that treats its employees like slaves. Anyone who protests will be swiftly threatened or given the boot and made an example of to others who might raise concerns.  Selfpromoters and nonperformers will feel right at home here. Anyone with any moral decency look elsewhere. Anyone with integrity who actually wants to focus their efforts on working towards the organization's mission will be disappointed and not recognized for their achievements and hard work.  The mission of the organization attracts a lot of decent intelligent and fantastic people. However after working here for some time these same people either turn into bullies themselves leave the organization or are sacked.,0.3384468,0.6488338,0.012719417
The last thing someone wants to worry about after working in an organization for 20 years is showing up one day and being told they’ve been sacked with no warning no notice and no explanation.  But this is common practice at CIMMYT.  Staff are regularly expected to work 6070 hours a week are poorly compensated and are terminated without notice or explanation. Bully mentality is common especially among senior management and filters down throughout the organization.  Underperformance and gross nonperformance of responsibilities are consistently ignored for preferred employees.  Nepotism and favouritism are rampant throughout the organization.  Save your talent energy and hard work for another organization that has a modicum of consideration for its employees.  Staff are expected to dedicate their entire life to the organization while anyone can be let go at any time regardless of their contract. Staff who decide not to work weekends or evenings will not last long. Upper managers don't have a personal life and expect staff to be virtually on call. Work/life balance is poor. If you don't comply you won't have a job.  Horrible management and treatment of staff have been well documented and raised as a concern by oversight bodies and independent councils. However there are no real mechanisms to hold management accountable. Minorities women and certain nationalities are targeted and treated especially unfairly. With no real mechanisms in place to rectify poor treatment of staff unethical practices go unchecked and are common.,0.9990396,0.00080106483,0.00015937575

Awesome organization to intern or work for if you are into social consulting. The staff and neighbors really is a family environment. I stayed with a host family who owned a family restaurant and I got free food every time I came by. They were so lovely and familyoriented.  I had one of my best summers staying in Bucerias Mexico.

The Pandemic exposed real culture in WRI Mexico where decisions are made in an old vertical way. Frontline employees are not considered or have a voice. When coordinators finally get the courage to speak up and point disrespectful attitudes or screams from managers or directors the answer is the same from Human Resources: we know we need to change but as long as the change does not come from the top it will not happen. Hang in there.  Great mission great initiatives you always learn in WRI Mexico. However all the knowledge does not justify a toxic and well accepted culture.   Extra hours not paid working during the weekends your director taking all the credit for your work and an enormous pressure to respond not only to programmatic outcomes but financial outcomes. Directors should be hold accountable for the financial performance of their areas not coordinators.   There is no space for professional growth.
