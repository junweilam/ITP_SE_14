All sign off has to come from the CEO, which causes massive delays, often myself and colleagues were not paid on time as our finance officer did not have access to our bank. \r\n\r\nExtremely exploitative of young people. Whilst it is a regular coinsurance in the sector for charities to 'hire' unpaid interns for short periods of time, Street Child regularly hired interns and kept them on for extended periods (6-9 months) without pay whilst giving vague allusions towards a future paid job. \r\n\r\nIn-country the reporting system is extremely poor, data from which reports are compiled is poorly collected, leading to uncertainties over the validity of Street Child's work. \r\n\r\nProgrammes Staff more often than not do not have contracts and are often paid an extremely 'cost neutral' salary that is actually just a basic stipend for food. Both of these combine to a high stress job which as there is no long time assurances over whether employees would be kept on, and employees could not afford a to book a flight back to the U.K due to the 'salary' that they are paid."}]]
