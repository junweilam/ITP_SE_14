Sometimes too eager to chase funds for projects that aren’t well justified because needs have been overblown by government or were understandably of concern before the situation stabilized or funding was duplicated by other organizations and other needs can’t clearly be identified. Finding good local staff is a huge challenge so managers can end up picking up the slack if you don’t have a strong team.Ops can be really slow at getting things done especially when things aren’t straightforward so the program managers have to make them happen.Working with governments donors and certain partners can be incredibly tedious.,0.99859124,0.0012458396,0.00016285757

Whilst working as an unpaid intern (which the vast majority of current Street Child employees have done) there is a great camaraderie in the office. Really warm and friendly office to work in.

Only 1 of the Senior Management team works in the office which slows everything down. All sign off has to come from the CEO which causes massive delays often myself and colleagues were not paid on time as our finance officer did not have access to our bank.   Extremely exploitative of young people. Whilst it is a regular coinsurance in the sector for charities to 'hire' unpaid interns for short periods of time Street Child regularly hired interns and kept them on for extended periods (69 months) without pay whilst giving vague allusions towards a future paid job.   Incountry the reporting system is extremely poor data from which reports are compiled is poorly collected leading to uncertainties over the validity of Street Child's work.   Programmes Staff more often than not do not have contracts and are often paid an extremely 'cost neutral' salary that is actually just a basic stipend for food. Both of these combine to a high stress job which as there is no long time assurances over whether employees would be kept on and employees could not afford a to book a flight back to the U.K due to the 'salary' that they are paid.,0.99912137,0.0007161149,0.00016253896
