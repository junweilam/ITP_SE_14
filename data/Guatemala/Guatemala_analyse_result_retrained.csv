Mayan Families  provides a great  experience where you are responsible for projects and proposals with real people that I was excited to work hard for! They provide an excellent work environment for those living abroad for the first or third time and for locals alike. It is an amazing opportunity to work with a Community oriented Non Profit.  I received training and had to run a lot of things myself which meant really pushing myself professionally! Great development and growth within Mayan Families! The benefits are amazing professional development and the ability to travel around Guatemala and up to Mexico for Visa runs. Great place to learn! Great handson experience in international development work working alongside local Guatemalans. Plenty of support.  The foundation and management seek to have a working environment that feels professionally supportive! Support from uppermanagement was always the best. They walk it every day! Great work enviroment. I wanted an excellent place to grow and learn to create future career opportunities.  Great company to grow as a young professional. Great people very smart Guatemalan staff!,0.00019169803,0.00019715399,0.9996112

I worked at Mayan Families in Panajachel Guatemala for 18 months and was amazed at everything I did there! The experience helped my professionally in so many ways! I grew as a person and I worked with so many talented Ex Pats and Guatemalans! This is the place to go if you want to see the real Guatemala! I only left to go back North to pay off student loans. I highly recommend Mayan Families! They have heart they do it correctly and they are one of the only NGO's to truly care about the Indigenous populations in Guatemala! I was always aware of my compensation time required at work and my responsibilities. If you want to make a real difference this is the place! If you want to deal with the hard choices and issues relating to poverty this is the place to work!,0.0012744163,0.0023429599,0.9963826

Major changes are afoot after separating from former founders and partner organization. All local staff is now paid at least minimum wage put in place proper financial management systems and controls to assure that donations reach community respecting local leadership to lead our work improved communication and morale among staff focus on measuring and improving the impact of our work.

Truly an eyeopening and amazing experience getting to work at a local NGO in beautiful Lake Atitlan Guatemala. If you are at all interested in international development public health/ policy global welfare microfinance international education etc. then an experience at MF will greatly accelerate your career and you will learn so much more than you would at an entrylevel position at an NGO in the US/ Europe/ AUS etc. Such inspiring work and amazing colleagues as well getting to work in a new culture and country and learn the customs is challenging at times but overall so rewarding. Would recommend 10/10 to anyone I know who is interested.,0.0006141322,0.0019483443,0.9974375

Hard working conditions on little pay. Low office moral. No experienced professionals at all only young and enthusiastic hires that do not have much prior experience. Little evaluation of programs leads to serious waste of donation funds. Hard to effect change in current systems. Management makes poor decisions with impunity. Organization caters too much to donors letting their funds determine how organization is run instead of basing operations on data and needs of local clients.,0.99903464,0.00079163426,0.00017375399
Amazing coworkers Working for a noble cause in an impoverished part of the world and an organization with a great track record! Openness to get involved in many aspects of projects within the organization. Lot's of work which I like. Living in Guatemala gives you an opportunity to learn travel and grow. I learned so much! The opportunities working at Mayan Families gave me for my career are amazing!

"Mayan Families embodies the development model that is doing it wrong  in other words ""bad aid."" They do try and work on some programs that seem to want to inspire change within communities longterm but the way that they operate is unfortunately without any understanding of development work and sustainability becoming more of a model that does more harm than good. They priortize the donor over what the sponsorship model is actually doing in communities and how indigenous families and communities are really benefiting becoming more ""poverty tourism"" than the sustainable development work that they boast. This is enhanced by the need to grow faster and expand instead of focusing on really doing projects with forethought expertise funds and collaboration within communities. Worst of all there is discrimination against indigenous staff who are paid dismal salaries even in comparison to the very low rates given to foreign ""volunteer"" staff. This is made further problematic by the daily ethically questionable aspects and choices made by the founders and directors at large who perhaps don't understand these issues or perhaps do not prioritize them. These directors also cultivate a general atmosphere of disrespect and distrust against all their employees either young foreigners or indigenous staff which further contributes to a negative work environment.",0.998516,0.0013214821,0.00016253283
