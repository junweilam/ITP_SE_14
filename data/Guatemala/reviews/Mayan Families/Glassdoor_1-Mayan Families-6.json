They priortize the donor over what the sponsorship model is actually doing in communities and how indigenous families and communities are really benefiting, becoming more \"poverty tourism\" than the sustainable development work that they boast. This is enhanced by the need to grow faster and expand instead of focusing on really doing projects with forethought, expertise, funds, and collaboration within communities. Worst of all, there is discrimination against indigenous staff who are paid dismal salaries even in comparison to the very low rates given to foreign \"volunteer\" staff. This is made further problematic by the daily ethically questionable aspects and choices made by the founders and directors at large who perhaps don't understand these issues or perhaps do not prioritize them. These directors also cultivate a general atmosphere of disrespect and distrust against all their employees, either young foreigners or indigenous staff, which further contributes to a negative work environment."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good intentions are not enough", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Coordinator in Guatemala", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good opportunity for career growth.", "cons": "No work life balance."}]]
