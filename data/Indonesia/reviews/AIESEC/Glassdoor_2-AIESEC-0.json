Basically AIESEC is just a money-machine organizations. You need money to be a member, attend local conferences, do volunteering\r\n4. Too many office politics to be considered 'achieved\" you need to accomplish all targets, but to be considered as \"position-fit\" you need to know who's your support system\r\n5. There is no fixed business conduct related to the membership. You could be cut anytime if you're not your team leader favourite\r\n\r\nMy advice to everyone who wants to join: there is no wrong to join this organization, but always remember your value. You needs to be respected, your work needs to be recognized, you need to have a support system, your works need to be rewarded (for example with certicate or salary). Always her your heart if this organization is not right for you then leave you deserve a better place. If you still a member who is struggling (love the environment, but hate the people) thats ok, if you think that you still need a learning just go for it but always remember that you need to be awarded in the end by earning a certficate and salary not just a personal development form a cliche jargon"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "AIESEC", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "28 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Local Committee President in Makassar", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Leadership\r\n- Empower Youth leaders\r\n- Organizational management", "cons": "- Constantly changing Executive Board each year. \r\n- Expensive national fee given to AIESEC International"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Head of Partnerships", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Jakarta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "to explore and upscale skills, open your networking", "cons": "only for youth and AIESECer members"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "A place to mature yourself", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Project Director in Jakarta", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Rewarded by the most democratic workplace, AIESEC maybe a not for profit organization but run like a start-up or social enterprise.
