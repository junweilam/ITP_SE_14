The other issue is that change is not necessarily new or good for the organisation.  Decision making by senior management was difficult to understand and while pressure was put on staff to perform at ever greater levels for same or reduced terms a huge number of major projects clearly wasted Council budgets.  The organisation preached investing in people but systematically dismantled teams, locations, function (libraries is one example) only for a few years later for someone to propose a 180 change, and present this as new and progressive.
