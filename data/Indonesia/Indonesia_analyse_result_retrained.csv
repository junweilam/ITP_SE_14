1. Great leadership position you can actually learn when you take a higher role 2. Great connection 3. Recognized world organization 4. Brightminded people with wrong purpose. You will understand office politics early before get into your first professional job outside AIESEC. Considered this as your learning 5. Very competitive environment and lots of challenges,0.0005470571,0.0007211574,0.9987318
"1. Timeconsuming 2. Not paid for an abundance of hardwork 3. Cliche jargons. Basically AIESEC is just a moneymachine organizations. You need money to be a member attend local conferences do volunteering 4. Too many office politics to be considered 'achieved"" you need to accomplish all targets but to be considered as ""positionfit"" you need to know who's your support system 5. There is no fixed business conduct related to the membership. You could be cut anytime if you're not your team leader favourite  My advice to everyone who wants to join: there is no wrong to join this organization but always remember your value. You needs to be respected your work needs to be recognized you need to have a support system your works need to be rewarded (for example with certicate or salary). Always her your heart if this organization is not right for you then leave you deserve a better place. If you still a member who is struggling (love the environment but hate the people) thats ok if you think that you still need a learning just go for it but always remember that you need to be awarded in the end by earning a certficate and salary not just a personal development form a cliche jargon",0.99658406,0.003216796,0.00019911549

The mission was challenging and worth engaging with.  Many were inspired to work well beyond hours and time to achieve goals.  People in the organisation were very good to work with and many became and remain great friends.  Of even more importance was the opportunity to work with those from other cultures and experiences.  Sharing progress with these people was important and there were many successes.,0.0014812805,0.019953623,0.97856504
The main problem was the endless cycle of planning with the Council.  Each planning cycle was presented as the next best thing and dictates that all should engage and welcome change but change for change sake is not productive.  The other issue is that change is not necessarily new or good for the organisation.  Decision making by senior management was difficult to understand and while pressure was put on staff to perform at ever greater levels for same or reduced terms a huge number of major projects clearly wasted Council budgets.  The organisation preached investing in people but systematically dismantled teams locations function (libraries is one example) only for a few years later for someone to propose a 180 change and present this as new and progressive.  Ultimately frustrating; some people and departments were treated very badly.,0.99782014,0.0019907292,0.00018914504

1. A TERRIBLE HORRIBLE CEO 2. There's no upper management in this organization it mainly run by a one and only dicator Carolena Sasaki 3. The only and biggest problem is micromanagement from the CEO herself. She called the center every single day texted us on midnight called us on our days off even if she knew exactly that we had our days off. She has this sort of control management issues. My mental health was deteriorating when I was working with Carol. I cried every single day. She manipulated me into thinking that I did my job wrong. She gaslighted me. I was burned out because I had to manage a center with an unreasonable amount of work without getting paid. It took me months to heal from this trauma. I just wish whoever applying to this organization don't have to experience what I experienced. But the best advice you can get for me is RUN while you have the chance.

I started to work for IHF as an At Home Volunteer but I faced the real challenges when I joined the IHF Center. This structure is run by 100% of volunteers and this is what I admire a lot. 100% of donations are given to the benefeciaries. You will learn a lot and more you have responsability more you are confident and more you feel that you learn a lot in a short time. Everyday we should keep in mind one thing : Why we are working for IHF ? And when you start to think about the children you start to feel that you are overwhelmed by a motivation to push your limits. I give my contribution my help to IHF because this structure deserves it more than any other ngo.  Personnally when I see that a child is not yet sponsored I can't let things like my duty is to do my maximum to sponsor as much children as we can to fight against this ignorance which leads to unfair situations. Join IHF you will learn not only a lot about yourself but also about how we run an NGO in whatever aspects. This is interesting when you have on you a humanitarian spirit and you want to organize it and develop it more.,0.18545884,0.792546,0.021995151

Allows flexibility for immersion direct contact with locals/children and a chance to make a substantial difference if your aspirations are to do so. The stipend allows for some flexibility as long as you bring some of your own investment. The network you can build both with community and with the more experienced Directors and volunteers has longevity.   Donations reach the children 100% and that is a big focus in the Foundation and a credit to management for reducing the admin trails that usually deduct from donations.    The children and local community are a gift that can not be quantified: they make it ALL WORTH IT  every penny bead of sweat and hard work invested!,0.0011831641,0.00087370264,0.9979431

IHF gives you the opportunity to help in the most wonderful environtment surrounded by wonderful people and amazing children. Althought it is intended you to teach the children most of the tiemes they are the ones to teach you something about their culture their country...even about yourself. My time in Bali Centre it was incredible and Gina Centre manager is a very caring person who is always there to support you.

By joining this team I learnt how to handle an education center where 200 kids from the nearby slum areas come to study every week for free. I helped to link them with international sponsors so the poorest could continue attending local schools. I organised fundraisings events for the kids campaigns. I learnt everything on the field. Additionally I also got a good understanding of the functioning of a NGOs at the administrative level too by handling the HR team for example. This is often a part that is forgotten but every international NGO needs them to exist!  I challenged myself I discovered a new country Indonesia and its amazing culture I made new friends that I miss dearly and with whom I still chat regularly. This experience changed me and I am very thankful for all that I have learnt at IHF.,0.0012521418,0.010614326,0.9881335
Yes working at an IHF center is hard but you don't join the team to go on a vacation! Some people tend to forget that because of the places we live in Indonesia Kenya Thailand. This job is definitely not for slackers or people who like to stay in their comfort zone. Be ready to give everything but don't worry you will get much more back.  Some tasks might be a bit repetitive but it's part of a normal job and if you know how important they are for the functioning of the organisation it becomes essential to you too. There is room for improvement but I always felt that my direct manager was very welcoming of new ideas to change the system for the better.  The PDG is definitely special but she is not involved in daily decisions anymore and you can learn how to handle her another exercise to improve your diplomacy skills. Moreover based on my experiences with NGOs you have to understand that many people who dedicate their lives to the benefit of others often struggle with personal issues.,0.91806334,0.08126449,0.0006722275

"I have never in my entire life EVER seen and personally experienced such rudeness lack of basic respect and incompetency by management. More specifically from the CEO or rather the founder now as she likes to be called nowadays as she has retired only by name. Let's just say one mess led to another and she is now more active in all aspects of the organization than ever before. She runs the organization like a crazed and disillusioned dictator. You will be micromanaged berated and there will be no regard for your opinion much less general wellbeing. When I look back at my experience and remember the things done to my coworkers and I the more outraged and simply appalled I am by the sheer stupidity arrogance and callousness of this woman who may once been a nice person but is now far so far from it. Why does this post seem to be so personal? Because Carol will try to dictate and control both your work and PERSONAL life while you work for her. You are seen as property or a ""resource"" which is a nicer word they use from time to time. Not a human being who can or will suffer human consequences for the honestly terrible decisions they make which is usually based on emotion and no logic. Before you even consider joining this truly toxic organization ask the people hiring you one question: is Carol Sasaki involved in any way with the organization and will I have to interact with her? If the answers are both yeses run. For the sake of your mental and physical health do not join. It's not worth the stress frustration and anger for the volunteer pay you receive and the minimal impact you have on the children's lives. In such a poorlyrun organization it's hardly possible for you to make a true long term impact. Respect the children enough to realize that they aren't fragile flowers that are withering away and the ways IHF tries to help them is of poor quality. In truth based on Carol's decisions it has become apparent that she does not care about the children and communities she claims to serve. Its about her. Her ego and her ""legacy"". So please do yourself and those that care about you a favor and abort all thoughts of joining this mad dictatorship.",0.9982108,0.001609669,0.00017959722
