After classes, we have a lot of free time and we can do as we wish. It also has the common benefits of working in educational institutes. Also, it provides lunch money, normally 12 or so days of paid leave, and health insurance", "cons": "Low pay for beginners and long time for increment: The company offers a low starting salary for beginners, which is significantly lower than the industry standard. Additionally, the time it takes to receive a salary increment is unreasonably long, causing many employees to feel undervalued and demotivated. The company's unwillingness to offer fair compensation creates a significant obstacle to attracting and retaining top talent, which ultimately harms the company's growth and profitability. Lack of respect for employees: Many employees feel that they are not treated with the respect they deserve. They feel undervalued and unappreciated by management and often feel like their contributions to the company are ignored. This lack of respect can lead to low morale, decreased productivity, and high employee turnover rates. Perception that employees are treated as slaves: There is a prevalent perception among employees that the company views them as disposable assets rather than valuable contributors. This perception is fueled by the company's refusal to offer fair compensation, long work hours, and a lack of respect for employees' opinions and concerns. This kind of attitude can lead to a toxic work environment and a high rate of employee dissatisfaction. Job description not being followed: Employees are often assigned duties that are not part of their job descriptions. This can cause frustration and burnout, as employees are not adequately trained or compensated for these additional responsibilities. The company's disregard for job descriptions also leads to confusion and a lack of clarity regarding employees' roles and responsibilities. Lack of proper leadership: Many employees feel that there is a lack of proper leadership within the company. They feel that their bosses are ineffective and offer little to no guidance or support. This lack of leadership can lead to a lack of direction, unclear expectations, and low morale among employees. Lack of recognition for work done: Employees feel that their hard work and contributions go unrecognized by management. There is a lack of incentives or rewards for good performance, which can lead to low morale and decreased motivation among employees. This lack of recognition can also lead to a high rate of employee turnover, as employees feel undervalued and unappreciated. Working for a sister company with no benefits or credit: Many employees are frustrated by the fact that they are often assigned to work for a sister company without receiving any benefits or credit for their work. This can cause resentment among employees and a feeling of being exploited by the company. Problematic corporate culture with a focus on quantity over quality: The company's focus on bringing in more students rather than improving the quality of education is problematic. This can lead to a lack of investment in training, development, and resources, which ultimately harms the students' education quality. Additionally, the emphasis on quantity over quality can lead to a high rate of employee burnout, as employees are often overworked and undervalued. Unfair pay for teachers compared to janitors: The company pays teachers less than it pays janitors, which is unfair and demoralizing for teachers. This pay disparity sends a message that teaching is not valued or respected within the company, which can lead to a high rate of turnover among teachers. Unrealistic deadlines set for work completion: Employees often face unrealistic deadlines that are difficult or impossible to meet. This can cause stress, anxiety, and burnout, as employees are constantly under pressure to meet these deadlines. Additionally, unrealistic deadlines can lead to a decrease in the quality of work produced, which ultimately harms the company's reputation and growth."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Feels like training institute rather than college", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Faculty Member in Kathmandu", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good to start the career in academic after graduation.", "cons": "Give work which are beyond the academic.
