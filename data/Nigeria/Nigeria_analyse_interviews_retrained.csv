I recently did an interview with WBG for a HRBP position. It was a 4 panel member interview. The questions are mainly competency based questions. Example describe a time you made a mistake with serious implication what was the mistake how did you manage it and what was the outcome? I will encourage anyone preparing for such interview to attend prepared. Study the JD and ensure you have two questions set for the competencies listed on the advert. One positive and one negative.,0.004221661,0.99559695,0.0001814278

It was not too tense. The applicant needs to be extraprepared and composes foe the job. Knowledge of the organization's operation is equally imperative. Thus an hour dedication to Fhi360 website would do.,0.000799039,0.99861455,0.0005863717
Hiring was a bit slow and interviews kept being repeated. A telephone interview followed a face to face interview and they weren't readily forthcoming with post interview feedback. On the flipside once they had taken a decision the rest of the process was quite speedily smooth.,0.96478593,0.034965545,0.00024854773

There was definitely use of some scare tactics but overall not too bad. Just be confident with yourself. Multiple people in the room questions all related to the job experience. If you say you know how to do something make sure you are certain they will ask.,0.0006518578,0.99869686,0.0006513374
It was quite interesting the process was different from the usual interviews by employers. All in all the stages are about five including a 6hour test to be taken at your convenience.,0.0010617251,0.9766311,0.022307122
Applied online and received an invitation for an online case study test. The test covered areas such as personnel management cultural diversity financial modelling and analytic thinking.

The process was easy especially if you are an experienced candidate. Most of the questions they ask you are related to the role you applied for. there are about 23 interviews before they give you the job.,0.0026970655,0.9769495,0.020353487
I would love to be as detailed as I possibly can hoping that my experience helps someone out there.  My interview started with an aptitude test (by plum.io) after which I got invited for a 1hour phone interview with a recruiter in Kenya. A week later I was sent an exercise and asked to submit within 24 hours.  Finally a week later I was called for another phone interview then after that I was told I didn't qualify for the next round of the interview.,0.9917787,0.00810621,0.00011501541
The interview process was good. I had two telephone interviews and one written exercise where i was asked to manage a work scenario similar to what the role demanded. I responded by focusing on the methodology of getting the right data but i guess the interviewer was more interested in me naming actual solutions. So if you are interviewing for a role and they ask you to name solutions please name specific solutions.,0.0005964285,0.99842274,0.0009807979
I only participated in the plum survey and after a week I was informed that I was not selected for the next phase of the interview. But I still learnt some things from the result of the plum survey because I now know some of my weak points that are needing improvement.,0.013625727,0.9861562,0.0002180763
I applied for the Strategy & Operations Analyst role in Rwanda. Shortly afterwards I was sent an email saying that although I met the qualifications it'd be better if I continued the interview for the Program Associate role Nigeria.  I decided to continue and had to complete a 'Plum survey' which is quite similar to an MBTI (though it tries to simulate ones potential behavior in a real work context). Afterward taking the 'plum survey' I was asked to pick a date for the first of two (2) overthephone interviews (on Skype). I selected a date and started to prepare for common interview questions I found on Glassdoor (whichI must say are very accurate!).  I noticed that there was usually a question requesting 2 instances where one has displayed LEADERSHIP and a brain teaser. So I developed my stories and also prepared for other typical interview questions.  My interview lasted for about 1 hour 20 mins (after answering a mix of personal professional and one case question; plusmy own questions on OAF).  After  two (2) days I was informed that my application was not selected to proceed to the next stage (another phone interview with perhaps another member of OAF).   Overall they were quite engaging until the actual interview where I felt my interviewer could have done a better job communicating her expectations and giving feedback at the end of the interview.,0.43018892,0.56931764,0.00049346674
I received an email requesting for a convenient time for a Skype Interview. I missed the first date due to connection issues and so it was rescheduled for the following week.  the interviewer was quite pleasant but you couldn't really tell if your responses were right or wrong.  She sounded impressed with everything which I must confess was quite misleading.,0.06934716,0.9299281,0.0007247562
