As mentioned by many above DRC has grown very quickly and its systems and procedures have not caught up.  There is no shared vision or any sense even that such a thing is helpful.  The subsequent organisational drift is compounded by the gap in their espoused values and their actual ones.  During my time focusing on staff welfare our research showed that the biggest stressors for staff may of whom had fled conflicts came not from the external environment but from DRC itself!    Poor communication and coordination temporary contracts staff often working long hours without contracts or adequate resources or time for training or teambuilding results in an a stressful blame culture.  And I have seen these same patterns in different DRC country offices. Head office are on another planet.  Their approach is target based mechanistic and occasionally addresses real needs.  Often because of poor participation and the culture of frenetic busyness their programs have questionable impacts and this confusion often sabotages the very goals they want to reach!  If they were a private company in the market they would have no customers and would've been shut down years ago!!,0.9988392,0.0010180796,0.00014278281
