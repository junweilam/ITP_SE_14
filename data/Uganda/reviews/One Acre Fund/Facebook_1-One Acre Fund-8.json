I love working here because of the impact we have, and it makes all the cons below worth it. Top it off with a deep investment in professional development by managers, flexible working environment, and being surrounded by staffers who as mission-oriented as you are, and you end up with a great place to work. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot of noise about headline salaries being low, but it's worth remembering that 1) cost of living, if you're smart about it, is quite low and 2) there are a LOT of benefits, stipends, and reimbursements that end up increasing your overall salary. I've been able to save quite a bit while living in Uganda.", "cons": "One Acre is belatedly investing in tech and back-end systems, but the support for in-country employees is quite low. I don't mean support for things like housing or travel--that stuff is well taken care of--but things like managing immigration or taxes, our budgeting reporting systems, or tech for the field team are creaky and broken. It reflects the fact that we have not elegantly outgrown our initial startup culture, nor have we been willing/able to make the big investments in professionalizing our HR/Tech/Finance systems. \r\n\r\nLike I said above, these do not detract from the overall experience here, and I would fully recommend working at 1AF. This review should only warn people that they'll need to take a more proactive approach to 'bureaucratic' things; if you're coming from a more well-oiled or well-established company you might be surprised."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Awesome!", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Operations Manager in Jinja, Jinja", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "All-inclusive model to improve on the plight of smallholder farmers.", "cons": "Centralised decision-making system, bringing about a lot of bureaucracy."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Program Associate", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Program Associate in Kampala", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting work for those interested in global development, great benefits (eg 2 flights per year, housing and other stipends)", "cons": "Low salaries, difficult to navigate career development opportunities, tough work in very challenging work environment - definitely not everybody's cup of tea"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 May 2020", "job_title": "Internship in Jinja, Jinja", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great Manager and Experienced people to learn from", "cons": "- Heavy workload and slim work-life balance"}], []]
