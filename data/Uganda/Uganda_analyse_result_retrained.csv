I love working here because of the impact we have and it makes all the cons below worth it. Top it off with a deep investment in professional development by managers flexible working environment and being surrounded by staffers who as missionoriented as you are and you end up with a great place to work.   There's a lot of noise about headline salaries being low but it's worth remembering that 1) cost of living if you're smart about it is quite low and 2) there are a LOT of benefits stipends and reimbursements that end up increasing your overall salary.

One Acre is belatedly investing in tech and backend systems but the support for incountry employees is quite low. I don't mean support for things like housing or travelthat stuff is well taken care ofbut things like managing immigration or taxes our budgeting reporting systems or tech for the field team are creaky and broken. It reflects the fact that we have not elegantly outgrown our initial startup culture nor have we been willing/able to make the big investments in professionalizing our HR/Tech/Finance systems.   Like I said above these do not detract from the overall experience here and I would fully recommend working at 1AF. This review should only warn people that they'll need to take a more proactive approach to 'bureaucratic' things; if you're coming from a more welloiled or wellestablished company you might be surprised.,0.9917269,0.008024182,0.0002489561

Mountains upon mountains of paperwork for even the smallest action and decision. 50  70 % of EVERYONE'S time is spent writing memos (famously called NFRs) reports memos to explain why another memo is required. Any kind of paper work you could imagine? WFP has it and has a report and manual about it. And this is just for basic work actions like ordering supplies requesting travel organising a meeting or workshop. Should you actually wish to innovate or change a process...Good luck.
