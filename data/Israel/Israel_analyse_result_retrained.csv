Hebrew can be an obstacle if nonspoken although English is spoken by all employees staff and students. Salaries for TAs differs variably and should be carefully negotiated. International programs are fairly more expensive than regular tuition. Not all research professors are necessarily good teachers lecturers. HU does not directly employ its janitors but rather pays a external company which employs them thus prevent them from regular employee benefits. TAs don't get hires for the entire fo their research periods but actually get rehired each 6 months as university sees fit.,0.9983461,0.0015055351,0.00014842974
