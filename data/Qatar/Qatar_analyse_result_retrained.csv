Gladly I increased my publication portfolio and my direct colleagues were very pleasant. I also enjoyed the multicultural atmosphere of WCMQ and Doha very much.,0.0001754425,0.0010416632,0.99878293
I was working at WCMQ for more than one year and was laid off recently (despite a good performance evaluation) together with many other employees due to the financial problems of the State of Qatar and Qatar Foundation (QF). All in all while I can understand the necessities coming from financial pressure I’m critical about the college’s environment and its priorities that accompanied the layoff of many decent researchers.  WCMQ’s reputation (OK mostly from its mother organization Weill Cornell Medicine in New York) together with its bolstered salaries in Qatar are tempting. The college also sugarcoats your stay by providing free luxurious accommodation businessclass flights and many allowances. It’s like the institution doesn’t trust its own standing. And in rougher times this weakness strikes back.  Moreover the college is or was until recently big in assigning people to many peripheral tasks. Well but a college is about teaching and research not about nourishing an administrative or political waterhead. I didn’t get the impression this head was chopped off first as deans for this and deans for that were appointed until late winter 2016 before a hiring stop came.  Aside from the hireandfire environment fueled by budgetary nearsightedness and wrong priorities there are too many administrative people down to the PA level who think they are actually in charge of the the researchers’ business as many of them have been at the college for long time.
