The college also sugar-coats your stay by providing free luxurious accommodation, business-class flights, and many allowances. It\u2019s like the institution doesn\u2019t trust its own standing. And in rougher times, this weakness strikes back.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the college is, or was until recently, big in assigning people to many peripheral tasks. Well, but a college is about teaching and research, not about nourishing an administrative or political water-head. I didn\u2019t get the impression this head was chopped off first as deans for this and deans for that were appointed until late winter 2016 before a hiring stop came.\r\n\r\nAside from the hire-and-fire environment fueled by budgetary nearsightedness and wrong priorities, there are too many administrative people, down to the PA level, who think they are actually in charge of the the researchers\u2019 business as many of them have been at the college for long time.
