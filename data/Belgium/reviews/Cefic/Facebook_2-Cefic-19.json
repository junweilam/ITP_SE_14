All previous reviews were correct for the situation several years ago but the organisation has done a really impressive transformation under the most recent leadership over the past 3-4 years. More young and dynamic people were hired, better management processes developed, the organisation has become more efficient in advocacy and communications both externally and towards membership. Granted, there are still issues and the situation can vary from department to department: some are modern, dynamic and try to be on the edge, some are still managed by dinosaurs. Good work-life balance, employees are really taken care of.", "cons": "Upward mobility is difficult but this is the case for all trade associations.
