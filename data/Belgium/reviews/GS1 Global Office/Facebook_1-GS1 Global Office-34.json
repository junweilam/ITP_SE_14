This place is a career killer. \r\n- Great place to end your career: because stress and the general lack of any normalcy will eventually kill you.\r\n- Leadership style and culture straight out of the 80s and the company hasn't evolved in decades. \r\n- Company is rife with inside politics at every layer and the few people of note hold all the power, traveling all over the world in business class fare attending superfluous meetings. \r\n- Leadership lacks vision and execution and nothing of note has been achieved in years. \r\n- The company is run like a dictatorship, and the churn at the leadership level is mind boggling.\r\n- Incompetent people managers and a non existent and dysfunctional HR has created a perfect storm for abuse and harassment.  \r\n-  Promotions are non-existent. Performance / Exceptional abilities does not get you a promotion at this place.\r\n- Benefits package is very poor for a non-profit organization. Non-profits have no profit sharing plans / ESOPs, however they do have excellent benefits and perks. This place has neither.\r\n\r\nMy advice \u2026 stay away and work for an actual for profit / product company that makes a real difference in this world."}], []]
