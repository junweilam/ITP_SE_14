Interesting industry to work in complex policy challenges to deal with nice and supportive atmosphere in the office great location benefits and perks opportunities for professional developments (but rather horizontally than vertically). All previous reviews were correct for the situation several years ago but the organisation has done a really impressive transformation under the most recent leadership over the past 34 years. More young and dynamic people were hired better management processes developed the organisation has become more efficient in advocacy and communications both externally and towards membership. Granted there are still issues and the situation can vary from department to department: some are modern dynamic and try to be on the edge some are still managed by dinosaurs. Good worklife balance employees are really taken care of.,0.000527026,0.0028033417,0.9966697

 Great place to end your career: if you are the kind who wants to ride into the sunset and really do not care about what you do.  Great place to end your career: if you are young ambitious and stupid enough to think you can make a difference or enhance your career here or that the company cares about you. This place is a career killer.   Great place to end your career: because stress and the general lack of any normalcy will eventually kill you.  Leadership style and culture straight out of the 80s and the company hasn't evolved in decades.   Company is rife with inside politics at every layer and the few people of note hold all the power traveling all over the world in business class fare attending superfluous meetings.   Leadership lacks vision and execution and nothing of note has been achieved in years.   The company is run like a dictatorship and the churn at the leadership level is mind boggling.  Incompetent people managers and a non existent and dysfunctional HR has created a perfect storm for abuse and harassment.     Promotions are nonexistent. Performance / Exceptional abilities does not get you a promotion at this place.  Benefits package is very poor for a nonprofit organization. Nonprofits have no profit sharing plans / ESOPs however they do have excellent benefits and perks. This place has neither.

Staff come and go quite quickly and anyone who survives for more than two years is rare. New staff are talented and enthusiastic at first but gradually become disillusioned and leave  often not by choice creating a truly toxic work environment as people you respect leave in questionable circumstances. Those left behind wonder when their time will come mostly without any warning creating an uncomfortable environment.  Management and HR can and should better manage talent with transparency in all departments and actively discourage cliques and the tyranny of a few. People are currently judged not on the quality of their work but on who likes (or doesn't) like them. Put in fair and transparent guidelines as well as a system for promotions (rather than relying on department heads HR should design a career path).   Anyone considering taking a position here should read these reviews carefully and aim for other options.,0.99425924,0.005394091,0.0003467202

" Working with other researchers that often are teachers makes you work with experts who sometimes have little regards for your current knowledge or thirst to learn (of course it heavily depends on the person concerned). Actually competition is fierce and not every researcher likes his/her neighbor.   Sometimes working as a researcher means you are working on your own. After a while you lack of ""classical work communications with colleagues"" that you may find in other companies.   Working as a researcher is good but if feels like you are still a student somehow.

It's an academic environment but with a business edge; for people so inclined it presents a nice balance. Among the researchers and more junior people there is a good culture and some of the senior people and professors are very open to mentorship.,0.0006230754,0.029683622,0.96969324
As a business school one would expect Vlerick to apply what it teaches particularly in regards to people management. Nonetheless the evaluation promotion and compensation systems are very weak and intransparent. Futhermore the most senior management completely ignores the juniors barely even saying hello when they pass in the corridors.,0.9986265,0.0012402213,0.00013327677

Mostly related to the policy on research:  focus on research being profitable (rather than a cost)  drain of these past years without replacement has left Vlerick without experienced researchers  PhDs are not kept around contributing to the loss of experience  no slack given for writing proposals yet it is expected to be funded for 150% of your time  no slack given or guidance giving for writing highend publications yet A publications are expected  professors are so overloaded with teaching that research is dropped  Other points:  heavy favouritism (business over research some people over others)  research is an investment a cost. not a profit post  worklife balance,0.9989697,0.0008764668,0.00015386762
