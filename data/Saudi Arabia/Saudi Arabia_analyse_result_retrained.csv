The college's vision like many others appears on its face to have value and merit. However BSC has done minimal preplanning to operate a complicated training academy outside of the USA. The pay is average but complications for employees exist that include not having a work visa issuing vastly different employment contracts for the identical faculty positions. This has caused confusion and any redress issues are not being handled at all. BSC already has a few active labor cases in the Kingdom.,0.99842596,0.001437365,0.00013672734
The absence of a sound operational infrastructure has created chaos and at times a hostile work environment. For example there's no academic platform no curriculum syllabus lesson plans pacing schedule or examination protocols. This has created academic dishonesty events and does not comply with BSC's contract. There is no employee handbook no P&P's no job descriptions no professional development. The college's LLC is not fully operational at this time so payroll issues visas for spouses and others exist.,0.9990858,0.00076309516,0.0001511159

Teachers have no say in how things are run. All rules and policies are made by upper Saudi management. We don't even know who they are. Even the Academic Director has no say. Teachers are distrusted and tightly controlled. There is deep suspicion of teachers and we all can sense this. It is a very demoralizing place to work. Also the classes are huge and the paperwork is tremendous. There is mountains of paperwork each week. If you do not submit it you are in danger of being dismissed. There are many backup Saudi ESL teachers available so PNU is not worried about losing teachers. (The Saudi ESL teachers are quite good and pleasant; they are parttime for now.)

I was shocked when I came to PNU because it is so different from all the hype.  In reading the reviews I realize I'm not alone.    Huge classes and hours of paperwork. Too much work to take home.  No real teaching and no book. The materials are awful and embarrassing to teach.    Students talk constantly and won't stop. You cannot discipline them or you will get a warning. You spend class time teaching the tests and telling students to be quiet. If a student complains the teacher will get a warning.   Saudis teachers have small classes and leave at 1:30. Foreign teachers have huge classes and stay till 4:30. Sometimes foreign teachers are forced to work 9hour days but don't get overtime.    Bizarre teaching environment! Teachers are insecure and antisocial. They get jealous about everything. They openly snicker and insult each other at meetings. They stare at you and roll their eyes. We are forced to share materials but never a thank you and only criticism.   No health insurance and no sick leave! Government clinics won't take foreigners but PNU still won't provide health insurance. There is no sick leave because PNU doesn't give foreigners sick leave referrals. It is their policy. No matter what you must work or not get paid. You also pay for your own health care and taxi fare. Being out sick one day will cost you a day's salary and then some!,0.9989237,0.00091617485,0.00016006001

Be very careful before you accept a contract to work at Princess Nora University. After you have been here for some time they will cut your salary by 2550%. They will do this two weeks before the end of the year so that you cannot do anything about it.  PNU also does not pay health insurance or iqama fees. They do this to all teachers so you will not be the only one. Still it is a frustrating thing to happen. Also they do it in a legal way so you cannot fight it.  There are also many other problems with PNU. Too many to talk about and teachers always leave with a bad feeling from here. It is a very unhealthy place to work and no one cares about you unfortunately.

Don't believe the PNU employment ads pure rubbish.   No time to take a breath. Constant meetings and PDs grading constant office hours with streams of students and more paperwork than the Pentagon. If you make any mistakes you will be called to the floor and humiliated.   If you are sick it's out of your own pocket  both the treatment and your pay for that day. PNU doesn't accept teachers being sick for common ailments like flu fever cold etc. Sounds unbelievable but this is official PNU medical leave policy and can be confirmed at A4. There is also no health insurance so you pay for your own treatment at a hospital.  If you are willing to work at 100 percent every single day from day 1 and never make a mistake then by all means come to PNU.

"PNU is the worst job I have had in 20 years and I've been everywhere. Saudi management is absent and that's the best part. The western management overloads teachers with work and paperwork then insults teachers when it's not been finished. Management speaks to us as though we are delinquent children while at the same time asking us to be professional and insisting that they are as well.  I've forgotten what professionalism means and haven't seen it a single day that I've been at this place.   The paperwork is just a horrific nightmare. To handle all the paperwork western management have hired more lead ""teachers"". I don't know why they're called lead teachers as none of these people teach a single hour of class to be sure. What do these extra lead ""teachers"" do then? They sit at their computers supervising teachers' paperwork completion. What about hiring people to help teachers with all this paperwork? Doesn't arise because teachers receive zero consideration and HAVE NO VOICE.   To be sure if I make it to June I will buy myself a kilo of chocolates and a diamond ring to celebrate the end of this nightmare.",0.9984428,0.0013551505,0.00020201282

Before signing my contract l looked at reviews of PNU on Glassdoor and concluded that so many negative reviews must be because 'only people with something negative to say generally leave reviews'. It was a disasterous assumption.  My experience here has been overwhelmingly negative. Work load is extreme. Administration is a huge part of this work load. There is zero admin support. There is an expectation that you will work every evening and weekends. Deadlines are very tight and shift all the time. I was told explicitly by the head of department that l am not allowed to say 'no' to anything. I tried it she was right you aren't allowed!  Management have adopted a very negative and bullying approach to staff management which came as a shock. I have never experienced so much despondency and genuine depression amongst colleagues accross many different departments. So many are leaving or wanting to leave. I am one if them. I came here filled with enthusiasm and expected to stay a minimum of 3 years. I've lasted one academic year (a whole year by the way with no holidays and no sick leave allowed.

You won't get what your contract promises except for  your ticket (and even then they cause problems and don't want to pay the full trip!). PNU will not give you what they say in your contract and on top of that they'll add stuff for you to do that's above and beyond what you're required to do. And then if you complain or refuse they'll threaten you with disciplinary action and send you threatening emails. Honestly they just don't see the foreigners as human beings just as unlimited robot labor to do all their work for them just like how they see their maids. They also have a problem paying the employees and try to get out of paying the full salary (which will get cut anyway once you're here for awhile),0.99906677,0.0007747641,0.00015854671

If you can work miracles with your mouth shut tight and your hands tied behind your back then you'll do fine at PNU.   Deans and lead teachers pile on work without asking teachers for feedback. Deans make ridiculous requests every few days. For example most teachers teach 6070 students at a time for 12 period sessions. Deans force EVERY STUDENT to sign the attendance sheet for EVERY SINGLE CLASS. This is really distracting and takes up  too much time. Leaves no time for teaching!

Students are arrogant and lazy. This means you assign classwork and homework and they won't do it. You try to teach them but they won't respond. They are addicted to their phones and can't be off them for more than 5 minutes. They are either checking their makeup using their phones or chatting with their friends. They never bring books notebooks or even a pencil to class. But their little bags are full of phones tablets and makeup.  They don't give foreign teachers the time of day. They talk when you're trying to lecture and get upset when you make them stop. They cheat on quizzes and tests and copy homework off each other. Look up the research you will find that saudi students are notorious around the world for plagiarising and its an epidemic in their country. The girls have ZERO critical thinking skills and can barely do the most basic tasks. If you try to make them work hard they resist and some even complain.   Saudi students are extremely spoiled. Saudi teachers just lecture while the students sit there inert. If you try to do something different they will resent you. They are polite if you leave them alone but don't try to get them to do anything that requires thinking or lifting a pencil. They are only at school to socialize.   Also as a side note if you are an asian or middle eastern western teacher you should know that these teachers are paid less than european and african origin western teachers. We realized this when we started comparing salaries this past year. You will be paid 15002000 less per month. You are also treated a little differently by the saudi staff.  Unfortunate but true and one feels bad but you should be prepared.,0.9987225,0.0011236512,0.00015376297
I live on campus so it's convenient to live nearby.  Despite having to wear the abaya on campus the grounds are attractive and lots of places to walk.  Despite the gym not being free anymore (and the bad hours of operation  it's never open in the mornings) it's not crowded so you can use the facilities easily.  So far we still get summer pay. And hopefully we still get endofcontract bonuses ... (I don't know yet since I still work here). The Saudi staff are usually good to work with (despite the fact they are slow and sometimes have low work ethic). They are building themselves up for Saudization so things are getting better slowly (with getting things done being polite relaxed helpful etc).

"After four years of working here as a direct hire they've TAKEN AWAY  the following in near order:  class A health insurance (now no insurance because there is a parttime ""hospital"" on campus  it's not good enough!) free gym (now we pay around 2000 sar per year and the gym has bad hours) took away multientry visas (now only singles) we must now pay our own iqama fees when before they would reimburse us after the first year of me being here they demanded an apartment deposit of about 2000 sar) they also said they'll take out utility costs from our salaries each month no more free daily bus rides to the supermarket the salaries have been late after summer breaks by a few months and this past year they reduced salaries due to ""economic reasons."" What next? Oh and I must mention that I will never forget the ""welcome"" I received ... trying to find the driver who was to pick me up from the airport had a ""sign"" written in pencil (no one can read this is in a crowded airport  come on!) and when I got to the apartment it was steaming hot in the dead of August with little food from a sloppy man who just basically tossed the small bag of food at me. No welcome from any of the ladies. No direction of where to go for more substantial food or water! Very disappointing ... and difficult.  Also far from city center.  Some believe it's uncomfortable living on campus since it's not open or relaxed like a compound.  Also most of the buildings are falling apart since the university was built so quickly. I really believe there is some male figure in finance who is making things difficult for the people who work at PNU and is slowly ""running PNU into the ground."" It's ruining PNU's PR for sure. EDIT :  Just announced  After posting this I found out we do NOT get paid vacations (during the academic year) anymore which includes breaks between semesters (not sure of the Ramadan break yet) but we apparently still get paid for summers.

I cannot recommend this workplace for either qualified or unqualified instructors. There are Saudi managers who are organized smart sensible and considerate; and who can cultivate a workplace ethos which is productive and free from mental distress and emotional trauma. They don't work at PNU. I've reviewed all of my previous employers reviews on glassdoor: viewers are often being accurate and fair so less than two out of five stars for the world's largest femaleonly university is unfortunately accurate and fair.,0.9971951,0.0025065274,0.00029843257
"Read prior reviews for specific details many of which I am willing to confirm having worked there for years. I observed lots of frivolous firings and warnings during my time there. In a few cases and usually in the first few months in the country teachers are at fault due to lack of cultural awareness but the bigger impossibletohide problem is consistent abuse of staff which has gotten worse.   I want to talk about root of this problem. Most abusers come from abusive homes and in this case a culture that accepts abuse and misconduct out of senior management. Many abusers even with the best support and retraining are highly likely to become repeat offenders. The best solution for the problem is to take away an abuser's access to their favored target: anyone who seems weak enough to tolerate it. In other words lock them up with fellow abusers instead of allowing them the freedom to continue terrorizing their victims.  Edited to add: Here some examples of what you might witness or be subjected to if you accept an offer to work for PNU:  Arson. There were a half dozen fires deliberately started on the old campus. Arson is a felony in most countries but because Saudis aren't willing to hold their little angels accountable for felonies the crime scenes were not treated as crime scenes and were covered up and blamed on faulty wiring and the janitors.  Filth. The new campus is enormous and frequently filthy because the girls trash the classrooms bathrooms restaurants libraries and hallways without regard for other living breathing beings. Sometimes students crap next to the toilet and don't flush. The janitors are mostly recruited from Pacific Rim countries and make about 500 riyals per month. They are taken off their compound for shopping trips to get fresh fruits and vegetables only once a month. Be kind and give them a bag of fresh fruits and vegetables every so often.  Lots of situational homosexuality and homoerotic behavior amongst the students. Some students are really excited to see each other every day. In most countries where they greet by kissing on the cheek one or two smooches will suffice but not at PNU. There are female students who dress act and speak like males. Perhaps they view being female and Saudi as a weakness and they would rather be boys. Some 'boyat' students have girlfriends on the campus and buy them food and gifts; others have stalked sexually harassed or attacked their peers and they also tend to act like they're the boss in the classroom.  Prostitution recruitment. Sexually active students have tried to recruit other students advertising that their customers will buy them a handbag perfume or give them money in return for sex. Extremism. The students are not immune to negative influences and you'll see the lack of moderation in both the students' treatment of their teachers and management's treatment of teachers though they may not feel comfortable calling it by it's proper name.   Student complaints. PNU allows students to file unsubstantiated complaints. One teacher had students who complained that her feet are ugly and was called in to hear this from her lead teacher. Students in another class told an ethnically Pakistani Western teacher that her people (Pakistanis) are the maids in Saudi Arabia and that teacher was removed from the classroom because it might be upsetting for those students to be taught by someone they look down on. Students can complain that your voice is too loud or too soft they can say anything they want and an investigation will be launched often to reveal that their real complaint is that the teacher is doing her job correctly: she's marking girls who are more than 10 minutes late absent and not letting them talk in Arabic or use their cell phone. Their goal is to get rid of the teacher in hopes of getting a new one who will dance to their tune.  No vacations. Vacations have been taken away at PNU but not at highquality accredited universities...   Observations and feedback. The criteria is periodically revised but it's never been an unbiased process.  Frivolous warnings and terminations: teachers are warned for imagined/created offenses fired for not signing the inappropriate warning fired without warning over things that were neither offensive or dangerous in some cases. Horrible absenteeism and politics. I once found a pile of blank sick leave forms from a polyclinic in an epodium drawer. Did the previous teacher forget them? Was she selling them? God knows but while other teachers are being fired or warned for wearing a sweater with a pine tree on it during the winter holiday season or for signing out two minutes early to catch the bus home (because so many other teachers are leaving early on the wrong bus that she has to leave just a little early to get the last seat on the bus that she belongs on) another teacher just stays home for two weeks with no legitimate reason and without calling in to report her absence and arrange cover for her classes. Then she buys sick leave for the days she missed and is neither warned or fired over the incident.  Borderline mental illness in students when it comes to attendance. Students are allowed up to be marked absent for 74 class hours before they're in any real danger of failing. Instead of being responsible and rationing their absences wisely they feel entitled to be absent and marked present. By effectively doing your job when they are not effectively doing theirs and marking them absent you are not respecting their sense of entitlement as a Saudi. Here are two types of situations I had to deal with more than once with my ""adult"" learners: 1. A student walks in more than 10 minutes late. She knows that by now she's been marked absent for one hour per university policy. She refuses to sit down and let the lesson continue. She argues that she's not absent because she was sick or her bus was late or she had something more important to do. You have to be polite and firm even when you tell her that her situation will not change seven times. That's one of the students who will complain later because you're being too harsh. 2. A student needs to go to the bathroom. She comes back from the bathroom over 25 minutes later to find that she got marked absent. Get ready for the same fight.   By the way most of these girls think they're going to become doctors and respected professionals when they graduate.",0.997433,0.0023430546,0.00022391274
The salary was generous tax free and on time.  Housing was relatively close to the campus so no long commute.  It was easy to do your own shopping trips independently instead of having to run with the herd all the time.  I had my own driver so I got around on my own.,0.0007977755,0.0006602392,0.99854195
"Don't be fooled by the fancy sprawling new campus with fountains and huge buildings.  The place is a jail.  Punitive oppressive work atmosphere with micromanagement by administrators taken to ridiculous and unnecessary levels as though teachers were enemies of the state.  Fear is used to keep teachers ""in line"" even outside of the classroom with useless lies about the terrible things that will befall any teacher if they go to this or that part of the city. Disrespect and distrust of teachers wreaks havoc with disciplining students who see that teachers are targets for abuse so if you personally do not establish your ""turf"" (Yes it comes down to that) being YOUR classes you will trampled and/or shot down. PNU has huge problems with retaining teachers for these reasons hence the number of jobs advertised.  Salaries are not equal with favoritism being shown to Western teachers.  So unfair.  Age bias in hiring abounds but not necessarily because of government restrictions.  Princess Noura would rather hire teachers with less experience who know nothing about the culture of Saudi Arabia and are more easily intimidated.  There is no semblance of professional development which all teachers need regardless of their level of experience or age.  There are no opportunities for professional growth or improvement.",0.99888843,0.0009529828,0.00015861989

As a foreign teacher you are a SECOND CLASS CITIZEN and you feel it EVERY SINGLE DAY. PNU’s benefits ARE NOT FOR YOU.  You’ll find some STERILE five star reviews with cut and paste style comments. These are Saudi managers and teachers who OF COURSE enjoy excellent treatment benefits and salaries. But these comments DO NOT APPLY to you. They are FOR SAUDIS ONLY  DO NOT BE FOOLED. FULLTIME SAUDI EMPLOYEES get everything – offices desks printers computers and copiers. They also get respect and they are included in everything. Even parttime Saudi teachers get more than you do. As a foreign teacher YOU GET NOTHING EXCEPT A PNU ID. You must use your OWN laptop at work (which will catch a million viruses btw) get your OWN printer and make your OWN copies on your OWN paper. They won’t even give you paper. When you ask for stuff they tell you they don’t have it or it’s not their policy to give it or later. I’ve seen Saudi teachers come after me and get everything – laser printer computer and copying privileges – frustrating and makes me really angry.  AND THAT’S JUST THE BEGINNING. Saudis get healthcare but YOU PAY FOR YOUR OWN HEALTHCARE. The contract is a BIG LIE. Saudis congregate and socialize everywhere and take selfimposed holidays but they expect you to work all the time all year as per your contract. Saudis work 56 hours a day but you have to work 8. Saudis get the small classes and choose the ones they want. Foreign teaches get the biggest classes and the WORST students. PNU hates the foreign teaches being here but they keep bringing them. THEY RESENT YOU BEING THERE.   Saudi teachers who do well are rewarded with promotions and public praise. Foreign teachers who do well are rewarded with extra work. And don’t ever ever expect a word of thanks or praise in any form. SAUDIS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REWARD OR PROMOTE FOREIGNERS. It’s against their official policy. The WORST thing? Most Saudi women EVEN THE NICE ONES treat foreign women like assistants. SAUDI WOMEN LOVE TO FEEL IMPORTANT AND THEY WILL LORD IT OVER YOU IN SMALL AND BIG WAYS. The youngest and newest Saudi teacher speaks to a foreigner like she works for the Saudi. I can’t tell you how many upstart Saudi teachers have asked me to do stuff for them and just walk away assuming I will do it. This really grates on my nerves.,0.99797565,0.0017924132,0.00023197253
Just a 10 minute walk from your office is the food fair and shopping. Just what you need some retail/food therapy after picking up your warning from your manager.  You can do a circuit fast walk around the buildings for exercise. Generally paid on time but there were some scary momentsand that was working for PNU  Direct. Teachers working for other companies are still waiting.,0.1549075,0.84413505,0.00095747627
All levels of management are abusive (there are some lovely wise humans working there though but you won't often come into contact with them) but at least this year the big director who is a horrible woman got her fair comeuppance and a big fat demotion down to teacher. Amazing how these people can't anticipate their own downfall. Was so hard not to laugh in her face. There she was down in the trenches with us after having been so horrible to so many. How's that for pie on your face. (RAOTFLMFAO!!!)    Probably the worst part of the job is the behavior of the students. Unless you are a primary school teacher you are going to have a hard time getting the students to do anything even though it's university. And some would suggest that the students are even bolder now with women's rights being given.  Management are afraid of the students as well so imagine you are firm with your girls but they just take a dislike to you and so go as a group to management to complain that you were rude to them (maybe asking them to put their mobile phones away or get their books out) and you are then called in to explain your behavior instead of management running the lying fibbers out the office while waving a stick in the air. Management are plenty tough with the teachers but lilly livered weaklings with the students.   No the worst part is that when you have PNU on your resume it hurts your chances of getting other work in the region unless you seriously hung onto your teaching skills and can seriously prove it in any other interview or demo lesson. Every other employer in the region knows that you deskill at PNU because of the behavior management issues and never really get to 'teach' anything because the students are so rude. Now if you charm your girls you may get the occasional moment in which you can teach or terrify (with exam tips) but otherwise forget it...unless you are a primary school teacher who really knows behavior management...but it's university. And we come full circle.   If you need the money desperately until your lottery win or a parent passes and you don't need to work again go for it.,0.9972778,0.0025519778,0.0001702517
