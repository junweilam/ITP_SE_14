However, BSC has done minimal preplanning to operate a complicated training academy outside of the USA. The pay is average but complications for employees exist that include not having a work visa, issuing vastly different employment contracts for the identical faculty positions. This has caused confusion and any redress issues are not being handled at all. BSC already has a few active labor cases in the Kingdom.", "cons": "The absence of a sound operational infrastructure has created chaos and at times a hostile work environment. For example, there's no academic platform, no curriculum, syllabus, lesson plans, pacing schedule or examination protocols. This has created academic dishonesty events and does not comply with BSC's contract. There is no employee handbook, no P&P's, no job descriptions, no professional development. The college's LLC is not fully operational at this time so payroll issues, visas for spouses and others exist."}], []]
