They are only at school to socialize. \r\n\r\nAlso as a side note, if you are an asian or middle eastern western teacher, you should know that these teachers are paid less than european and african origin western teachers.

They don't work at PNU. I've reviewed all of my previous employers reviews on glassdoor: viewers are often being accurate and fair, so less than two out of five stars for the world's largest female-only university is unfortunately accurate and fair.", "cons": "Read prior reviews for specific details, many of which I am willing to confirm having worked there for years. I observed lots of frivolous firings and warnings during my time there. In a few cases, and usually in the first few months in the country, teachers are at fault due to lack of cultural awareness, but the bigger, impossible-to-hide problem is consistent abuse of staff, which has gotten worse. \r\n\r\nI want to talk about root of this problem. Most abusers come from abusive homes and, in this case, a culture that accepts abuse and misconduct out of senior management. Many abusers, even with the best support and retraining, are highly likely to become repeat offenders. The best solution for the problem is to take away an abuser's access to their favored target: anyone who seems weak enough to tolerate it. In other words, lock them up with fellow abusers, instead of allowing them the freedom to continue terrorizing their victims.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: Here some examples of what you might witness or be subjected to if you accept an offer to work for PNU:\r\n\r\n-Arson. There were a half dozen fires deliberately started on the old campus. Arson is a felony in most countries, but because Saudis aren't willing to hold their little angels accountable for felonies the crime scenes were not treated as crime scenes and were covered up and blamed on faulty wiring and the janitors. \r\n-Filth. The new campus is enormous and frequently filthy because the girls trash the classrooms, bathrooms, restaurants, libraries, and hallways without regard for other living, breathing beings. Sometimes students crap next to the toilet and don't flush. The janitors are mostly recruited from Pacific Rim countries and make about 500 riyals per month. They are taken off their compound for shopping trips to get fresh fruits and vegetables only once a month. Be kind and give them a bag of fresh fruits and vegetables every so often. \r\n-Lots of situational homosexuality and homoerotic behavior amongst the students. Some students are really excited to see each other every day. In most countries where they greet by kissing on the cheek, one or two smooches will suffice, but not at PNU. There are female students who dress, act, and speak like males. Perhaps they view being female and Saudi as a weakness and they would rather be boys. Some 'boyat' students have girlfriends on the campus and buy them food and gifts; others have stalked, sexually harassed, or attacked their peers and they also tend to act like they're the boss in the classroom. \r\n-Prostitution recruitment. Sexually active students have tried to recruit other students, advertising that their customers will buy them a handbag, perfume, or give them money in return for sex.\r\n-Extremism. The students are not immune to negative influences and you'll see the lack of moderation in both the students' treatment of their teachers and management's treatment of teachers, though they may not feel comfortable calling it by it's proper name.  \r\n-Student complaints. PNU allows students to file unsubstantiated complaints. One teacher had students who complained that her feet are ugly and was called in to hear this from her lead teacher. Students in another class told an ethnically Pakistani Western teacher that her people (Pakistanis) are the maids in Saudi Arabia and that teacher was removed from the classroom because it might be upsetting for those students to be taught by someone they look down on. Students can complain that your voice is too loud or too soft, they can say anything they want and an investigation will be launched, often to reveal that their real complaint is that the teacher is doing her job correctly: she's marking girls who are more than 10 minutes late absent and not letting them talk in Arabic or use their cell phone. Their goal is to get rid of the teacher in hopes of getting a new one who will dance to their tune. \r\n-No vacations. Vacations have been taken away at PNU, but not at high-quality, accredited universities...  \r\n-Observations and feedback. The criteria is periodically revised, but it's never been an unbiased process. \r\n-Frivolous warnings and terminations: teachers are warned for imagined/created offenses, fired for not signing the inappropriate warning, fired without warning over things that were neither offensive or dangerous in some cases.\r\n-Horrible absenteeism and politics. I once found a pile of blank sick leave forms from a polyclinic in an e-podium drawer. Did the previous teacher forget them? Was she selling them? God knows, but while other teachers are being fired or warned for wearing a sweater with a pine tree on it during the winter holiday season, or for signing out two minutes early to catch the bus home (because so many other teachers are leaving early on the wrong bus that she has to leave just a little early to get the last seat on the bus that she belongs on), another teacher just stays home for two weeks with no legitimate reason and without calling in to report her absence and arrange cover for her classes. Then she buys sick leave for the days she missed and is neither warned or fired over the incident. \r\n-Borderline mental illness in students when it comes to attendance. Students are allowed up to be marked absent for 74 class hours before they're in any real danger of failing. Instead of being responsible and rationing their absences wisely, they feel entitled to be absent and marked present. By effectively doing your job when they are not effectively doing theirs and marking them absent, you are not respecting their sense of entitlement as a Saudi. Here are two types of situations I had to deal with more than once with my \"adult\" learners: 1. A student walks in more than 10 minutes late. She knows that by now she's been marked absent for one hour per university policy. She refuses to sit down and let the lesson continue. She argues that she's not absent because she was sick, or her bus was late, or she had something more important to do. You have to be polite and firm, even when you tell her that her situation will not change seven times. That's one of the students who will complain later because you're being too harsh. 2. A student needs to go to the bathroom. She comes back from the bathroom over 25 minutes later to find that she got marked absent. Get ready for the same fight. \r\n\r\nBy the way, most of these girls think they're going to become doctors and respected professionals when they graduate."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Simply Horrid", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Oct 2015", "job_title": "ESL Teacher in Riyadh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The salary was generous, tax free, and on time.

Disrespect and distrust of teachers wreaks havoc with disciplining students, who see that teachers are targets for abuse, so if you personally do not establish your \"turf\" (Yes, it comes down to that) being YOUR classes, you will trampled and/or shot down. PNU has huge problems with retaining teachers for these reasons, hence the number of jobs advertised.  Salaries are not equal, with favoritism being shown to Western teachers.  So unfair.  Age bias in hiring abounds, but not necessarily because of government restrictions.  Princess Noura would rather hire teachers with less experience who know nothing about the culture of Saudi Arabia, and are more easily intimidated.

Saudis work 5-6 hours a day, but you have to work 8. Saudis get the small classes and choose the ones they want. Foreign teaches get the biggest classes and the WORST students.

How's that for pie on your face. (RAOTFLMFAO!!!)  \r\n\r\nProbably the worst part of the job is the behavior of the students. Unless you are a primary school teacher, you are going to have a hard time getting the students to do anything, even though it's university. And some would suggest that the students are even bolder now with women's rights being given.  Management are afraid of the students as well so imagine you are firm with your girls but they just take a dislike to you and so go as a group to management to complain that you were rude to them (maybe asking them to put their mobile phones away or get their books out) and you are then called in to explain your behavior, instead of management running the lying fibbers out the office while waving a stick in the air. Management are plenty tough with the teachers but lilly livered weaklings with the students. \r\n\r\nNo, the worst part is that when you have PNU on your resume, it hurts your chances of getting other work in the region unless you seriously hung onto your teaching skills and can seriously prove it in any other interview or demo lesson. Every other employer in the region knows that you deskill at PNU because of the behavior management issues and never really get to 'teach' anything because the students are so rude. Now, if you charm your girls, you may get the occasional moment in which you can teach or terrify (with exam tips) but otherwise, forget it...unless you are a primary school teacher who really knows behavior management...but it's university.

I've reviewed all of my previous employers reviews on glassdoor: viewers are often being accurate and fair, so less than two out of five stars for the world's largest female-only university is unfortunately accurate and fair.", "cons": "Read prior reviews for specific details, many of which I am willing to confirm having worked there for years. I observed lots of frivolous firings and warnings during my time there. In a few cases, and usually in the first few months in the country, teachers are at fault due to lack of cultural awareness, but the bigger, impossible-to-hide problem is consistent abuse of staff, which has gotten worse. \r\n\r\nI want to talk about root of this problem. Most abusers come from abusive homes and, in this case, a culture that accepts abuse and misconduct out of senior management. Many abusers, even with the best support and retraining, are highly likely to become repeat offenders. The best solution for the problem is to take away an abuser's access to their favored target: anyone who seems weak enough to tolerate it. In other words, lock them up with fellow abusers, instead of allowing them the freedom to continue terrorizing their victims.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: Here some examples of what you might witness or be subjected to if you accept an offer to work for PNU:\r\n\r\n-Arson. There were a half dozen fires deliberately started on the old campus. Arson is a felony in most countries, but because Saudis aren't willing to hold their little angels accountable for felonies the crime scenes were not treated as crime scenes and were covered up and blamed on faulty wiring and the janitors. \r\n-Filth. The new campus is enormous and frequently filthy because the girls trash the classrooms, bathrooms, restaurants, libraries, and hallways without regard for other living, breathing beings. Sometimes students crap next to the toilet and don't flush. The janitors are mostly recruited from Pacific Rim countries and make about 500 riyals per month. They are taken off their compound for shopping trips to get fresh fruits and vegetables only once a month. Be kind and give them a bag of fresh fruits and vegetables every so often. \r\n-Lots of situational homosexuality and homoerotic behavior amongst the students. Some students are really excited to see each other every day. In most countries where they greet by kissing on the cheek, one or two smooches will suffice, but not at PNU. There are female students who dress, act, and speak like males. Perhaps they view being female and Saudi as a weakness and they would rather be boys. Some 'boyat' students have girlfriends on the campus and buy them food and gifts; others have stalked, sexually harassed, or attacked their peers and they also tend to act like they're the boss in the classroom. \r\n-Prostitution recruitment. Sexually active students have tried to recruit other students, advertising that their customers will buy them a handbag, perfume, or give them money in return for sex.\r\n-Extremism. The students are not immune to negative influences and you'll see the lack of moderation in both the students' treatment of their teachers and management's treatment of teachers, though they may not feel comfortable calling it by it's proper name.  \r\n-Student complaints. PNU allows students to file unsubstantiated complaints. One teacher had students who complained that her feet are ugly and was called in to hear this from her lead teacher. Students in another class told an ethnically Pakistani Western teacher that her people (Pakistanis) are the maids in Saudi Arabia and that teacher was removed from the classroom because it might be upsetting for those students to be taught by someone they look down on. Students can complain that your voice is too loud or too soft, they can say anything they want and an investigation will be launched, often to reveal that their real complaint is that the teacher is doing her job correctly: she's marking girls who are more than 10 minutes late absent and not letting them talk in Arabic or use their cell phone. Their goal is to get rid of the teacher in hopes of getting a new one who will dance to their tune. \r\n-No vacations. Vacations have been taken away at PNU, but not at high-quality, accredited universities...  \r\n-Observations and feedback. The criteria is periodically revised, but it's never been an unbiased process. \r\n-Frivolous warnings and terminations: teachers are warned for imagined/created offenses, fired for not signing the inappropriate warning, fired without warning over things that were neither offensive or dangerous in some cases.\r\n-Horrible absenteeism and politics. I once found a pile of blank sick leave forms from a polyclinic in an e-podium drawer. Did the previous teacher forget them? Was she selling them? God knows, but while other teachers are being fired or warned for wearing a sweater with a pine tree on it during the winter holiday season, or for signing out two minutes early to catch the bus home (because so many other teachers are leaving early on the wrong bus that she has to leave just a little early to get the last seat on the bus that she belongs on), another teacher just stays home for two weeks with no legitimate reason and without calling in to report her absence and arrange cover for her classes. Then she buys sick leave for the days she missed and is neither warned or fired over the incident. \r\n-Borderline mental illness in students when it comes to attendance. Students are allowed up to be marked absent for 74 class hours before they're in any real danger of failing. Instead of being responsible and rationing their absences wisely, they feel entitled to be absent and marked present. By effectively doing your job when they are not effectively doing theirs and marking them absent, you are not respecting their sense of entitlement as a Saudi. Here are two types of situations I had to deal with more than once with my \"adult\" learners: 1. A student walks in more than 10 minutes late. She knows that by now she's been marked absent for one hour per university policy. She refuses to sit down and let the lesson continue. She argues that she's not absent because she was sick, or her bus was late, or she had something more important to do. You have to be polite and firm, even when you tell her that her situation will not change seven times. That's one of the students who will complain later because you're being too harsh. 2. A student needs to go to the bathroom. She comes back from the bathroom over 25 minutes later to find that she got marked absent. Get ready for the same fight. \r\n\r\nBy the way, most of these girls think they're going to become doctors and respected professionals when they graduate."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Simply Horrid", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Oct 2015", "job_title": "ESL Teacher in Riyadh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The salary was generous, tax free, and on time.

Disrespect and distrust of teachers wreaks havoc with disciplining students, who see that teachers are targets for abuse, so if you personally do not establish your \"turf\" (Yes, it comes down to that) being YOUR classes, you will trampled and/or shot down. PNU has huge problems with retaining teachers for these reasons, hence the number of jobs advertised.  Salaries are not equal, with favoritism being shown to Western teachers.  So unfair.  Age bias in hiring abounds, but not necessarily because of government restrictions.  Princess Noura would rather hire teachers with less experience who know nothing about the culture of Saudi Arabia, and are more easily intimidated.

Saudis work 5-6 hours a day, but you have to work 8. Saudis get the small classes and choose the ones they want. Foreign teaches get the biggest classes and the WORST students.

How's that for pie on your face. (RAOTFLMFAO!!!)  \r\n\r\nProbably the worst part of the job is the behavior of the students. Unless you are a primary school teacher, you are going to have a hard time getting the students to do anything, even though it's university. And some would suggest that the students are even bolder now with women's rights being given.  Management are afraid of the students as well so imagine you are firm with your girls but they just take a dislike to you and so go as a group to management to complain that you were rude to them (maybe asking them to put their mobile phones away or get their books out) and you are then called in to explain your behavior, instead of management running the lying fibbers out the office while waving a stick in the air. Management are plenty tough with the teachers but lilly livered weaklings with the students. \r\n\r\nNo, the worst part is that when you have PNU on your resume, it hurts your chances of getting other work in the region unless you seriously hung onto your teaching skills and can seriously prove it in any other interview or demo lesson.
