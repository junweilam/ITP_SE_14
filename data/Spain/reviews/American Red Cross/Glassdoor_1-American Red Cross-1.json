They provided us with all kind of means to do our job. We were always backed up in every moment. They also provided us with continuous formation.", "cons": "To be so professional and correct can be a problem because governments prefer to hire other companies for providing the \"same\" services but cheaper than Red Cross. An example of this happened in Capdepera in 2010 when they chose a cheaper company that didn't provide the same services at all. So, many of the workers rejected to continue with this non-professional company."}]]
