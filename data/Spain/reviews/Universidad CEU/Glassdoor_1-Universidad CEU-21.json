The decrease in the number of students, along with a number of negligent management decisions which have almost ruined the institution, has increased the pressure on the teaching staff who is less interested in doing a good job. One has to consider that students arriving to private universities are mainly those who don\u00b4t pass teh access exams to public universities, so that indicates their studying profile. Media Studies Faculty is crowded, and with the new stdying plans (Bolonia) it will be getting even worse.
