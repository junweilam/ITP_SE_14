People easily get away with bad moral and bad work ethic, it is highly political and very little promotion unless you are in the circle of trust with managements.  NOT a good place for female workers since it is highly male dominated with little respect to women.  Women are not visible or appreciated if they hold technical responsibilities and always are bullied by male co-workers.  Not a good place for career growth since there is no promotion.  If you have high value and morals you should look into other place."}], []]
