All the exempt employees work late and log in on weekends to catch up with their work. This is a big elephant in the room that MSK leadership is aware of but never talks about the work load that is given to the research staff (all staff form data coordinators, patient managers, regulatory associates, supervisors, and managers). - There are always problems with under staffing and people have to cover and do tasks that are not exactly part of their role which can be extremely challenging and exhausting."}], []]
