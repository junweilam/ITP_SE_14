Finding people that share your interests and that value you for who you are.   The possibility to take leadership roles from the very beginning (I got to organize my own Alumni event after just 2 months in the org)  The international environment: the people you meet from all around the world. It is great to know that you can rely on an international network for any purposes: travelling work..  The possibility to go on an internship abroad (I did mine in Turkey for 3 months and along with my Erasmus was kind of one of the best experiences of my life).  The possibility to master the skills you are most interested in (marketing sales finance...) throught workshops conferences  The possibility to attend conferences (congresos) around the world where to improve your skills and meet people from around the world.  The possibility to always find a way to get over your weaknesses. For example I used to be null when confronting a group of people or talking in public. In order to overcome this I decided to go to Turkey to work as a monitor in a summer camp. There not only could I manage my students and give speeches in front of a camp of 100 international people but also they gave me the oppportunity to role as Speaker at a National Conference in Marmaris. There I had to prepare my speech and give it in front of all the attendants. It was awesome.,0.00041393787,0.0014085788,0.9981775
Despite my experience my relationship with Alumni etc etc I haven't got to get a proper job yet. But that is a personal issue (added to the situation of my country (Spain))....  I left after my internship in Turkey. I could have gone further but I decided that I didn't  really like any of the career areas (sales finance etc)  The culture might be shocking for most of the people (they usually think it as a secta) but I love itttttt. Dancing the rollcalls might sound creepy but they are so much fun and they really make a teambuilding!!!!,0.006314952,0.984288,0.009397095

The absolute worst managers you  could imagine. The British Council School is so poorly managed that staff turnover is incredibly high. 5 members of the English department quit this year. Ridiculously high workload which is exacerbated by so many pointless admin tasks which are there just to make a pretence that the school cares about its students. It doesn't. It cares about their parents money and nothing else. Entitled rude students are becoming the norm and the school turns a blind eye to all of this.  An atmosphere of fear prevails. Teachers are terrified that they will be fired if they so much as look at the wrong person in the wrong let alone suggest that there could be better ways to do thing.

People who want to be given more experience will find the environment quite frustrating after a while. There is not much communication between departments and this could be improved.

Support  as a teacher you never have to deal with complaints or difficult customers beyond an certain point.  Training  colleagues tell me it's not as good as other employers such as IH  but it's paid.  Atmosphere  depending on the centre (e.g. not Martinez Campos) colleagues are friendly and helpful.  International opportunities  it's relatively easy to move around in the BC.  Career development  I haven't ranked this very highly as their insistence on the DELTA exam means that some incapable people are promoted while other very capable people are stuck in monotonous positions. However if you have this exam there are decent prospects.  Holidays  very long about 6  9 weeks (although inflexible).,0.0430991,0.59882414,0.35807678
Rigid hierarchy  see above note on DELTA. There is little to no flexibility within jobs and promotions are very official while unfair.  False transparency  managers usually employ who they want (and know) and make the incredibly lengthy applications fit their foregone choice. This means a lot of time wasted in hopeless applications.  Antisocial timetables/bad contracts  the centres that offer decent timetables tend only to offer short contracts and those that offer permanent contracts demand antisocial working hours (Friday Saturday or both as well as evenings). Inequalities surrounding contracts are famous both within and outside the BC. Teachers are only registered as working parttime (with preparation time not included) which means they fall short of the threshold for a standard pension.  Managerial attitudes  due to the rigid hierarchy and since middle managers come exclusively from teaching backgrounds their attitude towards teachers can be painfully patronising (eliciting the obvious etc.).  Decreasing pay  pay rises always happen in retrospect and don't meet the real rise in the cost of living so teachers are proportionally poorer each year.,0.99899143,0.0008331536,0.00017545086

1. An institution with more than its fair share of hypocrisy and political infighting.  2. Too many staff out to feather their own nests  for example the School's former Secretary as well as a Senior Lecturer in Corporate Social Responsibility  both involved in the notorious Intituto Nóos scandal and attendant moneylaundering fraud and political corruption. A great School would bite the bullet and put things right. A mediocre one like ESADE would (and has) done its best to sweep the whole affair under the carpet.  4. Interfering Jesuits in the background pulling the management strings.  5. Slow obsolete with endless red tape.  6. A trendfollower not a trendsetter. 7. No opportunities for international staff (management is basically a local affair).   8. Lots of 'me too' research that looks good on paper but that is of a pretty low standard.  9. A School with truly miserable endowment funds  something that is reflected in every aspect of ESADE.  10. No real strengths (and certainly not CSR despite ESADE's assiduous efforts to hype its supposed 'values' in this field). 11. Progressive alienation of the local business community whose support the School needs if it is to make progress.,0.9971439,0.0025924905,0.0002635445

The newly appointed Global Dean and friends are generating organizational chaos. They improvise constantly. They have eliminated the best practices. No processes are in place. Staff is confused as they receive random guidelines most of the times contradicting each other. Their vulgarity in language and manners is causing rejection amongst the good professionals in the Academic Department. They lack of ethics at personal and consequently professional level. Their bad reputation in the higher education sector is well founded. On top of it there is discrimination. Example: a 7 month pregnant employee has been dismissed based on false reasons to mask the fact that they do not want to have her in maternity leave. Regarding the new appointments they got the position because of personal friendship with the Global Dean. No policy of equal opportunities is in place.,0.9986197,0.0011952214,0.00018508815

Unprofessional biased management. No proper organization. No respect to people for this company their staff is easily replaceable. There is high staff turnover.

The international students are fun to work with although immature at times but I love the diversity and I think the students find this a rich experience too. As a lecturer I feel that we have freedom to do things how we want although there has been a system of standardization put in place which means things are slightly more rigid than before.,0.0075266524,0.6569254,0.33554792
Despite having a good team and interesting students this company suffers from what many companies suffer from. It is hierarchical to an extreme meaning that neither the students nor the lecturers have a voice we are not consulted about changes but simply informed. The admin staff leave in droves owing to the rude and rigid attitude of the Dean at the Barcelona campus. This is a pity this could be a great business school but ironically suffers at the hand of bad people management and oldfashioned attitudes towards how to implement change. It is for this reason I no longer work there.,0.9967223,0.0027513506,0.00052636815

High staff turnover (if I went back ina  year I would probably not know anybody there) inflexible working hours (accountant calling because you were five minutes late but not checking when you left work). When I was working there there were even several people who were on sick leave due to stress or depression.  Most workers are unhappy and the company doesn't trust their employees. You have to do daily reports that nobody needs and later on you're critized for not having done something you stated in the report to have done. Client oriented not staff oriented.

"At work you feel like you are in a prison.  You are not allowed to congregate. Expats have no teacher rooms only cubicles and some offices.

You can be searched. You show ID when you come and again when you leave.  You are moved around campus constantly every semester. Your Lead Teacher is your warden. She is the only person you know and have contact with.  You have no voice and you are punished for contacting people other than your warden/LT. Just like inmates your warden has favorites and if you're not one too bad. You get your instructions in an auditorium with your fellow expat inmates and no questions allowed. Your mistakes are recorded in a file and your punishments are classified by mistake. More mistakes worse punishment. Clipboard ladies walk around to make sure you're in your class or cubicle.

Little team build up mentality. Sometimes you can perceive distrust and individualism. Salaries for PhD students are low and sometimes insufficient to cover basic expenses in a region like Madrid.

You have the freedom to choose your schedule noone keeps track of when you are in the office or not as long as you finish the work you need to do (this is common in academia).

The government is cutting a bit the research funding so the laboratories some times have it tough to get material for theoriticians it does not make much difference though. With the friendlyness of the people comes their loudness so if you are in an office with 5 other people it can get noisy some times.

Ideal place if you fit with its ideological orientation.

Overall it is becoming a less interesting place to be day by day. The decrease in the number of students along with a number of negligent management decisions which have almost ruined the institution has increased the pressure on the teaching staff who is less interested in doing a good job. One has to consider that students arriving to private universities are mainly those who don´t pass teh access exams to public universities so that indicates their studying profile. Media Studies Faculty is crowded and with the new stdying plans (Bolonia) it will be getting even worse. Private Universities in Spain are not worth it.,0.99861884,0.0012075213,0.00017365401
