It was for a temp position therefore the interview process was short. They experienced some technical issues so the interview itself started  with 15 mins delay.  Two interviewers  tell the truth they have not left a markâ€¦,0.9936644,0.006205106,0.00013048125

Very long and overly complicated process the interview questions are designed for multinational companies rather than a humanitarian organisation and were very generic. This is specific to my duty station but the interviewers did not seem to care too much about my answers and I was chosen based on my CV as I learnt later.,0.9989918,0.0008647246,0.0001435151

Since I lived in Texas at the time of the interview process we conducted our conversation via Skype. Also since it was just an internship the process was very easy and straightforward. My skills and educational background were the most important aspects of the interview. After landing the internship I was required to undergo a physical and sign a contract for the 3 month duration of the internship.,0.0025248835,0.13245787,0.8650173
I applied for an online job advertisement completed a special form available at UNHCR website and attached a cover letter. I got a phone call about 1 month later than was invited for an interview and test. The interview was about 1 hour long three persons an assistant an HR officer and another lady. Fully english competent based interview just their questions nothing being asked from my CV. It was devastating so to say but I felt it turned out good. They never called me though and two months passed since tried to call them but they mentioned technical problems..... They might call me but you know what this means...,0.00334984,0.99609214,0.00055792584
