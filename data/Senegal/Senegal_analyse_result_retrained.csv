"Lacking in Diversity and Inclusion. Not good at handling conflict and staff turnover. In some offices very hierarchical structure especially for a Danish organisation. Gender imbalance in management (""boys club"" vibe in SMT). Not responding to national staff concerns regarding salary grid unequal salaries and lack of benefits compared to expats. Bad career management and bad management on average. Some job descriptions not clear. Focus on getting money from donors rather that actual quality of the projets and on how the money is spent leading to projets that don't make sense on the ground.

 Working at Global Citizen Year was an absolutely fantastic experience from which I learnt a lot and that provided me with a broad set of transferable skills as well as incredible life experience.   There are many different aspects of the job which definitely keeps things interesting : working with local partners organizing and leading trainings 1:1 coaching and mentorship emergency response and risk management.   The philosophy and approach to holistic and experiential education that Global Citizen Year has developed is one with which I strongly resonate. It was truly an honor to a part of and have an effect on a profoundly impactful experience for so many incredible young people from many different backgrounds.    For me the work was relatively flexible having a large degree of control over my schedule and responsibilities though also often working with a small team to organize events and set up and run all aspects of the program.   The broader Global Citizen Year program with teams spread across 5 countries is also a pleasure to be a part of to learn from and contribute to. It was so rewarding to have colleagues from so many different countries based in vastly different locations around the world yet to have a common set of values experiences and values that bound us together.  There is a genuine sense that the organization as a whole is truly committed to the vision and mission that it espouses and the leadership at Global Citizen Year is incredible. Each year that I worked there felt very different from the last as there always seemed to be a willingness to improve and refine the program.,0.00026865726,0.00062715594,0.9991042
 Being a team leader is not something that I could do forever. It can be very intense and at times frustrating (although equally there are slower periods in which to recover).   Given the nature of the work and the relatively small country teams there is limited room for progression. However the team leader role provides skills and experience that are highly valuable for other employers.,0.9817222,0.01747948,0.0007984302

To me the number one pro are the fantastic colleagues : the organisation is packed with intellectually curious dedicated and distinctively kind people who deeply care about the world around them. There are other pros:   A dedication to build a welloiled organisation: this is a fast growing organisation and things aren't always perfect but the Leadership works visibly hard to improve what should be improved on (systems and processes notably). One thing that noticeably improved last year for instance was IDinsight's external comms;  Real opportunities to build a career: this year most new Senior Managers  Associate Directors and Directors came through internal promotions. There are career paths for Economists and Project management roles and nonPhD holders  can apply for Economist or Junior Economist positions internally;  As the reputation of the organisation grows projects are becoming more exciting too (larger scope more influential partners  new geographies);    Generous benefit package (great health insurance paid leave): the organisation cares for the wellbeing of its staff !,0.0015935503,0.008840352,0.9895661
