Not a structured interview and it depends on your connection in the organization. You might get interviewed by people who have  a Master degree or people from East Asia which means you won't get the job if you are really skilled,0.9972149,0.0026649314,0.00012014857
"I was not expecting that HCT for the 2nd time will reject my candidacy based on my religion's sect. Both times I have successfully completed my technical as well as Executive Dean interview with position remarks. I got salary details with allowance but the last step is when they send the applicant the ""Introductory form"" which decides whether you will be hired or not. I have been rejected both times and upon search on the internet I concluded that if you are a ""Shia Muslim"" there is no space for you in HCT whatever you are a skilled and qualified professional person. They still doubt your honesty and denies to get a job for which you qualified successfully for the series of interviews.",0.9966671,0.0031758172,0.00015702339

They contacted me over the position asking for a next day interview with teaching demonstration I asked for a two days delay as I have my job and I am busy.  The panel consists of 2 PhD holders from the department I intend to join  HR officer. The interview was smooth and friendly different technical questions related to my experience and to the position I answered most of the questions the questions I didn’t answer where not related to my background at all.  They sent me an email the 2nd day saying the interview came with very positive feedback and we need to continue the hiring process after the team and HR agreed on me. So it is a matter of time to receive the offer or joining letter. Then they asked for a bunch of documents references and certificates which I all provided and the process was going smooth until here. THE SHOCK is that after 3 weeks they sent me a rejection letter as the committee (higher management) rejected my application without mentioning any clear reason which left me in denial and confusion????I contacted my references to make sure they provided a good feedback on me and they confirmed and sent me a copy of the reference letter. It was more than perfect. The management or what ever committee was there who didn’t interview me didn’t see me and seems like they didn’t take in consideration the panel positive feedback  good references just rejected my application for no clear reason! Note: it was not related to security clearance as mostly this is the critical part in the hiring. Security clearance came clean already as the HR mentioned after I called them. I called the HR to ask for the reason she didn’t know it came from the management Even the HR mentioned that everyone is upset ad they wanted you in the department.Anyway hct still a good place to work in as I asked some employees but I didn’t get lucky this time.,0.78118163,0.21713804,0.0016803202

After the interview was done i looked and searched for this guy's research history to find out that his last published paper was in 2015 ... 3 years ago... and its even not published in journal indexed by scopus.

I was aware that they are wellknown for bullying and playing bad cop/good cop during the interview but I was unprepared for the utter rudeness and bullying that did occur.

I have an MA and 20 years experience in the field of teaching and have interviewed people quite a bit in my life so was quite taken aback at how unprofessional it was. A friend did end up getting the job and loathed it there to the point where she has since gotten out of teaching so I guess it was lucky I stayed put in my current position.

Applying was fine. The interview was bizarre (four very tiredlooking faculty with I think 2 publications between them). Negotiations following the interview were slow then stopped. I quit before accepting contract. Human Resources were shockingly unprofessional  I can understand why most people want to leave.,0.9920442,0.007816837,0.00013901501
Professional interview. There were four people on the panel. Two from the Dubai campus and two from the Abu dhabi campus. The interview was formal but I was made to feel very relaxed. The interview process was relatively straightforward and very quick from the offer of interview stage. It did take some weeks before I heard after submitting my application but once the ball was rolling it seemed fine.,0.00076093734,0.99362385,0.005615179
I had an English exam followed by a panel interview later. The English exam was computer based. The panel interview was both technical and HR. I had to later go in for a HR discussion,0.0014110546,0.99837816,0.00021078816
One inperson interview in the US. The Dean and his colleage had a very informal meeting with me. My credentials preceeded me and they wanted to hire me. The interview was more about whether I was congenial and whether my vision was aligned with theirs.,0.00047265232,0.999158,0.0003693457

Onehour interview following completion of online form including statement of teaching philosophy. Many questions are factual but some encourage reflection e.g on your own strengths and weaknesses. The interview format is generally informal and seems like a conversation. The aim may be not just to find out what kind of teacher you are but what kind of person you are and how easily you will fit in with and support the current team. There is time for questions from the interviewee at the end: ask about culture housing but bear in mind that many more detailed questions are best asked to HR after a job offer.,0.0014511844,0.9980621,0.0004866938

The process was fine for me as like many others I came to ZU from a program in Turkey where about half the instructors came from. As with everything who you know matters a great deal! This also meant that I knew most people who interviewed me.   The process consists of an online form followed by a video conference panel interview,0.0004321934,0.99748164,0.0020862
Unorganized; HR staff who scheduled the interview was completely unprofessional and disorganized  I had to instruct her on next steps because she was clueless and could barely speak English. They wanted me to spend a lot of money to certify my degrees BEFORE they gave me an offer. What a joke. Interview panel started arguing with each other when they were interviewing me.,0.9990301,0.0008067571,0.00016312675
Video conference with two people. Supposedly others were supposed to be there but they weren't. Very relaxed and informal. Traditional interview questions  why are you the right candidate for this role? Why do you want to work at ZU? How will you do this job? Only the single video call no phone screen before no inperson after so kind of crazy to accept the job without going there or meeting anyone.,0.9911363,0.008634059,0.0002296339
First I was asked to fill in a website application with student evaluations job history school transcripts  cv etc. I was then asked to participate in a video and or phone conference and interviewed with a panel. The session was simple question and answer. I was hired and had a  personal interview and that administrator decided to keep me rather than move me to the other campus which is where I was originally hired to work.,0.0010746131,0.99865746,0.00026782713
