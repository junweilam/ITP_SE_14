This will prevent you from being promoted to higher faculty rank, and obtain the annual faulty financial award.\r\n\u2022\tNo job security. Any contract can be, and they often are, cancelled with 6 months notice, no reason needed. If you are not Emirati, you will have to leave some day.\r\n\u2022\tHCT has key performance indicators (KPI) implemented across all departments. You are required to meet the KPIs set by upper management. Failure to do so will impact your performance. \r\n\u2022\tTheir salaries and benefits are considered the lowest among government universities. \r\n\u2022\tYou may be assigned to teach in other campuses, which requires commuting during rush hours.\r\n\u2022\tHigh turn over in employment. Every year many faculty resign. \r\n\u2022\tA culture of fear within this organization, poor communication, and lack of transparency from upper management.\r\n\u2022\tAll faculty are upset and not happy with their work environment. You never hear any compliments about the upper management.\r\n\u2022\tIronically, the upper management are promoting happiness, yet, no one is happy.\r\n\u2022\tSeventy two faculty applied for fast-track promotion when the new ranking system was introduced, only twelve got.

Don't be surprised if you see a security guard looking in on you at 8:01 to check you are there. Don't be surprised if you get summoned to the director's office because the security dropped by your classroom 1 minute before the scheduled end of class but you weren't there. You can't let then leave early even if you've finished everything. You need to plan more just in case. However the students soon realise the idea is to get through the time and but the materials and have hundreds of ways of using up everyone's time.\r\nThere is flexi time but you can't really use it because everyone used to do there hours and leave early on a Thursday. Now there are compulsory meetings every Thursday just to finish the week of nicely.\r\nHCT has a compulsory happiness agenda taken from the government. Every campus tried to outdo each other on happiness initiatives. You will be happy and unhappiness will not be entertained. Be prepared to be happy.\r\nStudents really are useless. When I say useless I mean completely and totally useless. They have absolutely no idea hire to study and don't care. They have never studied in their lives and aren't going to break the habit of a life time. Creating is rife in exams, assignments and projects. Essay mills are making a fortune from these students. If you report them expect to have your integrity question first because you asked it to Halen and you didn't give then enough support to achieve the assignment in the first place. It is never their fault. They are victims of poor teaching. \r\nGrades are often normalised. This is HCT talk for changed. When a large number of students fail it is obviously the fault of the teacher so the grade boundaries are changed even though the students don't know the content. \r\nIn order for HCT to climb a university ranking scheme they have decided to increase the number of PhD holders as faculty regardless of where the diploma was issued or how skilled and experienced they are.  This has resulted in highly specialised theoretical professors trying to teach quite genteel courses in engineering, IT, or business with very little idea on how to teach lie level general themes. You will be lent on heavily if you have a broader background and severely reprimanded for not being a team player if you don't prepare their lessons and hand over lesson plans and power point slides. \r\nYou can be asked to teach split shifts and don't think it won't happen to you. Ask for a written guarantee you won't be asked to work more than an 8 hour day and see how far you get. You will have at least one day where you have to work 8 to 6 or 8, or 10 till 8pm and probably 2 days like it. You won't be teaching solidly and they'll say you can clock out and go home but who dies this when you have a2 hour break?\r\nAdmin and management are generally incompetent. So many positions have been culled it had left the others over worked and with so many people leaving the new ones don't know what to do and leave quite quickly too. Emirati staff, on the whole are lazy and useless preferring to drink tea and chat rather than work. \r\nSalary and allowances have not kept pace with inflation. The UAE is expensive with lots of hidden costs. Basic services such as electricity, water, internet etc are more than double what you pay in the US or UK. Internet is nearly $100 a month for a slow connection. \r\nA good school will cost 80000 dhs a year but HCT will only pay 30000. You have to pay about $15000 a year per child out of your own salary. It's not worth it especially as the schools are quite poor and hire the last experienced (cheapest) teachers possible.\r\nThis is only the tip of the ice berg. \r\nI could go on and on.

Students are allowed to skip classes or turn in work at such low quality the teacher does not even know how to grade it. Students cheat on papers and exams and teachers are not allowed to fail them. Students do 10% of the work that would be required in the equivalent course in the UK or Canada. HCT shows the accrediting committees all the fancy course outlines and technology.

After my first week in classes I abandoned that plan, and after a month there I questioned whether I'd make it through the initial 3-year contract.\r\n\r\nI found the daily stress there to be untenable. Not only was I on mandatory overtime (22 contact periods per week - ridiculous in a \"collegiate\" environment \u2013 though some colleagues were working up to 25), but they emphasize paperwork/professional development/meetings at the expense of doing a quality job in the classroom.\r\n\r\nThere were mandatory office hours - 8-5 Sunday to Thursday. In fact, when I arrived the mandatory hours were 8-4, but then we got a new director and assistant director. The \u2018Supervisors\u2019 would roam the massive faculty room to ensure all their teachers were at their desks until 5.\r\n\r\nAll faculty (approx. 70 at FWC) are relegated to one huge room in which they are assigned a workstation with absolutely no privacy. It was noisy as well. Administration insisted that such an environment promoted communication, collaboration, and coordination (the infamous 3 C's of HCT). They push \"teamwork\" ad nauseam.\r\n\r\nSome students were OK, while many others were nightmares in abayas. Basically, HCT focuses on increasing the student population (thus bringing in more money from the government), resulting in \"students\" who shouldn't be there, young ladies who view college as a means of providing a social network. Often classes were out of control - several teachers walked out of their classes during my last semester there, including me (twice).\r\n\r\nThe curriculum went from bad the first year I was there to ludicrous the second year. They switched from an integrated skills curriculum to strands, requiring us to teach language skills in separate classes. That curriculum proved to be a debacle.\r\n\r\nIf you like meetings, then HCT is the place for you. As a rule, I hate them. I believe that, with few exceptions, meetings are a waste of time. At a previous college in Saudi Arabia we had one mandatory meeting per month, and I found that marginally acceptable. At HCT I had two mandatory meetings per week. That was simply insane.\r\n\r\nAnd the conferences - mandatory, mandatory, mandatory. And they would punish you if you didn't attend them.\r\n\r\nThey pushed professional development ad nauseam as well - PEP, goals, meetings, seminars, etc. They even went so far as to hire a PD company from the USA to impose PD activities on us. At the first staff meeting for the new year we found ourselves playing in \"teams\" with pieces of rope for about 30 minutes. Again, it was insane, and a colossal waste of time considering the formidable teaching schedule and new curriculum for which we needed to prepare our lessons.\r\n\r\nMy first week in the classroom I was observed by my supervisor - and get this, it was also my first time with one of the classes. Insanity again!\r\n\r\nI got little relief from the stress as work when I went home to my apartment. An Emirati family with two small children lived directly above me, and the noise would extend into the early morning hours. I complained to them, the apartment manager, and HCT for nine months with NO relief.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive they \"give\" you 30,000 dirhams and one week to buy all the stuff for your dwelling. You have to buy everything, including kitchen appliances, washer, etc. Keep in mind that this is a LOAN, and it's amortized over the course of your 3-year contract. If you resign early, you pay back part of that loan. It's not so easy to sell your stuff, either, unless you happen to be there when new teachers arrive.\r\n\r\nI will give them credit for paying me on time every month and for providing me with a decent annual travel allowance (for me about $2800). They were also generous with the gratuity when I left. But that's all the credit I can give them.\r\n\r\nBasically, HCT was a major disappointment for me. I don't consider them a college. The environment there, especially the behaviour of many of the students, reminded me of a middle school setting.

But that, too, is a thing of the past, with no housing allowance increase in years (in one of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate markets), education benefits for dependent children slashed to a maximum 60,000AED annual (a 50% reduction) and what is likely to be a reduction in annual travel allowances (which have been reclassified, but not yet fully explained to faculty \u2013 a fine example of the decline in institutional communication and transparency).  \r\n\r\nHCT contracts used to remain pretty much the same from year-to-year, but these days they are subject to an increasing number of amendments.

The result is a lack of input and control over work by faculty, in addition to a knowledge vacuum that fosters rumor and breeds distrust.  Few teachers or staff feel anymore that what they do matters, or that management has any concern for their needs or interests.  In fact, management seems most concerned with impressing its political bosses, which is perhaps why the media and marketing departments have been given so much attention.  \r\n\r\nThe goodwill between management and faculty that used to be one of the more noteworthy features of this institution is long gone and unlikely to ever return \u2013 certainly not under the current regime.

HCT students are full of arrogance and do not feel any hesitation to treat teacher as their personal servants. In the class room, students watch movies on computer and if a teacher stops them, they will complain the administration that the teacher does not know how to teach, and the faculty have to face  unnecessary enquires from the administration.   If a student get failed due to his poor interest in study, the blame will be on teacher. The students uses bulling and other tactics to disrespect the teacher. It is a reality that even some female students do not feel ashamed to blame teacher for harassing. The academic background of HCT students is highly poor.  Those who enroll for undergraduate degree have IQ level below than 8-grade students. After studying a course for almost six months, students even can not define the course. The students have highly poor knowledge of Math and English subjects. \r\n\r\nThe administration lives in stone ages, and treat faculty as a salve. It is common in HCT  that you go to take class and then you got a notice from HCT administration that you are fired and there is no need to come tomorrow. In my 3 years stay, I personally witnessed 3 cases. Even a minor human mistake from a faculty can be the reason of firing.  The admin use any stupid clause to fire you. A faculty has to survive between students and administration stupidness.
