Owned and run by sri lanki who is never there. very racist organization that only caters to hindus. Pay is terrible and once hired you are trapped with them through your work visa. \r\n\r\nThey dont teach. Only cover 2 chapters in an entire semester per course! Its outstanding what these kids learn. Teachers dont care and neither do students. Grades are altered to show progress. They are all lies. All professors change students grades and allow them to cheat on exams.\r\n\r\nStay away from Sharjah College that is now Troy University, Sharjah Campus."}]]
