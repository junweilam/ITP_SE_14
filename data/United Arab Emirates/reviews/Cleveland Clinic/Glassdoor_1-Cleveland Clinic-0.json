The whole hospital is far more toxic than any other hospitals I have worked in. I quickly learned that this is due to the toxicity bleeding out from the toxic COS and CMO. Physicians bad-mouth others at the cafeteria; clinical administrators and nursing directors - an entitled group of people too bad-mouth and gossip about everyone at the cafe. Stay away from these tables if you want to have a sane working environment. Don't trust even your office mate or share anything with him/her (physicians share office here) as it can reach others. Chiefs are often nice people but can be toxic due to the fear of losing their jobs/being fired by C-suite members. The fear of being fired is palpable here than any other hospitals that I have worked in. \r\n\r\nAbusive: C-suite consists of abusive men. The toxicity and abusive natures of your institute are due to these CEO, COS and CMO. All three are poor, abusive and manipulative men who should not be allowed to lead any hospitals. Most of the achievements of CCAD is due to Ann, our previous CNO. It would be a great shame if these three men got the credits for Ann's hard work. They came and introduced 140% booking without recognizing the hardship on the physicians. Physicians accept their top-down policy because they are fearful of losing jobs. These abusive C-suite members think they own you and would easily cut your vacation days so that they can report the right number of visits to Mubadala and keep their ridiculously high-paying jobs. We are forced to increase our surgery cases to appease these men. I have never worked in a hospital where patients are just numbers. You will drag your feet to work after 3 months here.\r\n\r\nHigh-turnover:The C-suite is so abusive that I have seen so many people thrown to the curb or told to resign. People are DISPOSABLE here. They get rid of you very quickly here.Good clinical administrators are substituted by bullies who keep getting promoted by these abusive CEO, COS and CMO. Good physicians leave within 20 months or already thinking of leaving after 3 months here. Remember, all physicians will go through probation and your job is at the mercy of your chiefs or clinical administrators (who bad-mouth physicians like it is their second nature). I have seen docs disappearing from their roles very quickly. I am not sure why any docs will want to take the risk of working at this toxic and abusive hospital - imagine leaving your comfortable jobs and home countries and come here and then told to leave within 6 months - what will you do? Imagine the shame!\r\n\r\nDocs are paid based on their passports. So be prepared to see Egyptian and Pakistani docs making half of what you make. Americans are worshipped here, and some American nurses make more money than the physicians here.\r\n\r\nOverall, there is no reason to come and work here until Mubadala get rid of the CEO,COS and CMO.
