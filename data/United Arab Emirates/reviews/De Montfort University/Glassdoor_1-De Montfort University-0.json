Inauthentic understanding of diversity \r\nUpper management fosters an overtly competitive culture of fear and ignores the authentic achievements of staff and students \r\nA distinct lack of promised resources for students and staff\r\nNot really interested in teaching, more the outward surface view of the Uni in the region, academic quality does not appear to be high on the agenda at present\r\nSchool is quite far out of Dubai and isolated."}]]
