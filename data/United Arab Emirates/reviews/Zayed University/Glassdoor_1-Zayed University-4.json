Up until summer 2019 there were wonderful long summer vacations of 10 - 12 weeks (depending on  Eid tagging on) and summer school was an optional extra that a lot of people wanted to do because it was paid pro rata and they still got a good long vacation. \r\n\r\nGood opportunities for in house PD though attendance funding for TESOL Arabia was  cut.

Going over to cash housing (as opposed to uni paid housing where ZU took on the tenancy) meant that unless you are a couple with no children - (families with kids really came out badly) - you might find that you would have to go for an inferior apartment (the decrease in rents in Abu Dhabi, however, did make going on to cash housing beneficial  to some people, as they could pocket the difference). Cash housing also means you are liable for the municipality charge added on to the electricity and water bill every month.\r\n\r\nWith a couple of exceptions, I didn't find colleagues particularly friendly or supportive - you only really met people in your own department unless you were a smoker. Apparently the smokers corner is the place to meet people and socialize - and I even heard of non-smokers dropping in to get the latest gossip.\r\n\r\nHR (human capital) is a nightmare. Nasty and unhelpful people who think you should be beholden to them and that they are doing you a special favour. One colleague dubbed them 'sub human' resources - even lower than 'inhuman resources' that they were often called.  We often wondered why we weren't asked to rate them, as all the administrators,  professors and teachers have to be, by their peers or students. But I think the rating would be so low as to be an embarrassment to the university.\r\n\r\nStudents are mostly nice enough but in what was ABP before it morphed into something else, it was difficult to motivate them. The English entry level to the uni is now supposed to have been raised, so maybe not having those very low level students will make a difference. I found when I was there, a lot of  students, did everything possible to get out of doing any work but wanted the maximum grades. You kind of get into the way of how it is in the Gulf, grade adjustments so even weak students pass, etc. \r\n\r\nThere is also a huge move towards catering for special needs students, so teachers who have no experience of this are often obliged to have one or two special needs students in their class with very little back up. Having had this more often than not, it has been both good and bad - I enjoyed trying to help my special needs students, but I would say I would spend on average about 3 hours a week extra catering to their needs - and it is the luck of the draw whether you get them or not (though if you have done a good job, you are more likely to get a special needs student again - so maybe don't do a good job if you think it a burden!)\r\n\r\nI might add that when I left in May 2019, it was the biggest cohort of leavers ever - across both AD and Dubai campuses.

Provosts came and went with varying degrees of competence, ranging from micromanagers, to great ideas but little common sense, to wanting to remake the university into one like one in the US.  Only one really had insight into the Emirati culture.  But none quite knew how to set goals to work toward the vision, partly (and realistically) hampered by the federal government's attitude toward higher education and the penchant of the country's leaders to always think the grass was greener...somewhere else.  There was little, if any, trust of anyone but the inner circle.  Some were behind the scenes controllers, or back-stabbers if need be, and they tended to get rid of anyone who disturbed their apple cart.  There was a Board of Visitors (BOV) (now defunct) from the US who advised the president, but while well-meaning, were led into believing what the inner circle wanted them to believe.  The university suffered from leadership changes which created new colleges, new institutes, new what-evers, leading to expenditures beyond the capacity of the funding.  It has seemed to me that the university was caught between the Sheikh's vision of a research university and the ability of the various provosts to know how to accomplish that.  Certainly now, the university has its faculty in a Catch-22 of teaching on a par with a small community college while expecting research like a top-tier research university.  No university can sustain that and maintain both teaching and research standards.  \r\n\r\nWhen the university was created, it was based on the US model of higher education and funding was excellent.  However, the BOV also based salaries on US universities of comparable size, completely ignoring the reality of living and working in the UAE.  This has led to ongoing problems as noted in other reviews, and when the unlimited funding was stopped by the Ministry of Finance, the university slipped into an on-going downward cycle of trying to work toward the vision without the financing essential to achieving it by eating its own seed-corn as it were.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the university is in upheaval--the new president has been replaced after implementing questionable policies and practices.  Perhaps the next president, a highly respected member of the Sharjah royal family, will be able to turn all this around, but she will need the wisdom of Solomon and the active backing of the Nahayan family."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Assistant Professor and Assistant Chair - Department of Psychology, Dubai", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Dubai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I was at Zu from August 2013 until May 2019.

Whether we are talking about research projects, publications, conferences, workshops, the financial support is like nowhere else. During my time there I presented papers at several conferences all over the world (US, Australia, South Africa, Turkey, Japan...), i accompanied students to present their research (US and Canada), I had the privilege of enrolling in the Innovative Teaching Practice Certificate and others at the CEI, I started and finished the International Faculty SoTL Leadership Program (a ZU partnership with The University of British Columbia, and others. I got support from statisticians, research assistants. Everything I needed to teach and do research, at least in my field, was there. I\u2019ve seen the Department of Psychology grow more and more each year. I started at Zu with the Psychology and Human Services Program and became Assistant Chair when we were ready to launch the Psychology Program. Couldn\u2019t be prouder of the program, department, students, colleagues, college, and university who supported this important endeavor. Students now have a pure PSY credentialed program at Zu. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t see it launched, but participated in the Masters Program draft. Soon it will be up and running, allowing our students to have all the practice, knowledge, background they need to work as psychologists in the UAE one day. I repeat, I couldn\u2019t be prouder. It is fair to bring also all the facilities and extra support you find at Zu: the IT department is just amazing, you get all the top IT materials you need and assistance too, always ready to help; facilities are beautiful and makes you wanting to be at work; you can even use the gym and classes provided (as I did, during lots of lunch breaks). Zu pampers you with lots of initiatives organized both by students and faculty, with research opportunities for undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. Financially speaking, you get allowance for housing, fees, plane tickets, health insurance. What else? I could continue on going. This was definitely the best place I have ever worked in. I had to leave because of family reasons, and it was the hardest decision I ever had to make. In the end, I didn\u2019t say proper goodbye to everyone, as I feel I will be able to go back one day.

The following criteria are deemed essential for upcoming revolving door positions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1.     Candidates must be docile, meek and highly deferential to incompetent line managers.  These managers are generally less qualified than you, have zero management training, frequently dismal research records, become malevolent if you ever disagree with them and have been selected solely on the basis of their unwavering loyalty to the Dean.\r\n\r\n2.     Candidates are advised they must dispense with any old fashioned notions that they are important and valued by management.  Our HR practices revolve around Stalin\u2019s dictum of \u2018no man, no problem\u2019 (yes that is the Russian dictator). In the interests of gender equality, this applies to women also.\r\n\r\n3.     Candidates must understand, and accept, from the outset that their respective Dean is Gods representative on earth and his/her divine will must be done at all times.  It is irrelevant if your Dean lies constantly, promotes only their friends, lacks any genuine integrity, bullies staff, is despotic and couldn\u2019t manage a pizza order properly not to mind manage people.\r\n\r\n4.     Candidates must be willing to ship their integrity,  sense of fairness and all ethics back to their country of origin on taking up the position. ZU will however not pay for any associated shipping costs.\r\n\r\n5.     Candidates must have a strong stomach for nepotism, blatant favouritism and bullying and be willing to ignore instances of the above especially when they negatively affect hard working and excellent colleagues.  Representatives from the University\u2019s happiness committee will however try to make you feel better by giving you a happy face sticker.\r\n\r\n6.     Candidates must understand that ZU is primarily only about \u2018presentation\u2019.  If the building is shiny and bright then the place must be amazing right?  Employees must answer in the affirmative at all times to this question.\r\n\r\n7.     Candidates must understand that their three/four year contract is in fact meaningless.  You will endure an annual faculty review assessing your performance by your incompetent line manager based on goalposts that shift like the sand outside your cell (office) window and whatever is flavour of the month.  In addition, your Dean will over-ride this system in the interests of promoting their personal brand of nepotism.\r\n\r\n8.     Candidates must be world class researchers but also excel at teaching, advising, serving the community, being on multiple committees and being innovative.  Sub-optimal performance in any of these categories will result in your immediate deportation as we believe these are things you can achieve over night by merely willing them into existence.  After all, God created the universe in a mere six days.\r\n\r\n9.     Candidates must be aware that the greatest sin that can be committed is a perceived lack of collegiality.  This can be avoided by always saying \u2018yes\u2019 no matter what, turning a blind eye to blatant abuses of power and position, never disagreeing with management and stroking our infantile egos on a constant basis.  Please remember your employers have very thin skins.\r\n\r\n10.  Candidates must be aware that the University has zero real interest in staff development or staff retention.  Irrespective of your abilities and accomplishments, management reserves the right to get rid of you for any reason we invent at any time (particularly if we suspect you don\u2019t think we are amazing). \r\n\r\n11.  Candidates must continuously stress themselves with innovation.  This is an important KPI dreamed up by an important person in senior management in the hope that someone will develop a better mouse-trap. \r\n\r\n12.  Candidates must understand that the majority of students have very poor English, have minimal interest in learning, and that attendance at University is a way of getting out of the house to hang out with their friends before they get married off.  Our students like to regularly visit one of the several beauty parlours in the University so  please ensure that assignments do not negatively impact on this important activity.  Also note that the university bookshop closed down due to a lack of student interest in actual books. \r\n\r\n13.  Candidates must not over-tire students, and certainly never upset delicate student sensibilities.  Never suggest that things in the country are anything other than perfect and please limit all assignment activities to an eight grade level and a workload of half a page maximum.   Please provide students with a nap in class as required.\r\n\r\n14.  Finally, candidates are advised that all of the above criteria for a successful candidate are endorsed by senior management whose preferred management style is creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation, and by promoting those that excel at these activities. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCandidates who are desperate, washed up or have no-where else to go, and who meet the above criteria and accept our way of doing things are strongly encouraged to apply.  Candidates are also kindly asked to interpret the negative reviews on this website as \u2018lurid fiction\u2019 by the disgruntled and place their trust in the, albeit few, positive reviews (which have been written by members of our HR department with really poor English ability)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Experience is heavily influenced  by which department you work in", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Mar 2012", "job_title": "Current ZU Employee in Dubai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Co-workers are generally friendly and cooperative. Students are usually respectful and positive. The building facilities are spacious and there is plenty of office space. Overall employment is stable and designed specifically as a teaching college. Therefore if you wish to focus on teaching and have others design the curriculum this is a good place to go , work, leave with a nice salary. Great place to teach for people who have already retired, never had a job or for those without the qualifications to work at universities elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThe frequent movement and rehiring of old adminstration in the same position with or without a new title is a unique advantage for management seeking work at this university. So it appears possible with the right contacts to come make good money leave and expect to return 3 to 6 years later at a higher salary. \r\n\r\nFriends and networking are held in high esteem and a definite advantage when seeking employment  at ZU . Consequently,  you will find groups of expats that worked elsewhere across the globe successfully having friends hired to work with them at ZU. So in various departments you will find large numbers of Indians, British or Turkish expats for example that are 'old friends and neighbors'. \r\n\r\nFor those that have retired and are simply seeking an income this is a wonderful place to work as there are many who are well past retirement age at ZU.", "cons": "Salaries are not transparent or based on work experience. So you will see people working side by side making completely different incomes and with completely different benefit packages. Also what you are hired at is basically what you are getting on your last day whether it be 1,3, 6 or 9 years later.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is rhetoric about research it is actually frowned upon in some departments at this university. Few actually do research and those that do it keep it hidden. There is a visible class system between management and faculty. Everyone is on limited contracts and are afraid to complain. So you see management''s secretaries using the latest computers for emails and faculty carrying around 10 year old laptops they are expected to use for everything. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are also Deans , Chairs and Academic Management going up to the highest levels with no academic experience or credentials thus there is little understanding of the facilities , technology, budgets or skills needed in today's teaching and research environment. For new comers it is a surprise to find that upper management has no real degree and has never published or is often unskilled and not knowledgeable in the areas they oversee. \r\n\r\nThus you see things like  a dean  promoted from assistant secretary to full professor with no teaching experience or research experience. How do they do the job? By hiring unskilled educators at low salaries with the expectation that people will be grateful and non-challenging . At the same time firing highly qualified or skilled faculty because they are 'too active, too popular with students or are involved with community or research activities that could distract from their teaching duties\".\r\n\r\n A sure way lose a position at ZU is to publicly state that something is not working or needs to be changed. Anything that may reflect negatively on a superior is viewed as an unacceptable topic to discuss publicly.   In other words, employees are expected to work but not outshine  their superiors or question decisions. \r\n\r\nIn some ways this makes ZU an ideal if boring place to work or go to school. Those that are  satisfied with doing the minimum  and can remain agreeable to all requests will find it a pleasant place to work will  often  stay through and past standard retirement age. \r\n\r\nIn this manner you find inadequate management staying for years without any  real scrutiny of qualifications or assessment of work from employees often, once in administration, moving up the ladder quickly then sitting (literally sleeping) taking advantage of numerous medical enhancing services etc without any accountability. Although employees will whisper about bosses who never come to work or teachers that don't come to class or who only chat with students but don't expect any work they don't complain loudly or too frequently. \r\n\r\nPublicly there are sometimes attempts to show change reports are given out and announcements made. For the public there is change as at the highest levels there is often a turnover however the primary positions seem to rotate between a few people who come work a few years then leave only to return a few years later in the same position at a higher salary. Thus it appears more like the reshuffling of people rather than any real change occurring. A good example of this is in the frequent turnover of provosts. \r\n\r\n\r\nZU offers no tenure or job security so if someone does for any reason make a superior unhappy there is little chance of remaining employed. This fosters fear in employees and bullying behavior amongst administration that face no penalty for acting inappropriately . The status quo for middle  management is to support lower management and upper management to support middle management  so no questions asked ."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "No gender equality", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "13 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Instructor in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "easy teaching (just too much of it). good facilities overall. comfortable lifestyle even thought salaries are pathetic", "cons": "terrible treatment of female faculty and staff. women are underrepresented in management. male students routinely bully female faculty then accuse them of inappropriate behavior. before accepting the job, i fully accepted that women in the middle east have few to no rights but the rhetoric of the university suggests tolerance and respect for all employees. this is not the case at all. women are commonly passed over for promotion (most professors are male, most instructors are female). no support especially for single women who face great challenges in the UAE"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "It's Not a University; It's a Trap and a Prison", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Associate Professor in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some nice colleagues as most embrace a siege mentality banding together to persevere against a vicious, prejudiced and discriminatory senior administration and federal bureaucracy.", "cons": "You will be treated as disposable garbage as a faculty member (and that includes senior faculty such as full professors in the senior colleges).

The university was originally a state run university. Recently, as this has been happening in UAE in general, the family of the country have been privatizing government owned properties as they are the ruling family members. The sons of the king have taken over the university as a way to make money off of tuition, therefore you can see that the main objective of this \"public\" university is driven by making profits any way they can. This includes squeezing employees of any work they possibility can provide, and trying to nickle and dime them out of any money they might give them as a salary. \r\n\r\nThis said, let me explain to you why I give this University a one star rating. Let us start off by saying that when I originally started working in 2010 I was promised several things, including a furniture allowance (notably not enough to furnish a 2 bedroom house), free health care (don't go the the hospital if you do not have anything worst than a common cold if you want to live), dental (which is actually good), and housing (which is okay); and finally a salary. These were actually verbal promises, and that is where I made a grave mistake, the salary promised to me was substantially different from when I actually got there. Keep in mind that this was sent to me directly from HR, but upon arrival after I had shipped my furniture and my car and MY ENTIRE LIFE to the UAE from the U.S. (including quitting my old job and screwing over my chair which was actually nice doing) I was screwed over by the HR. I was given a salary approximately 30 percent lower than was was promised. I argued and argued but could not change this.. I was forced to take it or leave. So i accepted. \r\n\r\nWorking for the University and trying to make suggestions to management is like speaking down a black hole, they love sucking in all the comments and suggestions from you but where do these suggestions and comments end up?? No one knows.... I'ts like the placebo affect, you feel so good giving your suggestions, but when you find out that they do nothing you feel bad again.. \r\n\r\nWork loads are horrible... They expect so much research from you but make you teach 4 courses per semester. That would be fine if the courses they assigned you was the same each semester, but no.. A new set of courses every semester. \r\n\r\nThey so desperately want to be like a western university but the they lack the fundamentals of proper respect for humans. HR seems like a black box, requests, emails, information goes in but you never know what comes out. So many faculty members that have complained to the HR about their poor work some how do not get their contracts renewed.. \r\n\r\nThe Ipad dilemma  is discussed in others reviews adequately. \r\n\r\nI was part of a large group of faculty members that left this past summer, we were fed up with the problems at the university. I went back to get summer pay but others went without.

The faculty and staff are very collegial and supportive--from the provosts to the administrative support staff. The salaries are higher than almost any other country in the world (Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the only ones that pay better and have better benefits, like transportation allowances), the free accommodations are excellent (huge villas for families and spacious 2 bedroom flats for singles), and travel for conferences is generous (full airfare, hotel and other travel expenses). It is easy to get internal research grants up to $30,000 (USD) and external grants from the government up to $1 million (USD). Unlike some universities in the Arab Gulf, Zayed University strives to retain good faculty; promotion policies are clear and realistic. The facilities are great, too.

Not unique to the University but payment on-time is difficult to achieve in the gulf. Some faculty have waited 3 months for salaries to be paid. Bonus money is routinely delayed by weeks or months for unknown reasons. Reimbursement for research is routinely delayed by months and never paid promptly. \r\n\r\n-No culture of academics. The students and local faculty all seem to view the university as simply a rubber stamp to get them a higher salary in the job market.

Discussion of religious topics is so taboo as to be almost forbidden. No lesson can openly be critical of the government or it's leadership. If students are critical of their leaders in a class, instructors have to be extremely careful to steer the conversation to other topics. In faculty meetings, even constructive review of the university management is not encouraged or allowed. Faculty can be fired or not have contracts renewed for being vocal about changes they would like to see. This leads to a culture of professors simply keeping their heads down and refusing to address any issues the university faces. This has been exacerbated by the new President. Firings, \"sudden resignations\" and the instatement of Egyptians with no academic credentials has created a culture of fear and distrust at the University. \r\n\r\n-Limited to no research support. The university refuses to purchase access to critical research databases despite ongoing promises. Human subject approval can take weeks. \r\n\r\n-Poor student performance and attitude.

Members of faculty are abandoned by an irresponsible management obsessed with status and hierarchy, and afraid and unwilling to dirty their hands with the reality of the teaching and learning environment. Nobody is happy. And if you dare make a suggestion or give feedback, no matter how tactfully you try, you are blacklisted. You are not here to apply the expertise you demonstrate on your resume. You are here to do what you are told, however objectionable, by people who are often appointed to their positions without qualifications in the field they oversee.

Teaching load kept increasing as well as research expectations and admin obligations, leaving no room for serious scholarship (maybe a way to keep people there since it becomes more and more difficult to get employed somewhere else after working here). The administration has created an environment of fear, threat and anxiety which leads to a quick turnover in faculty, but no one seems to notice or care. People with zero admin experience are placed in positions (e.g. Associate Dean and Dean) where they are literally ruining entire colleges making people resign coz they cannot take the extremely unprofessional, unprecedented and unacceptable behavior anymore.  The management doesn't do anything to support faculty, so it feels more like a trench war between faculty and management. It cannot be that management actually lies to its faculty (even the occasional pay rise does not make this morally right). Faculty should be treated like serious scholars and be trusted as any adult should be trusted.  At times it felt, as if we were controlled/punished like students.

The salary and benefits were adequate. The collective culture felt that we were part of something very important.

The better faculty and leadership left. In their place stepped in less than professional Administrators, Deans and Assistant Deans. There was pressure from a Dean to put his name on professors\" publications with the understanding that it could be tied to renewal. Renewal was not always based on performance. An atmosphere of fear and bullying developed in some faculties. Ethical and promising professors then left. (Indeed, during the last recession, 4 faculty out of a total faculty of 23 resigned without having other positions to move to.) Accreditation projects were assigned where compliance was manufactured and accreditation awarded to the institute and colleges. Accreditors were not given access to all faculty; indeed, some faculty were warned not to talk to accreditors.\r\n\r\nLeadership in some colleges is self-serving (the opposite of the Servicing Leader). Lack of budget and research opportunities were perenial problems. Increasing class load and the pressure to teach over the summer compounded the problems. The benefits and salaries did not keep up with inflation. Poor leadership in the colleges and neopotism within executive leadership also occurred. Deans were not regularly evaluated by their faculty (e.g. a new dean who was threatening and unscrupulous was not evaluated for at least 2.5 years).\r\n\r\nThe promotion process is flawed; some Deans appeal to the Provost to overturn the results of the Promotion Committee. The Promotion Committee reviews the faculty's promotion submission. The faculty portfolio is reviewed by external reviewers. Yet, this can be rejected at the discretion of the Dean and Provost.
