If you're going to work in healthcare in the UAE CCAD is the best place to work. Granted there are issues associated with such a ambitious start up of this magnitude especially implementing western standards in a nonwestern world and trying to standardize SOPs with thousands of employees from all over the world. It could have been a logistical nightmare but they did a good job especially in comparison to other healthcare facilities in the region who have failed and continue to have disengaged staff / high turnover.  I've read how people have commented on tough leadership however I felt the leadership had to be tough based on the expectations and needs of the region. Patients complaining about waiting months for an appointment means reviewing appointment times and making adjustments. Every new start up goes through growing pains and I feel a lot of people had such high expectations without taking into consideration the limits of the region and government posed.  I quite enjoyed my time at CCAD.,0.095891,0.83269006,0.0714189

Previously lived the values and culture of Cleveland Clinic in its early years but has lost its way over the need to align with Emiratisation and make money.  It does not follow it's values any more.  Slash and burn terminations and quick exits have been a common occurrence for the past two years and this is expected to increase in 2018.  started to happen across the nonclinical staff.  No employee loyalty by the employer.  Little to no investment in nonclinical staff  training engagement future career development.  Human Capital are certainly not focused on the Human aspect of HR; or you as the employee more on how can we get the most from you with the least amount of investment.  Morale and staff engagement is at a low as more of the expats are let go to reach the government Emiratisation target.  Expatriate knowledge and expertise is being diluted and lost.  Salaries and allowances are being reduced.  Leave allowances and benefits have been reduced despite contractual commitments.

I worked at CCAD for just over 7 years and found it to be a an amazingly beneficial experience. General pros  can be summarised as 1. Every CIO we have had (from Mike Reagin to Bryan Lord) has been an exceptional technological visionary who has supported individual growth. 2. Excellent work to life balance 3. Great IT leadership fostering a culture of supporting growth from within 4. A supportive model allowing individuals to experience every facet of IT (there was not an area of IT that I didnt have the opportunity to understand) 5. A visionary CEO who understands the role technology has to play in driving the future step changes. Often neglected as only a supportive service line; at CCAD Dr. Suri is a well informed leader who recognises how IT will be the backbone of offering the best healthcare.  6. Plenty of opportunities to network with world class professionals both within and outside of CCAD. 7. An active program for supporting the well being of caregivers. I have personally witnessed the organisation bend over backwards to support a caregivers family by raising his healthcare coverage to support his family.,0.00068831816,0.00062392454,0.9986878

Majority of problems that are addressed to the CEO are eventually ignored.  Gossip central (to find to the top gossip and rumor experts of the hospital you can go to a particular restaurant with shisha in the shopping mall by the hospital!)  Many good doctors and staff have left because of unfairness job duties increasing while lacking proper resources.  Bottom line: if you want to add the company's name to your CV (just like the CEO is before he goes back to his homeland) then you might want to give it a try.

Emiritization love emphasize locals dont work and present us in the worst light(Most of us have been here atleast a year before these guys). If you finish university or get educated and spend time and money certificates they still won't help you get internally appointed or a salary bonus.

The cronyism around the new inexperienced CEO is a joke; too many unqualified and inexperienced people are now leading this once great organisation.  It's a shame that the once great Cleveland Clinic has been downgraded by poor leadership and vision.

Physicianled model a failure in this example. Physician leadership empowers middlemanagement business execs in a Game of Thronestype environment. This negatively affects clinical performance.

I have served for a decade less four years here at CCAD.  I have worked and continue to work with incredible caregivers from different parts of the world. These caregivers have made tremendous efforts and continue to work assiduously to fulfill the mission of CCAD to the UAE community and the region. My remarks therefore represent a majority t of caregivers who feel honored and privileged to be part of this great organization. We have made remarkable achievements in ways that we serve this community in need of quality health care. We have touched so many lives. We have saved many; and undoubtedly we will continue to do so for many years to come.  Recently we have successfully treated and looked after complex patients in need of organ transplantations; performed most complex cardiac brain and abdominal surgeries for hundreds of patients.  In absence of CCAD these patients would have to leave their families and travel thousands of miles across vast deserts and oceans to seek quality health care. Every caregiver from those who greet patients at the entrance to those at bedsides and operating rooms – all have played critical roles in taking care of these patients. As a clinical caregiver I take a pride of such achievements. These are the reasons for most of us to choose a career in healthcare and be part of CCAD family.  The organization continues to grow and plans are in place to add more services such as oncology and few others in order to fulfill our commitment to serve this community in need of quality healthcare.,0.0047990098,0.03999075,0.95521027
I have worked in health care for two decades and I have enough wisdom and experience to say that no hospital is perfect.

Toxic: people badmouth gossip and talk about others a lot here. The whole hospital is far more toxic than any other hospitals I have worked in. I quickly learned that this is due to the toxicity bleeding out from the toxic COS and CMO. Physicians badmouth others at the cafeteria; clinical administrators and nursing directors  an entitled group of people too badmouth and gossip about everyone at the cafe. Stay away from these tables if you want to have a sane working environment. Don't trust even your office mate or share anything with him/her (physicians share office here) as it can reach others. Chiefs are often nice people but can be toxic due to the fear of losing their jobs/being fired by Csuite members. The fear of being fired is palpable here than any other hospitals that I have worked in.   Abusive: Csuite consists of abusive men. The toxicity and abusive natures of your institute are due to these CEO COS and CMO. All three are poor abusive and manipulative men who should not be allowed to lead any hospitals. Most of the achievements of CCAD is due to Ann our previous CNO. It would be a great shame if these three men got the credits for Ann's hard work. They came and introduced 140% booking without recognizing the hardship on the physicians. Physicians accept their topdown policy because they are fearful of losing jobs. These abusive Csuite members think they own you and would easily cut your vacation days so that they can report the right number of visits to Mubadala and keep their ridiculously highpaying jobs. We are forced to increase our surgery cases to appease these men. I have never worked in a hospital where patients are just numbers. You will drag your feet to work after 3 months here.  Highturnover:The Csuite is so abusive that I have seen so many people thrown to the curb or told to resign. People are DISPOSABLE here. They get rid of you very quickly here.Good clinical administrators are substituted by bullies who keep getting promoted by these abusive CEO COS and CMO. Good physicians leave within 20 months or already thinking of leaving after 3 months here. Remember all physicians will go through probation and your job is at the mercy of your chiefs or clinical administrators (who badmouth physicians like it is their second nature). I have seen docs disappearing from their roles very quickly. I am not sure why any docs will want to take the risk of working at this toxic and abusive hospital  imagine leaving your comfortable jobs and home countries and come here and then told to leave within 6 months  what will you do? Imagine the shame!  Docs are paid based on their passports. So be prepared to see Egyptian and Pakistani docs making half of what you make. Americans are worshipped here and some American nurses make more money than the physicians here.  Overall there is no reason to come and work here until Mubadala get rid of the CEOCOS and CMO.

Salaries have been frozen for some years now no longer keep pace with inflation; school fees paid but fees have gone up; accommodation provided but rents are going up every year and accommodation allowance does not.

"People often live in terror of the upper management. No one knows what to expect and the fear of the sack is reinforced by apparently random dismissals.

The job you get hired into may be reclassified downward but no matter how outstanding your work performance you will probably not be rewarded with a promotion.

I would have said that the package was good when it was first instituted 25 years ago.

"New management has done all it can to erase whatever good will staff and faculty may have had with the introduction of polices and procedures that strike at the heart of reciprocal trusting relationships.  Among these include the introduction of biometric clockin/clockout and the counting of hours campuswide CCTV redefining existing contracts to increase faculty teaching load forced overtime and the impossible demand that all degrees  including high school certificates  be attested by state and national governments as a condition for continued employment.   This year onerous exam rules were implemented forcing faculty to submit grades within 48 hours in addition to requiring an adhoc committee to review all A and F marks after which a majority of grades were ""normalized""  by administrative authorities without consultation of relevant faculty.  Communication from management is perfunctory threatening and often has to be clarified by an additional chain of grammatically and orthographically challenged messages.

Absolutely corrupted management. Expats need to understand that the contract that you sign are of no use. HCT is known for not honouring employee's contracts in spite of it being a federal government institute. They can terminate your contract without giving a damn reason since the government policy allows them to do so. BEWARE..!!!    Workload is heavy with biometric attendance tracking. You will be penalized if you miss the biometric checkin / checkout even for a day. CAO HR VPs and the so called President and CEO are totally useless.   HCT is known for cheating faculties by not paying their benefits such as annual leave and overtime. They are have not paid 100s of faculties their performance bonus for the academic year they served before being sacked. There is no worklife balance since you are required to teach anytime between 8:00 AM and 9:00 PM. There is no research facilities or research opportunities.   The beauty of the institute is that final exams are designed for students to cheat and on top students even hack the system and grade themselves.   Housing travel educational allowances  everything has been slashed. Relocation allowance promised by the college was never paid for many faculties.,0.999049,0.00078830967,0.00016270723

"Organizational ""philosophy"" is based around CEO's self aggrandisement. CEO is failed engineer who thinks a series of incomprehensible flow charts = educational innovation.

Corruption and incompetence were rife among both faculty students and management. Just about all faculty members with any integrity and/or competence have left or are actively looking  unless they have a family and are 'trapped' by the minimum 6 month notice clause. Grade inflation is endemic. Middle management plays the race card  depending on the manager some ethnicities are favored over others. In the view of management all students have more credibility than faculty. Outright lies are consistently told by middle management. Upper management have decided that the failings of the system are the faulty of faculty and have taken steps to ensure that all faculty members are present at their desk at least 8 hours per day. There is no privacy  faculty workspaces are part of a wide open plan area and students have unfettered access to this area which makes marking prep and heavens forbid research almost impossible to accomplish whilst at work. This means that most faculty need to work an extra 34 hours per day (minimum) at home to stay on top of all the overly bureaucratic requirements and the 20 teaching hours per week. Security guards roam the corridors checking as to whether faculty are in class at all times. Those who are not are reported to management who will selectively discipline faculty with more than one instance being a sackable offence. Unless of course you are a drinking buddy (or whoring buddy) of management.,0.9987489,0.0011010756,0.0001499833

Do the research I didn't do. You will need at least $20000 to get set up when you arrive. You will need a security deposit of about $1500 real estate agent's fee of about $1500. Electrcity deposit of about $1200. You will need to buy a car which will cost at least $5000. Public transport is nonexistant. You will need home appliances  which will cost $1000's although you migt have a kitchen stove fitted in your home. Most schools have a school uniform unless your kids go to USD so you will need to buy shirts and pants. You will also need to borrow the rent for your home from HCT as  the homeowner expects the whole years rent in 1 check. Look on Dubizzle for rental prices. They are coming down a little but still around $30$35000 for a family home. HCT will cover most of this but you will need to pay something. Youl will need to get all your qualifications attested not just your masters or phd. This means high school diploma bachelors diploma masters and phd if you have one and you will need the transcripts attesting too. This will cost about $2000 if you get an agent to do it. If you don't get it in one year you will fail probation. Working hours are 20 hours a week but they only count a 50 minute period as 50 minutes not one hour so you get 24 contact hours a week plus substitute teaching on top. There is a finger scan machine on each campus to make sure you spend 40 hours a week on the premesis and there is a violations committe for dealing with staff who don't do their hours although there is flextime. Hours range from 8am to 9pm. No one I know teaches all  day but some teach until 9pm at night then again at 8am in the morning. Even with kids I had to teach 3 nights a week till 9pm.  Salaries are generally paid on time and are tax free. The cost of living is at least double. Grocery shopping is really expensive as goods are all imported. Electricy and water cost over $1000 a month plus the housing fee which is a change on top. You will not save much money unless you are a working couple or you have no social life. If you are new expect to be paid much less than old staff and there are no longer any increments for time served.  Most other faculty are friendly and helpful but the vast majority are planning on leaving. Morale is very low. Managment rules by fear of 'serious consequences' and the threat of the violations committe. This is not the dream job I hoped for. HCT is a factory graduating students who don't merit a diploma. The whole culture is about letting students pass with virtually no standards. It seems like it was a good place to work years ago but definitely not now.,0.9975038,0.0023047759,0.00019147513

•	Faculty hours were reduced to 30hrs/w. Nevertheless due to 20h/week teaching load and extra admin duties this did not make any difference to the majority and top management  knew that. If you are assigned an academic administrator duties then this hour reduction doesn’t apply.  •	They reduced the education allowance to 60000AED ($16350) per family with a cap of 45000AED for one child. Last year it was 120000AED. The current allowance is not enough to cover the school’s expensive tuition. You will end up paying from your own packet.  •	As faculty you are responsible for organizing many events every semester. If you don’t this will impact your annual performance and evaluation. •	Your annual performance range is from 1 to 5. Many were rated at 4/5. But the central services (HR) will reduce to 3. Why? So you get a less financial award. •	Don't believe promises made by top management. They can easily change their mind. Example: faculty and fast track promotion.  •	HCT introduced last fall faculty ranking. Many joined in with faculty ranks. When this process was finalized many of them were demoted to a lower rank despite previous promises by the top management to recognize their ranking. For example: a full professor was given an associate professor ranking. This translates to lower pay. •	Many changes occur during the semesters with new rules. New rules are usually determent to faculty.   •	You are required to do invigilations on weekends for final exams and EMSAT. You can claim a day off in lieu before or after ONLY. As long as it doesn’t impact the schedule of classes to faculty. Well you have classes every day of the week. So good luck using it.  •	You must do clockin/clockout. If you are short of few minutes an email will be sent requiring justifications. •	A written warning is given for any mistake you make. This will prevent you from being promoted to higher faculty rank and obtain the annual faulty financial award. •	No job security. Any contract can be and they often are cancelled with 6 months notice no reason needed. If you are not Emirati you will have to leave some day. •	HCT has key performance indicators (KPI) implemented across all departments. You are required to meet the KPIs set by upper management. Failure to do so will impact your performance.  •	Their salaries and benefits are considered the lowest among government universities.  •	You may be assigned to teach in other campuses which requires commuting during rush hours. •	High turn over in employment. Every year many faculty resign.  •	A culture of fear within this organization poor communication and lack of transparency from upper management. •	All faculty are upset and not happy with their work environment. You never hear any compliments about the upper management. •	Ironically the upper management are promoting happiness yet no one is happy. •	Seventy two faculty applied for fasttrack promotion when the new ranking system was introduced only twelve got. Why? The upper management doesn’t have a budget per their claim. They just want the local accreditation to get through. •	Finally this place attracts people who could not get into any of the colleges in their own countries to teach.

You get paid on time (except they break the law on holiday pay: you are supposed to get it before you go on holiday but they operate some crafty scheme and they say it is campus closed day not a holiday. This sums HCT  up in a nutshell.  ),0.9819287,0.017532036,0.00053925946
There are so many I could go on all day but I'll try. They say you teach 15 credit hours. This is equal to 20 contact  don't be fooled. They are short staff so over time erel be compulsory. They will find a way to cheat you often like this: they give you an overtime class they think will be closed but aren't sure. You teach it for 4 weeks then they close it because of a lack of numbers. You don't get paid for part of a course if only runs 4 weeks. Meanwhile you've taught 16 hours of a course and they should have paid you about $1000 which you have now lost. You must get over time authorised by the VC do if you don't then tough if you don't get paid.  Senior management spy on faculty and get security to do likewise. Don't be surprised if you see a security guard looking in on you at 8:01 to check you are there. Don't be surprised if you get summoned to the director's office because the security dropped by your classroom 1 minute before the scheduled end of class but you weren't there. You can't let then leave early even if you've finished everything. You need to plan more just in case. However the students soon realise the idea is to get through the time and but the materials and have hundreds of ways of using up everyone's time. There is flexi time but you can't really use it because everyone used to do there hours and leave early on a Thursday. Now there are compulsory meetings every Thursday just to finish the week of nicely. HCT has a compulsory happiness agenda taken from the government. Every campus tried to outdo each other on happiness initiatives. You will be happy and unhappiness will not be entertained. Be prepared to be happy. Students really are useless. When I say useless I mean completely and totally useless. They have absolutely no idea hire to study and don't care. They have never studied in their lives and aren't going to break the habit of a life time. Creating is rife in exams assignments and projects. Essay mills are making a fortune from these students. If you report them expect to have your integrity question first because you asked it to Halen and you didn't give then enough support to achieve the assignment in the first place. It is never their fault. They are victims of poor teaching.  Grades are often normalised. This is HCT talk for changed. When a large number of students fail it is obviously the fault of the teacher so the grade boundaries are changed even though the students don't know the content.  In order for HCT to climb a university ranking scheme they have decided to increase the number of PhD holders as faculty regardless of where the diploma was issued or how skilled and experienced they are.  This has resulted in highly specialised theoretical professors trying to teach quite genteel courses in engineering IT or business with very little idea on how to teach lie level general themes. You will be lent on heavily if you have a broader background and severely reprimanded for not being a team player if you don't prepare their lessons and hand over lesson plans and power point slides.  You can be asked to teach split shifts and don't think it won't happen to you. Ask for a written guarantee you won't be asked to work more than an 8 hour day and see how far you get. You will have at least one day where you have to work 8 to 6 or 8 or 10 till 8pm and probably 2 days like it. You won't be teaching solidly and they'll say you can clock out and go home but who dies this when you have a2 hour break? Admin and management are generally incompetent. So many positions have been culled it had left the others over worked and with so many people leaving the new ones don't know what to do and leave quite quickly too. Emirati staff on the whole are lazy and useless preferring to drink tea and chat rather than work.  Salary and allowances have not kept pace with inflation. The UAE is expensive with lots of hidden costs. Basic services such as electricity water internet etc are more than double what you pay in the US or UK. Internet is nearly $100 a month for a slow connection.  A good school will cost 80000 dhs a year but HCT will only pay 30000. You have to pay about $15000 a year per child out of your own salary. It's not worth it especially as the schools are quite poor and hire the last experienced (cheapest) teachers possible. This is only the tip of the ice berg.  I could go on and on.

If you want to be treated like a human being with employee rights then this is not the place for you.   They do not respect expertise education contributions ethics or hard work. They do not care how important you think you are. They do not care how many publications you have. If you say one wrong thing to one wrong person you are out. Period. And you have NO employee rights and no recourse.   They are actually now cutting employee benefits. The new housing allowance isn't enough to get a shady dump in the wrong part of town for your family.   They lie about how great HCT is doing. It is all propaganda. In reality teachers are on mandatory overtime (as much as 25 hours facetoface contact time per week). Nobody is allowed any money for professional development opportunities externally. Students are allowed to skip classes or turn in work at such low quality the teacher does not even know how to grade it. Students cheat on papers and exams and teachers are not allowed to fail them. Students do 10% of the work that would be required in the equivalent course in the UK or Canada. HCT shows the accrediting committees all the fancy course outlines and technology. The accrediting committee needs to just test graduates and they will then see the truth: students do not actually learn anything.   Technology implementation is done contrary to every single project management guide on the planet. There are no usability studies. No pilots. Stakeholders are not included in key decisions. Stakeholders do not receive any communication. And teachers must implement the latest technology change quickly or risk losing their job. They change technology on teachers every year or two. Today it is this device. Then tomorrow another one. Teachers are stressed as they keep having to revise all their curriculum for the latest technology change they are required to use.  There are NO chances for advancement. The job you come for is all you will have. You will never get promoted. They will dump more and more responsibility and duties on you but never give you a new title or pay raise. There are no pay raises. Ever. Never. Right now they are firing people and hiring them back for a lower salary and with less benefits (Yes. Really. Remember: no employee rights). The social disparities and racism are rampant on top of that.  It is a culture of fear and negative moral. I would not let my dog work here. This place is toxic. The second I can leave I will.

"I went to HCT with a plan to stay there for about 10 years. After my first week in classes I abandoned that plan and after a month there I questioned whether I'd make it through the initial 3year contract.  I found the daily stress there to be untenable. Not only was I on mandatory overtime (22 contact periods per week  ridiculous in a ""collegiate"" environment – though some colleagues were working up to 25) but they emphasize paperwork/professional development/meetings at the expense of doing a quality job in the classroom.  There were mandatory office hours  85 Sunday to Thursday. In fact when I arrived the mandatory hours were 84 but then we got a new director and assistant director. The ‘Supervisors’ would roam the massive faculty room to ensure all their teachers were at their desks until 5.  All faculty (approx. 70 at FWC) are relegated to one huge room in which they are assigned a workstation with absolutely no privacy. It was noisy as well. Administration insisted that such an environment promoted communication collaboration and coordination (the infamous 3 C's of HCT). They push ""teamwork"" ad nauseam.  Some students were OK while many others were nightmares in abayas. Basically HCT focuses on increasing the student population (thus bringing in more money from the government) resulting in ""students"" who shouldn't be there young ladies who view college as a means of providing a social network. Often classes were out of control  several teachers walked out of their classes during my last semester there including me (twice).  The curriculum went from bad the first year I was there to ludicrous the second year. They switched from an integrated skills curriculum to strands requiring us to teach language skills in separate classes. That curriculum proved to be a debacle.  If you like meetings then HCT is the place for you. As a rule I hate them. I believe that with few exceptions meetings are a waste of time. At a previous college in Saudi Arabia we had one mandatory meeting per month and I found that marginally acceptable. At HCT I had two mandatory meetings per week. That was simply insane.  And the conferences  mandatory mandatory mandatory. And they would punish you if you didn't attend them.  They pushed professional development ad nauseam as well  PEP goals meetings seminars etc. They even went so far as to hire a PD company from the USA to impose PD activities on us. At the first staff meeting for the new year we found ourselves playing in ""teams"" with pieces of rope for about 30 minutes. Again it was insane and a colossal waste of time considering the formidable teaching schedule and new curriculum for which we needed to prepare our lessons.  My first week in the classroom I was observed by my supervisor  and get this it was also my first time with one of the classes. Insanity again!  I got little relief from the stress as work when I went home to my apartment. An Emirati family with two small children lived directly above me and the noise would extend into the early morning hours. I complained to them the apartment manager and HCT for nine months with NO relief.  When you arrive they ""give"" you 30000 dirhams and one week to buy all the stuff for your dwelling. You have to buy everything including kitchen appliances washer etc. Keep in mind that this is a LOAN and it's amortized over the course of your 3year contract. If you resign early you pay back part of that loan. It's not so easy to sell your stuff either unless you happen to be there when new teachers arrive.  I will give them credit for paying me on time every month and for providing me with a decent annual travel allowance (for me about $2800). They were also generous with the gratuity when I left. But that's all the credit I can give them.  Basically HCT was a major disappointment for me. I don't consider them a college. The environment there especially the behaviour of many of the students reminded me of a middle school setting. With HCT it's all about window dressing smoke and mirrors.  Don’t go there.",0.99875295,0.0010885188,0.0001584534
HCT used to have a cadre of colleagues who had been around a number of years people who were wellbalanced knew the system and could offer useful advice guidance and friendship to newcomers.  Sadly few of those people are left and the number of new faculty and staff is overtaking the old resulting in no one quite knowing how things are done how to get them done or whom to turn to for advice.    Until recently HCT offered an attractive benefits package.  But that too is a thing of the past with no housing allowance increase in years (in one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets) education benefits for dependent children slashed to a maximum 60000AED annual (a 50% reduction) and what is likely to be a reduction in annual travel allowances (which have been reclassified but not yet fully explained to faculty – a fine example of the decline in institutional communication and transparency).    HCT contracts used to remain pretty much the same from yeartoyear but these days they are subject to an increasing number of amendments.  It could be that what you sign will be valid for only six months before being amended.  If you refuse to agree to the amendments you may have only a couple of weeks to clear out and find new employment.    Students used to be friendly and amenable but these days seem far more demanding disinterested and less willing to put any effort into their own education.    So far the college continues to pay on time.    The media and marketing departments are doing a great job making the college look good to outsiders.  This is the one huge improvement of recent years that management can rightfully claim as success.,0.9933246,0.0059671216,0.00070839183
It used to be that the chancellor would make it a point each year at the college’s annual conference to personally greet every new hire with a welcome handshake. This practice was discontinued by new management whose first address to faculty included threatening faculty with termination if new expectations went unmet.    Since then the institution has been in decline.  Where a great deal of decision making used to happen at the campus level it is all now tightly controlled by a small circle of people in Abu Dhabi.  The result is a lack of input and control over work by faculty in addition to a knowledge vacuum that fosters rumor and breeds distrust.  Few teachers or staff feel anymore that what they do matters or that management has any concern for their needs or interests.  In fact management seems most concerned with impressing its political bosses which is perhaps why the media and marketing departments have been given so much attention.    The goodwill between management and faculty that used to be one of the more noteworthy features of this institution is long gone and unlikely to ever return – certainly not under the current regime.  There is no longer any local leadership no one who might consider themselves an educator just workers doing jobs hoping not to get the axe and hanging on a year or two or three before happily and relievedly moving on.,0.9976801,0.0021418566,0.0001780814

HCT is a classical example of mismanagement non professionalism and arrogance.   There are 3 major stakeholders of HCT system (a) Faculty (b) Admin (c) Student.   Let me describe my experience with the C stakeholder first. HCT students are full of arrogance and do not feel any hesitation to treat teacher as their personal servants. In the class room students watch movies on computer and if a teacher stops them they will complain the administration that the teacher does not know how to teach and the faculty have to face  unnecessary enquires from the administration.   If a student get failed due to his poor interest in study the blame will be on teacher. The students uses bulling and other tactics to disrespect the teacher. It is a reality that even some female students do not feel ashamed to blame teacher for harassing. The academic background of HCT students is highly poor.  Those who enroll for undergraduate degree have IQ level below than 8grade students. After studying a course for almost six months students even can not define the course. The students have highly poor knowledge of Math and English subjects.   The administration lives in stone ages and treat faculty as a salve. It is common in HCT  that you go to take class and then you got a notice from HCT administration that you are fired and there is no need to come tomorrow. In my 3 years stay I personally witnessed 3 cases. Even a minor human mistake from a faculty can be the reason of firing.  The admin use any stupid clause to fire you. A faculty has to survive between students and administration stupidness. The more you are incompetent the more chances you carry to survive.  There are many faculty members in HCT roughly 30% who have bogus degrees and by buttering the top management they are surviving.  These individuals carry no knowledge about subjects. They keep students happy by awarding them good grades and are ready to be exploited by the students. Hitherto these are the more successful individual in HCT. You will be surprised to know that most of the people who have bogus degrees are holding key management positions that range from HoD to Deanship of a department.,0.99679106,0.002929093,0.00027984983

"HCT treats trained academics like janitors and worse. It is the most demoralizing company I have ever worked for. Academics are not valued. The entire ""school"" is a scam. There is no education taking place here. It is all smoke and mirrors: People who pretend to be professors pretending to teach people who pretend to be students. If you are truly an academic have any selfworth or integrity and if you care about your career in academia then DO NOT accept a job at HCT. You will be lied to abused cheated and in the end no other institution will take you seriously because HCT is a joke. If there were a special Olympics for academia HCT would not be rigorous enough to qualify. It's that bad.   HCT does not honor its contracts so do not expect your compensation to in any way reflect your contract. HCT will simply modify your contract whenever and as often as it likes. In five years my contract has been modified over a dozen times. I am currently earning roughly half of what I earned when I started. HCT not only slashes your salary once you come on board it also slashes benefits and allowance (housing travel schooling...).  HCT promotes Emiratis and Jordanians based on nepotism and wasta (contacts) rather than merit or qualifications. All of the directors are Emirati and most only hold a bachelors degree (from HCT!). It's sad. If you complain in any way management threatens you and you become a target for harsh discriminatory retaliation.

"I have lived in many parts of the world but without question HCT is the most unethical and dysfunctional organization I have ever worked for.  I personally witnessed the following:  contracts and written policy ""directives"" arbitrarily and constantly being changed without notice resulting in employees losing jobs being demoted or given reduced wages without warning;  faculty not being provided with enough sick leave for effective medical care (to the point where one individual was forced to return to work one week after cancer surgery with visible stitches); employees being essentially forced to take overtime but then not being paid the promised resulting wages; students being unable to graduate due to sudden policy changes that were enacted without notice and then rescinded later; continually shifting calendar dates registrar requirements physical spaces HR policies management positions platforms resources and staffing. Research is impossible due to the high teaching hours and mindnumbing repetitive processes. Even the simplest academic systems which at other organizations are set and functional become convoluted and incomprehensible at HCT.  The people who remain here happily are often those who originate from even more chaotic parts of the world or who thrive on regimentation.

My main problem is the salary scales and the racial profiling that isn't even hidden when decided staff salaries. Western employees doing the same role as a South Asian employees are sometime earning 4 times the salary for exactly the same role  its very unfair. The changes in bonus structure for no reason and with no warning are also unacceptable.  There is also as mentioned in other reviews a strong tendency to openly favor some staff members to encourage internal politics and bullying in the work place. This does not help a work force that are already stretched and stressed.   The products on sale are also poor. Student reviews can be found on other sites  but selling coal for the price of a diamond is a difficult thing to do even for an experienced sales person  which is the majority of the work force at Hult.,0.99885833,0.0010005643,0.00014112485

"I left the company after 1 year and 3 months for another opportunity in my city but I had the pleasure to lead and develop an excellent and successful team within recruitment. Hult offers a truly entrepreneurial and international job with lots of flexibility and room for creativity. I felt like I owned my product/region and had the trust of the management to set my own structure and direct my team towards set targets and KPIs (and the same ownership mentality goes for any role and position in the organization including the more junior ones).   On the other hand any job at Hult is rather intense and does require highly driven and result oriented people with a ""nothing is impossible"" mentality otherwise you will not like it. But for the right profile Hult is more than just a job or school it offers a cool and exciting lifestyle where you get to travel and see the world while having fun with other excellent colleagues with similar ambitions. It also offers you a true family and friendly environment where you feel a part of the team.  At Hult hard and successful work does not go unnoticed and it is most often highly rewarded as your career development can go much faster than in a more traditional/conservative company. In addition it is not a secret that in many countries former Hult (or EF Group) employees are known for being brilliant and hard working people with an eye for business development in international and demanding environments hence also being attractive candidates for future employers.",0.0014073087,0.0049285777,0.99366415

Upper administration is chasing international ratings; good faculty are leaving; ratings are heading down. Graduate school can't execute admissions on a timely manner. HR department which is the most heavily Emiratized and least capable dominates the university.

No tenure; which makes deans and department heads vulnerable and unwilling to stand up for what's right. Procurement/purchasing dept is unable to do simple purchases before the time is up.

" Certain members of the staff are not responsive to emails and late in meeting deadlines.  Some professors could be considered to deal poorly with students. Sometimes the motivation is rather to promote oneself rather than produce knowledge and enable people to learn.  The registrar office is quite often unable to meet deadlines. For example a simple 1minute forms has to be ordered at least two days ahead.   The career office is very weak in helping students reaching employers. At the same time it is not always encouraged for students to go for research or professional internships. Many such opportunities are not also communicated to students.   International female students have been reported to the institute's administration for their ""inappropriate"" clothing such as showing the knees or the arms and likelihood to call the student and scold her.

Poor management high expectations to work lots of overtime with no compensation. So while your contract may state you are to work 42 hours a week expect to work much much more with no compensation. Extremely political with a view to keep Tamkeen happy but no one else. Very little transparency on anything. For example while they published the policy on yearly raises they set it up so that it could not be downloaded. Seriously we all know how to screenshot. Too much gossip very little stays confidential HR clearly does not understand their clientele. For example they  sent a very complicated survey about the role of HR but  filled with it with HR jargon clearly indicating that they  do understand that for most employees English is a second language. Honestly it was insulting.,0.9986456,0.0011856693,0.0001686535

You are very far away from all the competition and innovation in the US in the labs of NYU New York   NYUAD is still in its early phases as a research institution so some departments still lack enough faculty with diversity in research. There is more emphasis on hiring faculty with experience in certain departments.   There is no appreciation of the role of the postdocs in the institution. There is a much stronger emphasis on any role in contact with students. It is obvious in the structure of the benefits salaries.. postdocs are in the bottom tiers.,0.9984541,0.0013874136,0.00015849092
Pay and benefits for staff are in general quite good. The laboratories are new and very wellequipped. A lot of the people were great to work with. Opportunity to work with some talented researchers. Despite the frustrations working here even for a few years is a very interesting experience.,0.00036788237,0.001148346,0.99848384
NYUAD was so promising; I'm really disappointed that it turned into a nightmare after the opening of the new campus. Bureaucratic interference and the sheer incompetence of upperlevel management especially within their government partner company constantly hindered the progress of the staff who were trying their hardest to make the laboratories a success for the researchers. The staff were constantly frustrated with the difficulty of making real progress and the work of the researchers they supported suffered.,0.99873716,0.0010878379,0.00017495979
Salary is the only pro.,0.0011045155,0.993046,0.0058495803
Never do your postdoc in the biology/chemistry program there. Never do your postdoc there. Nobody of the faculty students core staff wants to work or support you but everyone wants to be on your paper for nothing after you did their job! Most PIs have insufficient knowledge and act like dictators with their own ethics and rules for science. Everything is set up in a way that postdocs have to do everything (including writing proposals and the major work for the capstone projects of students) but have no right to claim credit for their work and ideas. Also be aware that most people at this institution do not care about safety and you will probably risk your own health. If you are not really interested in science and would like to have temporary a higher salary than this institution is the right one to experience the modern way of doing science and postdoc slavery. If you are interested in science want to keep your dignity and want to have a scientific career never join this institution as a postdoc!!!,0.9983529,0.0014864082,0.00016076196

"The fact that nothing has been done to the university college management despite numerous complaints both to HC and publicly on sites such as this is a slap in the face to all of those faculty that were sacked last year for no reason and for the rest of us that are stuck here literally hiding in our offices to remain off of the dean's radar. As another poster said it is clear that nobody really cares about the faculty and students in UC. Rumor has it a couple of other faculty members pulled ""runners"" recently and many more including myself have discussed leaving in January. Assuming that hiring is still pathetic thanks to a complete lack of referrals that the uni used to rely on along with this website next semester's scheduling will be laughable for those of us that remain. I envision classes of 40 students and the dean threatening to sack anyone that complains. Unfortunately because salaries at ZU are paltry compared to the actual cost of living here it is just not worth it anymore to remain in such an unethical and dehumanizing work environment. Even some of the UC chairs have jumped on board and are abusing their faculty to protect themselves it is ridiculous.",0.99881834,0.0010444347,0.00013713256
I work in the Academic Bridge Program (foundation year) at the  Dubai campus.  Management treat faculty with respect and as professionals (something not common in the GCC). Lots of development opportunities in curriculum design technology and assessment etc  Students are nice and not on a power trip as they are in some institutions and even if they were the management address issues fairly.    If you are familiar with working conditions in the GCC then this is most definitely the best place to work.  If you're coming from a western country please know what to expect by reading up or you will be disappointed by expectations generally.

Too many to mention here have a look at previous reviews and it says it all. Hopeless management completely authoritarian with no questions asked  please avoid if you have any sense of selfworth or an opinion on how things should be done. Your experience and knowledge is not needed here just kowtow to the deans and you will be fine. Most good people have either left or got fired because they had the guts to stand up and fight those left well they are the dregs and probably couldn't get a job with the stain on ZU on their cv. Psychology one of the most popular majors has been completely decimated by incompetent admins the best faculty left or are now leaving and what is left leaves much to be desired. Faculty who take on admin roles are terrified that if they return to faculty they will be fired for lack of collegiality.

"It's getting more difficult to teach as the class size has increased and the overall English proficiency levels of the students have dropped to the toilet. Faculty have to be concerned about the score of the utterly useless SELE (students' evaluation of teacher). A belowaverage score can cost you your job if you are not among the favored. If you treat students nicely (give grades generously ignore rampant plagiarism allow them to use cell phones when class in session etc ) you will get good SELE score. My SELE was always below the average because every semester one two or three students who have been disciplined and got low grades would choose ""very dissatisfied"" which draged the score all the way down. Using SELE to assess faculty performance is SERIOUSLY FLAWED.  Another problem here is the UC administration. Yes itself is the source of the problem because it is run by the few who are arbitrary and capricious. It is ironic when the faculty teach issues like ""bully"" we are actually the victims of the very thing we try to make our students be aware of. It is ironic when the Dean complimented UC as an entity filled with collegial harmony she then threatened a faculty in her office with terminating her contract if she....

as the ABP (english foundation) program is about to close there is a lot of confusion and anxiety. a lot of people handed in their resignation letters this week. it is confusing because the students we teach are barely able to speak or read a simple sentence in English so it is absurd to think there will even be a university left after our program shuts down. people are sad especially those of who have been here over a decade.  the other main problem here is HR which has lost all its good employees and managers. landlords do not have a good reputation here. rents are rising fast (25% a year) but our salaries have been raised by 2% in five years. when you move out a villa expect to be presented with a huge bill for damages you did not cause. and don't expect HR to lift a finger to help you. all they do is withhold your money at the end.,0.9990427,0.0007989571,0.00015823492

The money. That was the only thing I could hold onto towards the end. There was no real work in class. The students can barely write and have minimal reading comprehension.

HR does not exist. Do not rely on them for anything. The last hiring committee I sat on had ZERO Western applicants. No one with any qualifications will apply there and once in a blue moon when a qualified candidate applies the administration will lie outright to get them to take the position. I was offered a 3 year contract. When I arrived it had been altered to a 4 year contract. There was no negotiating it back to the agreed upon 3 years. The options I was offered were: take the 4 year contract or leave. You have to give 67 months notice to leave unless you bolt. If you bolt you forfeit your contract bonus. So it has been very challenging for faculty to find jobs. You give notice either hoping you can find something or you find something and hope they will hold it for you.,0.9985524,0.0013143566,0.00013314784

Senior management.... plain and simple they don't have a clue how to run a university and treat faculty with such disrespect it is hard to explain how bad it actually is.  Decisions are made without any consideration of the effect they may have those who toady up to Deans are rewarded and those who fight back are punished with with the most petty of means.  Most Deans are interim because they can't attract anyone good enough to take the position full time so the place continues to sink to ever lower levels because the interim Deans are hopeless and not qualified to do the job often appointing their friends without any respect for due process. Faculty who have been there for a while have developed a siege mentality the place is depressing and the sad part is that it doesn't have to be that way..... five years ago ZU was awesome now it is easy to see it will only get worse unless someone has the guts to fire ALL senior managers and start again.,0.9981755,0.0015909408,0.00023353855

Does not have an atmosphere of competition  and politics like many universities. Nice work space but unstable job security so at all levels people are afraid to make change so don't try. The university receives lots of community support and is financed by the UAE government. Great Facility and potential but really needs a TOP DOWN vacuuming of dead weight. Management and administration should be recruited with the same diligence and requirements as the experience and certifications required of  staff instructors faculty and general workers. There are cafeteria workers with higher qualifications than Department Chairs Deans or Assistant Provosts NO JOKE! Salaries remain private :) but you'll be shocked to discover that at all levels workers are paid differently one coworker doing the same job as you will make twice as much salary while another coworker that has been there for 10 years makes LESS! NO Kidding! Salary is based on what was negotiated at the start  market demand at the time you were hired.

Negotiate a good contract because your salary won't increase and promotions and increased  workloads come  with announcements and applause but without pay or incentives. There is a double standard in almost everything. Management is often underqualified unaccountable and appointed. Unlike most accredited universities management often hold only a bachelors or masters. Department Chairs and Deans little teaching often no research experience and frequently unimpressive credentials. In contrast other employees are often over qualified. Instructors are given heavy teaching loads with prescribed curriculum and little or no research or preptime. Workload is not comparable to other universities standard in most countries is 12 hours (3 classes) depending on the Department  typical workload is (4 classes) some 5. Class sizes are large and annual reviews are based on employee cost and student popularity. Classes are often taught by adjuncts with little or no experience in the area they teach. Workers are expected to stay on campus all day holiday or not. Administration can take holidays whenever they want and are also gone during school breaks. The provost position changes frequently  so does the university's goals. Replacing the top person has allowed for a very heavy layer of administration and management personnel simply staying doing little work and taking all the money they can. After all new provosts won't fire someone immediately and are often replaced before they realize any issues.  There is no union or complaint mechanism for workers nor is there tenure options for faculty thus those that are happy to make good salaries attempt to keep students happy by requiring little effort  minimizing work load and stay. Those with subject specializations grant publishingresearch interests unique skills or are marketable and have the ability to receive grants tenure and achieve career progression at equitable or better salaries elsewhere  tend to leave. In other words those with specialized skills credentials or active career goals LOOK ELSEWHERE.,0.9976788,0.002059555,0.0002616845

The lowest salaries and highest stress levels in the region. If you’re in University College (UC) or you’re a professor in the majors the majority of the students expect you to do the work for them in every manner imaginable.

The educational “standards of learning” (ZULOS) are mapped out in endless committees and meetings...yet most students pass the “academic” courses literally without reading anything and very often by writing next to nothing.

A lot of time invested in projects requested by admin who then just seem to lose interest or move into a different direction so the work is no longer needed.

Salary is still good . However  from what I understand after I left the summer vacation was cut short by about  7 weeks and everyone will now have to do summer school or 'busy work' for no extra pay so in effect I think this is about a 5 % pay cut. Up until summer 2019 there were wonderful long summer vacations of 10  12 weeks (depending on  Eid tagging on) and summer school was an optional extra that a lot of people wanted to do because it was paid pro rata and they still got a good long vacation.   Good opportunities for in house PD though attendance funding for TESOL Arabia was  cut. You could really feel the cutting back over the last few years I was there.

No salary rises for several years unless you were on a very low point on the scale. Going over to cash housing (as opposed to uni paid housing where ZU took on the tenancy) meant that unless you are a couple with no children  (families with kids really came out badly)  you might find that you would have to go for an inferior apartment (the decrease in rents in Abu Dhabi however did make going on to cash housing beneficial  to some people as they could pocket the difference). Cash housing also means you are liable for the municipality charge added on to the electricity and water bill every month.  With a couple of exceptions I didn't find colleagues particularly friendly or supportive  you only really met people in your own department unless you were a smoker. Apparently the smokers corner is the place to meet people and socialize  and I even heard of nonsmokers dropping in to get the latest gossip.  HR (human capital) is a nightmare. Nasty and unhelpful people who think you should be beholden to them and that they are doing you a special favour. One colleague dubbed them 'sub human' resources  even lower than 'inhuman resources' that they were often called.  We often wondered why we weren't asked to rate them as all the administrators  professors and teachers have to be by their peers or students. But I think the rating would be so low as to be an embarrassment to the university.  Students are mostly nice enough but in what was ABP before it morphed into something else it was difficult to motivate them. The English entry level to the uni is now supposed to have been raised so maybe not having those very low level students will make a difference. I found when I was there a lot of  students did everything possible to get out of doing any work but wanted the maximum grades. You kind of get into the way of how it is in the Gulf grade adjustments so even weak students pass etc.   There is also a huge move towards catering for special needs students so teachers who have no experience of this are often obliged to have one or two special needs students in their class with very little back up. Having had this more often than not it has been both good and bad  I enjoyed trying to help my special needs students but I would say I would spend on average about 3 hours a week extra catering to their needs  and it is the luck of the draw whether you get them or not (though if you have done a good job you are more likely to get a special needs student again  so maybe don't do a good job if you think it a burden!)  I might add that when I left in May 2019 it was the biggest cohort of leavers ever  across both AD and Dubai campuses. I wonder if this is significant!,0.9928725,0.006910902,0.00021665097

I went there because of the students who are the best thing about the university.  I also found colleagues who were there for a purpose:  to provide the best education possible for the young women of the UAE (now including men).  The vision of the university was a challenge and like most visions slightly out of reach but something you wanted to keep working toward.  I found the faculty and midlevel staff worked extraordinarily hard with virtually no reward or even acknowledgment.

What I found was goodold boys who ran the place.  Provosts came and went with varying degrees of competence ranging from micromanagers to great ideas but little common sense to wanting to remake the university into one like one in the US.  Only one really had insight into the Emirati culture.  But none quite knew how to set goals to work toward the vision partly (and realistically) hampered by the federal government's attitude toward higher education and the penchant of the country's leaders to always think the grass was greener...somewhere else.  There was little if any trust of anyone but the inner circle.  Some were behind the scenes controllers or backstabbers if need be and they tended to get rid of anyone who disturbed their apple cart.  There was a Board of Visitors (BOV) (now defunct) from the US who advised the president but while wellmeaning were led into believing what the inner circle wanted them to believe.  The university suffered from leadership changes which created new colleges new institutes new whatevers leading to expenditures beyond the capacity of the funding.  It has seemed to me that the university was caught between the Sheikh's vision of a research university and the ability of the various provosts to know how to accomplish that.  Certainly now the university has its faculty in a Catch22 of teaching on a par with a small community college while expecting research like a toptier research university.  No university can sustain that and maintain both teaching and research standards.    When the university was created it was based on the US model of higher education and funding was excellent.  However the BOV also based salaries on US universities of comparable size completely ignoring the reality of living and working in the UAE.  This has led to ongoing problems as noted in other reviews and when the unlimited funding was stopped by the Ministry of Finance the university slipped into an ongoing downward cycle of trying to work toward the vision without the financing essential to achieving it by eating its own seedcorn as it were.  Once again the university is in upheavalthe new president has been replaced after implementing questionable policies and practices.  Perhaps the next president a highly respected member of the Sharjah royal family will be able to turn all this around but she will need the wisdom of Solomon and the active backing of the Nahayan family.,0.9942695,0.005555859,0.00017455811
I was at Zu from August 2013 until May 2019. I started as Assistant Professor in Psychology. I couldn’t have been better received and my time at Zu was a remarkable positive experience. I need to emphasize the extreme support each college and the Research Office gives to all faculty. Whether we are talking about research projects publications conferences workshops the financial support is like nowhere else. During my time there I presented papers at several conferences all over the world (US Australia South Africa Turkey Japan...) i accompanied students to present their research (US and Canada) I had the privilege of enrolling in the Innovative Teaching Practice Certificate and others at the CEI I started and finished the International Faculty SoTL Leadership Program (a ZU partnership with The University of British Columbia and others. I got support from statisticians research assistants. Everything I needed to teach and do research at least in my field was there. I’ve seen the Department of Psychology grow more and more each year. I started at Zu with the Psychology and Human Services Program and became Assistant Chair when we were ready to launch the Psychology Program. Couldn’t be prouder of the program department students colleagues college and university who supported this important endeavor. Students now have a pure PSY credentialed program at Zu. Furthermore I couldn’t see it launched but participated in the Masters Program draft. Soon it will be up and running allowing our students to have all the practice knowledge background they need to work as psychologists in the UAE one day. I repeat I couldn’t be prouder. It is fair to bring also all the facilities and extra support you find at Zu: the IT department is just amazing you get all the top IT materials you need and assistance too always ready to help; facilities are beautiful and makes you wanting to be at work; you can even use the gym and classes provided (as I did during lots of lunch breaks). Zu pampers you with lots of initiatives organized both by students and faculty with research opportunities for undergraduates graduates and faculty. Financially speaking you get allowance for housing fees plane tickets health insurance. What else? I could continue on going. This was definitely the best place I have ever worked in. I had to leave because of family reasons and it was the hardest decision I ever had to make. In the end I didn’t say proper goodbye to everyone as I feel I will be able to go back one day. As of now I know the Psychology Department has the best faculty who are research active have the best teaching practices always thoughtful and caring about students. We also have the best students who I remember everyday. With lots of them Im still in contact. Whoever reads this I hope I was able to show how happy and accomplished I was at the Department of Psychology College of Natural and Health Sciences and Zayed University.

The university has completely collapsed in the past few years. Claims that the university’s problems are due to staff shortages from unprecedented growth and faculty discontent stems from expats not understanding the culture are simply lies.  Do your research  the previous president went on a rampage and was fired or rather silently moved to another plush government job. In the aftermath incompetent administrators continue to literally rip everything apart in an attempt to placate higher powers who obviously don’t know what they want.  Administrators deans chairs and managers are mostly unqualified puppets barking orders and have absolutely no understanding how to manage people let alone run a university. They are now hiring anyone with a pulse so don’t expect anything to get better.  The quality of the undergraduates is atrocious; indifferent and illprepared students who blatantly cheat and plagiarize. The courses I taught were continually “dumbed down” so everyone could pass. These programs cannot even be compared to real accredited degrees.  In fact they don’t even measure up to high school diplomas.  I’m amazed that they’ve been able to hang on to accreditation but according to all the rumors seriously doubt they have done so legitimately.  Pay and benefits have seriously eroded and have not kept up with the high cost of living in the UAE. Forget savings especially if you have children as school fees subsidies no longer cover costs.  The tyrannical push for faculty to publish research to improve rankings is comical especially given that NO support is offered.  I was personally embarrassed to affiliate myself with this “university”.   Colleagues tended to fly under the radar and managed to do the minimal amount possible out of fear or indifference.  Morale is low and the environment is toxic.

Owing to terrible staff morale deep unhappiness and resulting high staff turnover ZU is continuously seeking staff to work in its mirage in the desert we like to call a University.  The following criteria are deemed essential for upcoming revolving door positions.     1.     Candidates must be docile meek and highly deferential to incompetent line managers.  These managers are generally less qualified than you have zero management training frequently dismal research records become malevolent if you ever disagree with them and have been selected solely on the basis of their unwavering loyalty to the Dean.  2.     Candidates are advised they must dispense with any old fashioned notions that they are important and valued by management.  Our HR practices revolve around Stalin’s dictum of ‘no man no problem’ (yes that is the Russian dictator). In the interests of gender equality this applies to women also.  3.     Candidates must understand and accept from the outset that their respective Dean is Gods representative on earth and his/her divine will must be done at all times.  It is irrelevant if your Dean lies constantly promotes only their friends lacks any genuine integrity bullies staff is despotic and couldn’t manage a pizza order properly not to mind manage people.  4.     Candidates must be willing to ship their integrity  sense of fairness and all ethics back to their country of origin on taking up the position. ZU will however not pay for any associated shipping costs.  5.     Candidates must have a strong stomach for nepotism blatant favouritism and bullying and be willing to ignore instances of the above especially when they negatively affect hard working and excellent colleagues.  Representatives from the University’s happiness committee will however try to make you feel better by giving you a happy face sticker.  6.     Candidates must understand that ZU is primarily only about ‘presentation’.  If the building is shiny and bright then the place must be amazing right?  Employees must answer in the affirmative at all times to this question.  7.     Candidates must understand that their three/four year contract is in fact meaningless.  You will endure an annual faculty review assessing your performance by your incompetent line manager based on goalposts that shift like the sand outside your cell (office) window and whatever is flavour of the month.  In addition your Dean will override this system in the interests of promoting their personal brand of nepotism.  8.     Candidates must be world class researchers but also excel at teaching advising serving the community being on multiple committees and being innovative.  Suboptimal performance in any of these categories will result in your immediate deportation as we believe these are things you can achieve over night by merely willing them into existence.  After all God created the universe in a mere six days.  9.     Candidates must be aware that the greatest sin that can be committed is a perceived lack of collegiality.  This can be avoided by always saying ‘yes’ no matter what turning a blind eye to blatant abuses of power and position never disagreeing with management and stroking our infantile egos on a constant basis.  Please remember your employers have very thin skins.  10.  Candidates must be aware that the University has zero real interest in staff development or staff retention.  Irrespective of your abilities and accomplishments management reserves the right to get rid of you for any reason we invent at any time (particularly if we suspect you don’t think we are amazing).   11.  Candidates must continuously stress themselves with innovation.  This is an important KPI dreamed up by an important person in senior management in the hope that someone will develop a better mousetrap.   12.  Candidates must understand that the majority of students have very poor English have minimal interest in learning and that attendance at University is a way of getting out of the house to hang out with their friends before they get married off.  Our students like to regularly visit one of the several beauty parlours in the University so  please ensure that assignments do not negatively impact on this important activity.  Also note that the university bookshop closed down due to a lack of student interest in actual books.   13.  Candidates must not overtire students and certainly never upset delicate student sensibilities.  Never suggest that things in the country are anything other than perfect and please limit all assignment activities to an eight grade level and a workload of half a page maximum.   Please provide students with a nap in class as required.  14.  Finally candidates are advised that all of the above criteria for a successful candidate are endorsed by senior management whose preferred management style is creating an atmosphere of fear and intimidation and by promoting those that excel at these activities.      Candidates who are desperate washed up or have nowhere else to go and who meet the above criteria and accept our way of doing things are strongly encouraged to apply.  Candidates are also kindly asked to interpret the negative reviews on this website as ‘lurid fiction’ by the disgruntled and place their trust in the albeit few positive reviews (which have been written by members of our HR department with really poor English ability).,0.99417347,0.005367904,0.00045865888
Coworkers are generally friendly and cooperative. Students are usually respectful and positive. The building facilities are spacious and there is plenty of office space. Overall employment is stable and designed specifically as a teaching college. Therefore if you wish to focus on teaching and have others design the curriculum this is a good place to go  work leave with a nice salary. Great place to teach for people who have already retired never had a job or for those without the qualifications to work at universities elsewhere.   The frequent movement and rehiring of old adminstration in the same position with or without a new title is a unique advantage for management seeking work at this university. So it appears possible with the right contacts to come make good money leave and expect to return 3 to 6 years later at a higher salary.   Friends and networking are held in high esteem and a definite advantage when seeking employment  at ZU . Consequently  you will find groups of expats that worked elsewhere across the globe successfully having friends hired to work with them at ZU. So in various departments you will find large numbers of Indians British or Turkish expats for example that are 'old friends and neighbors'.   For those that have retired and are simply seeking an income this is a wonderful place to work as there are many who are well past retirement age at ZU.,0.0002769121,0.0005178657,0.9992053
"Salaries are not transparent or based on work experience. So you will see people working side by side making completely different incomes and with completely different benefit packages. Also what you are hired at is basically what you are getting on your last day whether it be 13 6 or 9 years later.  Although there is rhetoric about research it is actually frowned upon in some departments at this university. Few actually do research and those that do it keep it hidden. There is a visible class system between management and faculty. Everyone is on limited contracts and are afraid to complain. So you see management''s secretaries using the latest computers for emails and faculty carrying around 10 year old laptops they are expected to use for everything.   Unfortunately there are also Deans  Chairs and Academic Management going up to the highest levels with no academic experience or credentials thus there is little understanding of the facilities  technology budgets or skills needed in today's teaching and research environment. For new comers it is a surprise to find that upper management has no real degree and has never published or is often unskilled and not knowledgeable in the areas they oversee.   Thus you see things like  a dean  promoted from assistant secretary to full professor with no teaching experience or research experience. How do they do the job? By hiring unskilled educators at low salaries with the expectation that people will be grateful and nonchallenging . At the same time firing highly qualified or skilled faculty because they are 'too active too popular with students or are involved with community or research activities that could distract from their teaching duties"".   A sure way lose a position at ZU is to publicly state that something is not working or needs to be changed. Anything that may reflect negatively on a superior is viewed as an unacceptable topic to discuss publicly.   In other words employees are expected to work but not outshine  their superiors or question decisions.   In some ways this makes ZU an ideal if boring place to work or go to school. Those that are  satisfied with doing the minimum  and can remain agreeable to all requests will find it a pleasant place to work will  often  stay through and past standard retirement age.   In this manner you find inadequate management staying for years without any  real scrutiny of qualifications or assessment of work from employees often once in administration moving up the ladder quickly then sitting (literally sleeping) taking advantage of numerous medical enhancing services etc without any accountability. Although employees will whisper about bosses who never come to work or teachers that don't come to class or who only chat with students but don't expect any work they don't complain loudly or too frequently.   Publicly there are sometimes attempts to show change reports are given out and announcements made. For the public there is change as at the highest levels there is often a turnover however the primary positions seem to rotate between a few people who come work a few years then leave only to return a few years later in the same position at a higher salary. Thus it appears more like the reshuffling of people rather than any real change occurring. A good example of this is in the frequent turnover of provosts.    ZU offers no tenure or job security so if someone does for any reason make a superior unhappy there is little chance of remaining employed. This fosters fear in employees and bullying behavior amongst administration that face no penalty for acting inappropriately . The status quo for middle  management is to support lower management and upper management to support middle management  so no questions asked .",0.99744666,0.0022324268,0.00032091257

You will be treated as disposable garbage as a faculty member (and that includes senior faculty such as full professors in the senior colleges). You will be discriminated against if you are not of Arab ancestry (and Gulf Arabs ascend the highest pedestal without reproach or accountability)  receiving higher salaries and preferential treatment. NonArab Muslims treated just as poorly as nonMuslim expats so don't expect that to help. Senior administration and federal bureaucracy seek to Arabize the university through ethnic cleansing. Each year for the past three years over 10% of the faculty quits but administration is happy to see them go and makes zero effort to retain nonArab faculty.   Student enrollment is down. The budget is being slashed with cuts to health benefits housing technology conference travel etc. All faculty expected to be on campus four days per week with six hours of office hours plus many more hours of service and senseless committees. Don't even think of getting any serious research done at ZU. Surveillance cameras everyone on campus creates an Orwellian atmosphere of fear. Age discrimination as faculty nearing 60 years old only receive oneyear contracts as a matter of federal policy. Rampant cheating among the students as the administration turns a blind eye; ZU is a diploma mill for Emiratis. Onerous and expensive attestation and equivalency processes for expats along with HIV and TB tests upon arrival on campus to insult you as untrustworthy and dirty. The President of the university (who is a shaikha) does not have a PhD or any experience in higher education so the institution is haphazardly and chaotically mismanaged with no innovation or vision.,0.99898213,0.0008698875,0.00014795584

I have resigned from teaching at Zayed University after a long period of service in two different units. For my first years it was a wonderful place to be part of. Having taught previously in similar universities (Western style universities in nonWestern countries) Zayed University was in a different league with excellent resources students and colleagues. The past three years have seen standards drop dramatically the arrival of a different and unfriendly management style and team and generally unhappy working conditions.,0.92574984,0.07065008,0.003600134
The main problem sadly is money. No one goes into teaching for money of course but salaries have remained stagnant for the past five years while living costs in Dubai have escalated. Children's school fees in decent private schools for example have doubled in that time. Rent price increases are some of the highest in the world. Class sizes increase year on year. I was considering renewing my contract this year but chose not to when my salary was only increased by 500 AED (about 100 pounds). This has meant many people like me simply have no choice but to leave even if we wish to stay.  Second as many people have already noted on this site the management has become aggressive and unprofessional. Shouting is common. The pressure is unnecessary and reflects in my view how the recent leadership team is inexperienced.   Third I too have been very shocked to see how Human Resources (which is very important in this kind of workplace where most employees are foreign nationals) has collapsed and no longer serves the university community.

"To get an idea of this university you need to know the foundations of the university. The university was originally a state run university. Recently as this has been happening in UAE in general the family of the country have been privatizing government owned properties as they are the ruling family members. The sons of the king have taken over the university as a way to make money off of tuition therefore you can see that the main objective of this ""public"" university is driven by making profits any way they can. This includes squeezing employees of any work they possibility can provide and trying to nickle and dime them out of any money they might give them as a salary.   This said let me explain to you why I give this University a one star rating. Let us start off by saying that when I originally started working in 2010 I was promised several things including a furniture allowance (notably not enough to furnish a 2 bedroom house) free health care (don't go the the hospital if you do not have anything worst than a common cold if you want to live) dental (which is actually good) and housing (which is okay); and finally a salary. These were actually verbal promises and that is where I made a grave mistake the salary promised to me was substantially different from when I actually got there. Keep in mind that this was sent to me directly from HR but upon arrival after I had shipped my furniture and my car and MY ENTIRE LIFE to the UAE from the U.S. (including quitting my old job and screwing over my chair which was actually nice doing) I was screwed over by the HR. I was given a salary approximately 30 percent lower than was was promised. I argued and argued but could not change this.. I was forced to take it or leave. So i accepted.   Working for the University and trying to make suggestions to management is like speaking down a black hole they love sucking in all the comments and suggestions from you but where do these suggestions and comments end up?? No one knows.... I'ts like the placebo affect you feel so good giving your suggestions but when you find out that they do nothing you feel bad again..   Work loads are horrible... They expect so much research from you but make you teach 4 courses per semester. That would be fine if the courses they assigned you was the same each semester but no.. A new set of courses every semester.   They so desperately want to be like a western university but the they lack the fundamentals of proper respect for humans. HR seems like a black box requests emails information goes in but you never know what comes out. So many faculty members that have complained to the HR about their poor work some how do not get their contracts renewed..   The Ipad dilemma  is discussed in others reviews adequately.   I was part of a large group of faculty members that left this past summer we were fed up with the problems at the university. I went back to get summer pay but others went without. I am now without a job state side but happy to be here.",0.9961882,0.003501865,0.0003099705
Zayed University is a great place to work. I only teach women (love the gender segregated classes!) and I find them to be highly motivated curious and bright. Since few of the women will ever need to work for financial reasons they pursue education out of a desire to give back to their country and to be role models for their children. The faculty and staff are very collegial and supportivefrom the provosts to the administrative support staff. The salaries are higher than almost any other country in the world (Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the only ones that pay better and have better benefits like transportation allowances) the free accommodations are excellent (huge villas for families and spacious 2 bedroom flats for singles) and travel for conferences is generous (full airfare hotel and other travel expenses). It is easy to get internal research grants up to $30000 (USD) and external grants from the government up to $1 million (USD). Unlike some universities in the Arab Gulf Zayed University strives to retain good faculty; promotion policies are clear and realistic. The facilities are great too. UAE nationals receive free tuition for all levels of college education and if they flunk out they lose this benefit. Flunking out of college brings shame not only on the student but on the family as well so students are highly motivated to succeed.,0.0024684647,0.0017615457,0.9957699
if you are not from the region you must come with cultural humility. This is not the west and one must be willing to recognise that just because things may work differently here than the west doesn't mean they are wrong or that your culture is better. The biggest negative is that ZU seems to be consistently understaffed and this often means higher teaching loads (typical is 21 credits per year). But with higher teaching loads research expectations are low (one journal article a year). One must be comfortable with family being the priority ambiguity and a slower pace of life (the women even walk slower than in the west). Patience flexibility and an open mind are the keys to success here.,0.98823327,0.011544833,0.00022198845

"HR becomes nonresponsive after the initial welcome visit. Changing housing getting assistance with critical paperwork etc become difficult to impossible. Some faculty have threatened to quit or stop working until an issue is resolved.   Non or late payment of salary and bonuses. Not unique to the University but payment ontime is difficult to achieve in the gulf. Some faculty have waited 3 months for salaries to be paid. Bonus money is routinely delayed by weeks or months for unknown reasons. Reimbursement for research is routinely delayed by months and never paid promptly.   No culture of academics. The students and local faculty all seem to view the university as simply a rubber stamp to get them a higher salary in the job market. Many students are forced to attend school by future government employers who require a university degree so the level of motivation among students is nonexistent to low. The faculty are treated as babysitters and more like assembly line workers than actual faculty.   Cannot criticize the country or management. Discussion of religious topics is so taboo as to be almost forbidden. No lesson can openly be critical of the government or it's leadership. If students are critical of their leaders in a class instructors have to be extremely careful to steer the conversation to other topics. In faculty meetings even constructive review of the university management is not encouraged or allowed. Faculty can be fired or not have contracts renewed for being vocal about changes they would like to see. This leads to a culture of professors simply keeping their heads down and refusing to address any issues the university faces. This has been exacerbated by the new President. Firings ""sudden resignations"" and the instatement of Egyptians with no academic credentials has created a culture of fear and distrust at the University.   Limited to no research support. The university refuses to purchase access to critical research databases despite ongoing promises. Human subject approval can take weeks.   Poor student performance and attitude. Most of the students attending Zayed University are not ready or able to attend college. Full stop. Cheating plagiarism and paying others to complete classwork are common.

Pros:     Most colleagues are hard working professional and exceedingly helpful. While students often have low motivation they are vocal engaging and eager to share aspects of their culture with teachers.

Although new changes are afoot the staggering mismanagement by University College continues to be a blight on the university’s good name.  After working here over six years it is clear the deception and unprofessionalism perpetuated by the UC management—which has seemingly gone unnoticed for so many years—has increased in intensity since the move to the new campus in 2011.  In meetings if faculty members raise any pedagogical concerns or question course materials and outcomes—as is customary and encouraged in most professional academic environments—they are routinely threatened with dismissal.  The teacher’s role in University College is to remain voiceless and impotent as it is common knowledge that alerting higher management to University College's misconduct will only lead to threats of slander and/or outright firing.  Therefore the manner in which faculty is addressed in UC meetings continues to be one of outright contempt.   With no explanation or rationale instructors in University College have also been saddled with a grueling five classes which is in clear violation of the Middle States accreditation the university received only last year. It is not unusual to put in 60 hours (or more) of work per week to keep up with the marking.  Many of the IDS classes now exceed 30 students. On top of the five classes teachers are routinely harangued into joining committees geared towards initiatives in which they have little or no say in the first place.     Faculty members holding doctorates are expected to teach a course load of four classes and produce a steady stream of publications.  This stronger emphasis on research and publications—they are hiring only those with doctorates presently—is flagrantly deceptive. The new Ph.D. hires joining the UC in fall of 2014 will be saddled with four very large classes along with the unrelenting pressure to publish administrate and/or contribute to an endless list of committees.,0.998722,0.0011047351,0.0001732455

Students are admitted onto degree programs with an overall IELTS band of 5.0. Typically they score higher in the speaking and listening sections and lower in the reading and writing sections. In the latter two scores are usually in the range 3.5  4.5. Think about this for a minute. Consider what a student reading and writing at this level can and cannot do. Imagine four or five sections of thirty unable to comprehend a middle school textbook. Imagine trying to read 120 pieces of work at a time written by students most of whom cannot even comprehend their own writing (plagiarised) or communicate basic meaning. Imagine the content of the writing produced by students many of whom have never read a book. Think about what teaching at this level involves. Think back to junior high or even earlier. Imagine too the levels of motivation of students for whom the bar for university admission (and for that matter graduation) is so low. Consider large classes of students without a minimum threshold of content knowledge study skills or linguistic ability to access what you can offer. This is not even grade school. You need strong classroom management  skills to get by here. Is this really for you?  Now consider stakeholders and the University College management who never set foot in classrooms or hold teaching qualifications. They want a research university to rank alongside the best in the world. How would this affect you if you took up a position here stuck in the middle between the reality of where the students are and the delusions of your managers? How much research would you get done when your time is taken up managing such large lowlevel classes in addition to committee work the implementation of iPad initiatives trying to interpret unwritten syllabuses (drip fed to you week by week as they are conjured up) guessing what the assessments will be (because they haven't been written) etc etc? Imagine the plagiarism perfectly rational behavior from the perspective of a student practically illiterate in his/her medium of study faced with an unrealistic and inappropriate curriculum dictated by people who are not teachers. Then there is the admin work and the other trappings of rigor such as performance evaluations the results of which are often ignored. This is life for faculty in University College. There is no transparency. Your renewal or promotion is totally arbitrary depending on who you know and who your friends are. Members of faculty are abandoned by an irresponsible management obsessed with status and hierarchy and afraid and unwilling to dirty their hands with the reality of the teaching and learning environment. Nobody is happy. And if you dare make a suggestion or give feedback no matter how tactfully you try you are blacklisted. You are not here to apply the expertise you demonstrate on your resume. You are here to do what you are told however objectionable by people who are often appointed to their positions without qualifications in the field they oversee. The students can be helped of course. But don't expect management to support you in this. It is too busy dictating to you according to its own priorities. I have never worked in a place that fails so utterly to meet the needs of its students.  Please think very carefully before accepting a position here. Are things really that bad where you are that you feel the need to come here for this? Do not be fooled by the PR. Once you arrive you will have accrued liabilities  car furniture downpayments on children's school places. You will not simply be able to turn around and leave when the terrible reality dawns on you. Most colleagues here feel disempowered demoralised disengaged and dejected. They want to go but cannot (yet) and envy those who can. I for one deeply regret my decision to come here.,0.99866676,0.0011774685,0.00015574314

I used to love working at ZU but things went downhill quickly with a change in leadership occurred. The administration is totally detached from faculty and what's happening on a daily basis in the class rooms and the colleges. Teaching load kept increasing as well as research expectations and admin obligations leaving no room for serious scholarship (maybe a way to keep people there since it becomes more and more difficult to get employed somewhere else after working here). The administration has created an environment of fear threat and anxiety which leads to a quick turnover in faculty but no one seems to notice or care. People with zero admin experience are placed in positions (e.g. Associate Dean and Dean) where they are literally ruining entire colleges making people resign coz they cannot take the extremely unprofessional unprecedented and unacceptable behavior anymore.  The management doesn't do anything to support faculty so it feels more like a trench war between faculty and management. It cannot be that management actually lies to its faculty (even the occasional pay rise does not make this morally right). Faculty should be treated like serious scholars and be trusted as any adult should be trusted.  At times it felt as if we were controlled/punished like students. The idea of punishment is what management appears to be advocating which is ludicrous in a university; a university that could be really great!,0.9980667,0.0016754408,0.00025776896

"Current atmosphere is generally one of indifference and fear as leadership decisions rarely make sense and staff live under constant threat of having their  position ""nationalized""",0.99900585,0.00084553094,0.00014859783
I left this organization in 2011 after working 8 years in one of the Colleges. There were many good things at ZU when I joined (2001) such as competent and fair Deans sufficient budget and visionary leadership. The faculty staff and students were engaged. The salary and benefits were adequate. The collective culture felt that we were part of something very important. The best part of the job (despite the culture of decay) was teaching engaged students; these are some of the nicest students you will find.,0.00043613964,0.0011441464,0.99841976
"Early in the University's timeline the budget was frozen resulting in a slow decline in quality scope and morale. The better faculty and leadership left. In their place stepped in less than professional Administrators Deans and Assistant Deans. There was pressure from a Dean to put his name on professors"" publications with the understanding that it could be tied to renewal. Renewal was not always based on performance. An atmosphere of fear and bullying developed in some faculties. Ethical and promising professors then left. (Indeed during the last recession 4 faculty out of a total faculty of 23 resigned without having other positions to move to.) Accreditation projects were assigned where compliance was manufactured and accreditation awarded to the institute and colleges. Accreditors were not given access to all faculty; indeed some faculty were warned not to talk to accreditors.  Leadership in some colleges is selfserving (the opposite of the Servicing Leader). Lack of budget and research opportunities were perenial problems. Increasing class load and the pressure to teach over the summer compounded the problems. The benefits and salaries did not keep up with inflation. Poor leadership in the colleges and neopotism within executive leadership also occurred. Deans were not regularly evaluated by their faculty (e.g. a new dean who was threatening and unscrupulous was not evaluated for at least 2.5 years).  The promotion process is flawed; some Deans appeal to the Provost to overturn the results of the Promotion Committee. The Promotion Committee reviews the faculty's promotion submission. The faculty portfolio is reviewed by external reviewers. Yet this can be rejected at the discretion of the Dean and Provost. This corruption kills engagement.",0.99878424,0.0010799344,0.00013581054
