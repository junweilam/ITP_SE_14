"Part time staff never gets paid on time. Payroll frequently makes errors with taxes unbeknownst to staff members who often have to pay fines for miscalculated tax amounts. Other departments can be incompetent and you will be forced to do their job for them just so you can get what you need done.  It is not uncommon for documents to go missing or for memos to go unsigned for months on end only to be told that there was an ""error"" or that a deadline has passed and that it is no longer valid.  Staff members are not a priority at this company.  They will reduce the number of available parking spaces and then issue warnings if you are forced to park outside of the parking lines (even if you are not obstructing anyone.)  At one campus lecturer's cars are being towed during classes because of the severe parking situation Directors will lose their cool and act irrationally then refuse to apologize for when they insult staff members (Finance and Security & safety in particular). There is no toner in the printers (good luck trying to print exams) and they are not efficient at paying bills so companies withhold services (such as not providing toner soap paper until bills are paid).  Staff is still expected to do their jobs despite having limited resources and are often held accountable by both upper management and students while being ignored when questions are asked.  These problems are also not new they have been ongoing from since before the economy started to sink.  Students are frequently rude to staff members and faculty when reports are made the student is praised for their ""unique way of dealing with difficult situations"" and the staff member is given a talk about why they were wrong to have aggravated the student (even if the reason that the student became aggravated was that they were absent for an exam despite not being in class for weeks and not responding to emails.)  The president micromanages every memo and purchase hence the backlog of unsigned memos.  Little to no thought is given to many decisions made and when the system fails staff is left with the task of cleaning up the mess.  Upper management have been known to be rude to staff members when suggestions or questions are asked one staff member was told that they can feel free to find another job rather than address the problem that was brought to their attention.",0.9990088,0.00083594775,0.00015524845
