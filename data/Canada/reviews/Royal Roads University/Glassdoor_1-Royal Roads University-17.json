As someone who has worked in PSE for many years and several institutions across the Province and has comparative experience, RRU is simply the worst PSE I have ever encountered. Embarrassed to also be an RRU alumni now that I have worked there, this University does not practice any of what they teach, very hypocritical that way. Very resistant to progress and change unfortunately, so I did not see a future for myself at RRU as there was no acknowledgement of anything even being wrong therefore no effort to change for the better - very short sighted and sad really - there could be such potential there. As employee you will not be or feel valued, you will experience work place frustration, you will not be engaged, and you may even been bullied and harassed and nothing will be done about it. I would suggest not wasting time working at RRU, I wish I hadn't, it was a waste of 5 years of my career and left me with the worst feelings of professional dissatisfaction. No workplace is perfect but the issues at RRU are so widespread and ignored, there doesn't seem to be even hope for positive change there. I felt a sense of huge disappointment to have spent 5 years working at RRU. I have not one good thing to say about my time there."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Ok place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Gardener in Colwood, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Beautiful and Famous place to work", "cons": "Understaffed for all the work needed"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great organization but lots of systems issue", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Enrollment Advisor in Victoria, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good compensation and mostly good culture (dependent on team)", "cons": "Some very poor management in certain areas and silos"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Ab", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Messenger in Victoria, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work at there", "cons": "I love royal toads universiaity"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Amazing colleagues!
