Also, they just cut the hours of ONLY part-timers who already barely have any hours to begin with. Cutting hours is definitely better than being laid off but the cut backs should have been made for everyone not just those who are part-time. All Team Leader opportunities are full time and only during day shifts so if you're a night shift employee, forget about moving up in the company. The company is also very cheap when it comes to employee retention and satisfaction... While I appreciate any kind of reward or gift, they literally gave out $10 gift cards as a Christmas bonus... Laughable and embarrassing, especially when they take a few dollars from every single one of our pay cheques every two weeks which amount to way more than $10 and there are rarely any other events such as team building events or anything of the sort. They also came out with a new reward system that is a complete joke and feels more like an upline of a pyramid scheme than an actual reward program (to get the most out of it, you need to share job postings with people and have people you know join the company.

You will be promised a full time job when you first join but sadly, they over employ so many people that it becomes hard to get a full time shift. And when they do get you to full time, they will try to find a way to push you out by giving you abnormal hours to work which doesn't go into overtime because of how they have their work week listed. They are also highly stingy about the heat and rarely listen to people before a catastrophe is about to break out. I used to freeze to death at early morning shifts there and management was least bothered about it inspite of my repeatedly complaining about it. I couldn't even put on a personal heater because they baby proofed the power bar because they feared there would be a power outage if people did hook on. Yet when it came to their newest of technology, they would miraculously have power bars that were sufficient to accommodate those. Once the building furnace broke down in the December winter and we had to work through that cold for 5 days because of some odd part which they weren't able to get brought into the office. This made me wonder why in the era of fedex, they couldn't get the part brought in sooner instead of waiting for a human being to personally bring it in. And no exaggeration, many of us were working with blankets on us and we went through a month's supply of hot chocolate in less than 5 days when this happened because people were so ridiculously cold. And we couldn't even ask for more hot chocolate because the quota for the month was gone. And even if they are not willing to commit to it being their fault for not listening, human lives should have mattered. They are also highly deficient in communicating sudden changes in the office. Like you could get locked out of your computer because of some software adaptation that they neglect to tell you about and then you are out for 2 hours to get yourself back in. They also are not good at fostering an environment of cooperation. I felt like I was being pitted with my peers for no reason by management because of how they didn't run the organization properly.

As a nurse, I want to enrich lives and empower the patients I cross paths with. However, it's hard to be a good nurse when you don't feel supported and are made to feel mediocre by upper management. \n\nTraining and orientation is unorganized and not motivating, especially for new nurses. Although Saint Elizabeth provides a clinical practice resource team hotline 24/7, it is simply not enough when more clinical support is needed. Often times I have found myself scheduled to see a complex client that needs a specific nursing task done that I have not been trained for but was scheduled to see that client anyway. \n\nI found that when I had questions that needed answering, the upper management often pass the buck to another employee. Individual workers are expected to seek out their own training. \n\nFor example; if you wanted to get extra help learning how to work around a port a cath, you are expected to find a co worker to do a joint visit so you can (hopefully) learn in one visit. However, there are instances when the coordinators will schedule you to a client that you are not trained to care for, which is dangerous for both you and the client. Better training and clinical support is needed.

There is no gym or any immediately-walkable locations to visit for take-out food/drink.", "cons": "Lack of Accountability from Management: \r\nManagers will constantly deflect blame and are quick to point fingers instead of owning mistakes and working to correct them. Eventually, those mistakes fall into the ether while managers argue over who is to blame. The lack of accountability stretches far beyond management and impacts every aspect of the services provided and the company as a whole. Nearly every person that works at Saint Elizabeth is looking out for themselves.\r\n\r\nLack of Reviews and Direction: \r\nManagement does not properly conduct formal employee performance reviews. You will never know how your performance is being perceived and how to improve yourself. Directors and Management offer vague directives and hold unrealistic expectations. You may attempt to clarify the instructions, but will be met with frustration. Many employees feel unprepared and feel that they lack the necessary support to succeed.\r\n\r\nPoor Culture: \r\nThe people that work at Saint Elizabeth are very passive-aggressive. The culture itself is also highly toxic. Of course, there are many nice people to work with, but across the board, many people feel drained and discouraged by the company and its mismanagement.\r\n\r\nLack of Growth and Opportunities:\r\nWhile Saint Elizabeth touts itself as a steadily-growing company, there are very few opportunities for upward mobility. Many managers also prefer to hire externally rather than promoting from within their own teams. Bottom line: If you perform well, you will be kept in your role (and strung along with passing compliments or promises of opportunities) with little chance for a raise or promotion. There is a high employee turnover here.\r\n\r\nLack of Diversity:\r\nThere is a great lack of diversity within the company, especially amongst management and executives. Healthcare is a highly-diverse field, especially in Canada. How is it that a healthcare company features and hires so few visible minorities?\r\n\r\nMiddling Benefits and Compensation:\r\nThe benefits package offered is middling, at best. Good luck claiming expenses as well - management will put up a fight prior to allowing an expense for an off-site drive or meeting. Need to take the 407 to get to Hamilton when a last-minute meeting comes up? Need to pay for parking at a downtown B2B meeting?
