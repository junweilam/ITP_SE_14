I learned a lot.\r\n\r\nThe training is quite good and the organization prepares you quite well for the job.", "cons": "Some locations have poor teamwork, bad attitudes, laziness and toxicity.\r\n\r\nPoor management in general. Most of the managers I met were largely incompetent (at least from a team management perspective). CH usually hires managers from within - so the mentality is that if you are a good frontline support worker and are good at providing care for individuals, you must be good at managing a house and a team of multiple people! Which is almost always not true. Management was ineffective, communication was poor, problem solving was poor, involvement was poor. The teams that thrived did so in SPITE of the managers. The teams that struggled, continued to struggle BECAUSE of the managers. One manager I had would show up maybe once a week or two, generally in a bad mood, and generally try to micro manage little things that didn\u2019t matter. Everyone would walk on eggshells until they left, and we\u2019d see them again in a couple weeks! (They managed two locations - were they at the other location 95% of the time? Who knows.)\r\n\r\nInstead of firing incompetent, poor performing staff, management would always shuffle these staff to a new location. This was such a problem and ongoing issue that it was a running joke to be \u201cCH fired.\u201d Short of abusing individuals, you could do anything there and have a long 40 year career and not see consequences. (See above for ineffective management comments). This was likely due to the fact that CH was always short staffed and struggled to hire and retain staff. \r\n\r\nThe pay was slightly above minimum wage, but not industry competitive at all.\r\n\r\nThe job is a dead end job. While they do promote from within, 1-3 management positions might open per year, and dozens of eager front line workers would apply. Because it is a dead end job, lots of people hated it and worked there way too long (and created terrible team environments) simply because they figured they couldn\u2019t do better elsewhere. A lot of the team issues came from staff who had worked there 10+ years who just didn\u2019t care anymore and should have been fired/quit.\r\n\r\nThe hiring process is brutal. Multiple rounds of way too long interviews and paperwork needing to be submitted means that it\u2019ll take 1-2 months for them to hire you after you apply. Chances are you\u2019ll have received 7 other job offers before CH even calls you to do the 3rd interview!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Poor management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Developmental Support Worker in Kingston, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Over all wonderful supportive coworkers and delightful clients.", "cons": "Management copes poorly with staffing situations and shortages resulting in good employees taking on the excess burden and getting burnt out."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great organization", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 Oct 2022", "job_title": "IT Manager in Kitchener, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "amazing employees\r\ngood management\r\ngreat environment to work in", "cons": "pay is poor\r\nbenefits could also be better"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Average", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "25 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional (DSP) in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with the people supported", "cons": "Long hours, uncertain ending times"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Balance work life", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Direct Support Professional (DSP) in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free food and good friends", "cons": "Shift change\r\nUnstable shift\r\n24hrs\r\nLate night shift\r\nLess staff on shift"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Administrative", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Administrative in Waterloo, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some good co-workers.
