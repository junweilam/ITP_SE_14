They make it a pretty good workplace to be in. The job itself is fun if you work with the right team that year, and you get lots of opportunities to network in the community. The pay is above market price and they hire young entry-level people, which is rare these days. It is definitely a good stepping stone job because you get lots of experience that will look good on your resume. **I did not work in 2011, I just cannot disclose when I worked there as it will be easier to identify me.", "cons": "No benefits, medical or otherwise. Lots of driving, which can be annoying. Very repetitive work. No room for advancement as it is such a small organization. They do not pay overtime even though you work a lot of overtime, instead they have adopted a lieu hours system on a 1 hour worked 1 hour off basis instead of 1 hour worked 1.5 hour off like it should be - which is the worst part. The contract is for less than a year, so you have to get another job fast."}]]
