If you ask too many questions or the same question too many times, because you haven't done it a long time, they look at you very judgingly. All I can say is make sure you are always making good notes that can refer to all the times. When you have your weekly review don't be afraid to ask ... 'what can I do better next time?' Because they never indicate that there is ever an issue or a problem...not even when you are walking out the door. If you do something incorrectly they won't tell you how they wish things to be done. They just expect you to know. They don't communicate effectively and the old guard stick together, so it is very hard to be included in their culture. They start off very nice and helpful, but that changes over a short time and you don't know why.
