Everybody is trying to help everybody. it is really heartwarming.\r\n- 3 Second Cups in the hospital. 3!!\r\n- Easy to move from department to department. The culture is different on every unit, so if you don't like one, there's always other options\r\n- No strict hierarchy as in many other hospitals. Everybody is a valued professional.\r\n- Can get by even if your French isn't great as long as you're putting an effort into learning.", "cons": "BUDGET CUTS ARE A KILLER\r\n- Expect working hard and often skipping your breaks or leaving late.\r\n- Hospital is increasingly busy but no new funds or resources are allocated for staff to help deal with the changes. As a result, nurses, lab techs, doctors, and pharmacists are working extra hard to maintain the quality of care and patient satisfaction at the cost of their own sanity. We're all en route to burnout.\r\n- Closed budget friendly cafeteria that was popular among employees in favour of overpriced private restaurants. No more affordable healthy meal options available.\r\n- Seniority rules all. Can't get a leave of absence without 5 years of seniority. Vacation and work schedule are scheduled by seniority. For a full-time position, one must usually work at least 5 years, on some units or clinics, 10 years.\r\n- extra conservative staffing on weekends - because patients are less sick on weekends?!?\r\n- The hospital invests in the infection prevention and control department more and more and yet bed coordinators and managers do not follow any infection control rules and protocols. Their priority is to unload the ER department and they will book any bed for any patient. They will say \"a bed is a bed\". And that is how outbreaks begin.\r\n- Patients often come with high expectations of care and are frequently disappointed at how little attention they're paid or how slow their treatments progress. With good reason. But the ones who get most of that rage are nurses despite working so very hard."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great  place for a new RN grad", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its a teaching hospital with a diverse population, there is a lot of unique learning opportunities for nurses.
