The \"leadership\" team is made up of individuals who have no business acumen and make decisions based on their moods, which are frequently erratic. \r\n\r\nEverything, every day is like the sky is falling. The organization is run by fear and decisions made at the drop of a hat, whichever way the wind blows, and without regard for people, funds, or any industry best practices. \r\n\r\nIt's been said there is a \"tradition\" of firing people who show any signs of knowledge, experience, or any drive to succeed. \"Leadership\" sees any up-and-comers as a threat to their 30 yr, 20 year, and 12 year roles within the org.\r\n\r\nRun! Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Do not waste your time working for executives that will no sooner feel threatened by anyone smart, capable, and reasonable and let you go without a second thought. \r\n\r\nSo so so many people have quit this organization. Turnover is beyond compare."}], []]
