They were the reason I came to work everyday.  \r\n\r\nYou get your birthday off and the office closes during the holiday period for a week.  \r\n\r\nThey are trying to create a more positive employee experience with social events.\r\n\r\nThe work can be really great depending on your position.  \r\n\r\nThere are travel opportunities (though a lot of unpaid overtime work is involved in these).", "cons": "The salary is low, even for a charity. It is actually below what is considered the cost of living for Toronto (which is ironic considering the goals of the charity). Most staff struggle to make ends meet. On top of that, staff are expected to work a great deal of unpaid overtime - late into evenings and especially on weekends. This overtime is disguised as part of the \"culture\" so that staff feel bullied into working it. If they do not work the unpaid overtime it is reflected in their annual reviews.  \r\n\r\nWhile most staff can barely afford necessities, the majority of Directors live in free staff housing. (The organization says it is discounted accommodated and not free, however the rent equals in a year what most people pay in a month in Toronto - so for the sake of this review, we'll call that free). The staff housing was originally intended to make up for how low the salaries were. This is no longer the case, and most of the staff housing is used by Directors. These Directors have worked at the organization for a number of years and though they have been promoted beyond the super low salaries, they have continued to live in the staff housing. This means that those making the most at the organization are those taking advantage of the low rent, while those making the lower salaries must find a way to meet the crazy Toronto rental prices. There are a couple houses available for coordinators however they are not the private apartments that Directors live in - instead they student housing where you have to share rooms with your own colleagues.   \r\n\r\nThe vacation allowance is pitiful. On top of how demanding they are with weekends and evenings, they offer the minimum vacation required in Canada and no more. Half of the year is a blackout period too.  Yes, the office closes for a week during the holidays but this hardly makes up for the hours employees work in overtime. There is no time in lieu either for weekend work.  \r\n\r\nThe senior management has largely been promoted due to length of service rather than actual experience. As a result they have responsibilities that they cannot handle, and their skills have never been \"checked\" meaning they often do not have appropriate people managing / project management experience. Because they have been at the organization for so long however, staff are expected to just go with what they think is right and are not supposed to question decisions. It can be very frustrating for those who have had jobs and careers outside of the organization when the people you are working for have never.  \r\nThe biggest issue with this organization is what they consider their \"culture\". I was recently told by someone who had no idea what my employment history was that \"if organizations truly live and breathe their culture, they don't need to hang their values on the wall of every room\". This is the greatest way to sum up working for Free The Children. They hang their values on every room in every building, but hardly live them. They also disguise bullying, overtime, etc as \"culture\".  If you don't \"volunteer\" your personal time, you are not a \"cultural fit\".  Humility, gratitude and appreciation?  Let's start with the co-founder who everyone fears and avoids at all costs.  \r\n\r\nA number of other reviews mentioned the forced trips on school buses to the \"staff retreat\". Yes, this does feel like a cult. Staff are forced to learn word for word the \"key messaging\" of the organization and then repeat these mantras in front of the co-founder who will go after you if you get a word wrong. You are sent up on the weekend and forced to stay overnight...with no overtime or time in lieu. You're usually lucky if the showers and toilets are working (that is not a joke).  \r\n\r\nStaff are undervalued and continuously treated in a disposable way. Without disclosing too much, the employment awards are a joke and not a reflection of what development, training, etc opportunities are available.\r\n\r\nI loved this organization when I joined it. I was hopeful and enthusiastic. My feelings only took about a month to change though and by the time I left not a single co-worker asked me why - instead they all told me they were jealous that I was getting out. What outsiders see is a facade. What is truly behind the walls is a negative environment where staff are given no reason to stay. The organization is unwilling to grow and understand that it is no longer the small grassroots charity it previously was.  It is filled with talented people who believe in the cause but have had other careers and thus have realistic expectations on what an employee should offer. With a few changes people would be willing to stay but instead those that speak out are considered negative."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great on resume!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "9 May 2015", "job_title": "Manager in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I spent 4 years with them and when I moved to my new role, people were shocked at what I was able to contribute to my new team.

Many employees don't last a year in their position, and to fill in gaps they overload the people who are still there until they're burnt out and also leave. \r\n\r\nWhenever someone questions why something is done, they are told by management that they are \"not a team player\", or are \"\"being negative\".

As a result, it attracts the upper crust of amazing\r\nindividuals who are filled with energy and passion and love.  I have undergone,\r\nand watched many others undergo a transformation from excitement, endless\r\nenergy and passion to disillusionment, sadness and angry bitterness after they\r\nsee, and experience FTC taking advantage of, and exploiting that passion to a\r\ndegree that is just sickening.  And truly heartbreaking.\r\n\u2022 Retention\r\nRetention is not a thing at FTC.  They view everyone as easily replaceable.  Their employees are not treated as assets and they are certainly not viewed as assets. They are viewed as a means to an end, or, a cog in a machine and they will watch, shrugging their shoulders as amazing individual after amazing individual smartens up and walks away. And then they will hire and train a new individual who is hopefully also amazing and the cycle will repeat. It is\r\nnot a good feeling to be a cog and it adds more to everyone\u2019s plate to have to\r\nconstantly train new people and do their own jobs without the knowledgeable,\r\ncapable person that they watched walk away. It is staggering that no one has\r\nrealized how unsustainable this is. Or, more realistically, it is staggering\r\nthat people have recognized how unsustainable this is and have continued to let\r\nit happen.\r\n\u2022 Promotions\r\nBecause FTC is such a challenging place to work there is a ridiculous turnover rate.  The amount of people I saw come and go is actually laughable and should be enough to get the\r\nattention of the leaders of this organization and instigate some sort of\r\nchange. With that being said, the people that do stay, get promoted.  That is the sole qualification FTC needs to see. It is important to say that there are a lot of incredibly talented, smart, creative people in positions of leadership at FTC but for the most part, the\r\npeople who are promoted into upper management roles are promoted because they have put their time in.  Not because they have any of the qualifications needed.  Not because they are even close to capable of the roles they are put into.  Certainly not because they have the ability to manage human beings.  But because they know what they are getting into and\r\ncontinue to want to move up and this misguided sense of \u2018loyalty\u2019 is valued\r\nbeyond all else there.  I have seen gross displays of incompetence, rudeness,\r\nand unprofessionalism that go unaddressed and are seemingly, rewarded, because\r\nI\u2019ve also seen the same people be promoted over others who are more competent, but haven\u2019t been there long enough, or spent too much time in a coordinator role and consequently are not regarded with enough respect to move up.\r\nI have also seen people that are smart, passionate and capable be\r\npigeonholed into jobs that they have hated.  Instead of recognizing the talent\r\nthey are so lucky to have, and cultivating these people into the roles they\r\nbelong in and will excel in, they trap them there under the pretense of needing\r\nto \u201cget the job done (period)\u201d.  There limited examples of people\r\nwho have been lucky enough, to have had the right director at the right time to\r\nbe recognized and developed and promoted into their dream roles and the\r\ncontributions they are making to the organization are nothing short of\r\nmiraculous.  But this isn\u2019t the norm.  It is 100% the exception to the rule and\r\njust makes the rest of us question why we weren't been discovered for the\r\nuntapped potential we feel we have to offer as well.  I should mention that\r\nthis isn\u2019t necessarily anybodies \u2018fault\u2019 because almost every single person in\r\nthis organization is too bogged down with too much work to have time to even\r\nthink about recognizing talent and cultivating potential.  People are simply\r\ntrying to get through each task and directors need each cog to function in the\r\nway they\u2019re supposed to in order for that to happen.\r\n\u2022 Pay\r\nThere\u2019s no need to say much about the pay.  It\u2019s horrible.  People are\r\nfinancially sinking in order to continue doing their work there.  I accumulated\r\nmore debt in interest on my student load than I was able to pay off.  So I ended\r\nup in a worse financial situation leaving FTC than I was in starting out. Directors expect people to drop their entire\r\nlives for this job and do not think for one second that they aren\u2019t properly\r\nrecompensing them for that.  Another review mentioned that the hours and pay\r\nare similar to other charitable organizations.  I have worked in several.  That\r\nis a not true.\r\n\u2022 Overtime\r\nIt is not unusual for FTC teams to be required to work over weekends and holidays.  This overtime is not reflected with higher pay, or lieu time off.\r\n\u2022 PS.\r\nOne other review actually says the situation is not as bad at the negative reviews make it out\r\nto be.  None of these reviews will prepare you for how terrible it is to work at FTC.  It is much\r\nworse than could possibly be conveyed in any 3-4 paragraph review."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not Recommended", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 May 2015", "job_title": "Coordinator in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are a young person applying you will meet lots of other young people that you will have fun with.", "cons": "There really is an abundance of cons.

Then the directors claim that being overworked and underpaid is what non-profit work is all about. So which is it exactly? Are we being paid according to industry standard or are we being underpaid? I\u2019ll go with the latter. Since leaving FTC, I have moved on to another non-profit organization, where everyone works an 8 hour day (not necessarily 9-5) and if they do work above that they are fairly compensated, as per the law. Don\u2019t let FTC manipulate you \u2013 this is not what non-profit work is like.

People management skills need to be developed \u2013 the amount of snarky banter that goes around this organization really makes you feel like you are back in high-school."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Don't believe the hype - stay away", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Manager in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-great, talented colleagues (at coordinator and management levels)\r\n-birthday off", "cons": "I find it very telling that so many \"positive\" reviews blame high the high turnover rates and negative reviews on those who have had those experiences and are leaving the organization.  They are confirming what so many reviews are saying, this organization refuses to look inward and understand the huge issues that are causing people to leave (and with such negative feelings).  In what world does an organization blame those who are leaving rather than try to understand why people are leaving?  And a note on those positive reviews, it is well known in the organization that HR requested staff to leave positive reviews to balance the feedback out - again refusing to acknowledge the major failures of this organization when it comes to its staff.  \r\nI would also like to comment on the reviews that state those leaving refuse to work hard and don't have an understanding of the charity sector.  I had a successful career before and after FTC, including working for two other reputable charities.  Since leaving FTC I am in a role far more demanding and I work a lot harder than I ever had to at FTC, and am more than happy to do so because I am respected and treated well.  The idea that I and others left because we don't want to work hard is ridiculous.  I can also state that the pay, lieu time and overtime expectations at FTC are far below the industry standards so do not claim that this is standard for charities.  As a coordinator at another respected charity I made far more than I ever did as a manager at FTC.  This organization takes advantage of its employees to maintain a lower administrative rate.  If you don't want to pay overtime (for the forced overtime that you require of your staff), why do you also refuse to give lieu time?  Lieu time doesn't affect your admin rates and your staff will not be resentful for the manipulation and advantage that you take of them.  \r\nWhat all other negative reviews have said are true, this organization forces overtime on staff and if you do not do it you are told you are not a \"cultural fit\" and your job is threatened. They use their \"values and culture\" (I use both terms incredibly loosely) to manipulate and bully staff.  Those in leadership roles have no business having the responsibilities that they do and have no real-world experience to lean on.  They lack crucial skill-sets, including people management skills, and as a result treat their direct reports horribly.  Because of the high turnover rate, employees get promoted far too quickly into senior roles without experience or leadership skills, further alienating staff and contributing to the ever increasing turnover rate. When employees complain or highlight the bullying and treatment from leaders, rather than support they are told to stay quiet and deal with it.  \r\nFTC can blame going through \"change\" all that it wants (an excuse they've been using for years) but all organizations, big and small, go through change, including where I currently work.  It is not the people leaving that are change-adverse, it is those who have been at the organization for more than 2 years who are change-adverse.  They refuse to acknowledge that their practices need to change and any new employee that comes on board with new ideas or dares to point out old practices that no longer work are declared negative and any enthusiasm that they had is stomped out of them.  I have never met a more miserable group of employees in my entire career, all so desperate to escape.\r\nThis organization refuses to acknowledge some serious problems within its walls (metaphorical and literal - people should not have to work in windowless garages with no heating and mice) and until they do I would not recommend that anyone work for FTC.  This place was by far the most negative employee experience that I ever had.  And again, this was not my first \"real\" job and it was not my last - so to those blaming these reviews on people who are work-adverse or don't know what a \"real job\" is - stop blaming those trying to address real issues and start looking inward."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Don", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2015", "job_title": "Communications Manager in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No pros.

As such, any correspondence coordinator position on the exec team is actually an administrative assistant position. Even the manager position on the exec team is an admin position - executive assistant position at most. I truly believe that if the job descriptions were adjusted FTC would have more success at keeping their employees.\r\n\r\nI gained no valuable professional experience as I was always doing the same monotonous work. There was absolutely no room to grow and this is immediately apparent after only a couple of weeks. Not to mention, the directors and associate directors - who lack little working experience outside of FTC - have poor management skills and prefer to \"throw their coordinators under a bus\" before assuming any responsibilities. Yes, the average age at FTC is 24; and yes, it shows. \r\n\r\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, one of the biggest problems at Free The Children is how they forcibly impose their culture on their employees. New employees need to be indoctrinated where they spend a whole week \"learning\" about the values and culture of FTC. Not to mention you are expected to share personal details about your life with strangers you work with. What I found most interesting was how they expect their employees to sacrifice their life, schedules, and extra-curricular activities to their culture. So for example, if you want a balanced lifestyle and you don't want to live and breathe work, then FTC is not for you. FTC does not understand in any shape or form that their employees want to have lives outside of their work. It's quite sad actually how they will abuse and exploit their employees to no end, forcing them to work 60 hours a week without lieu time or overtime. Let's not forget that the annual salaries are sometimes lower than minimum wage; there is absolutely no compensation for dedicated, hard labour at Free The Children. I had one day that I was extremely ill and had to stay home and I was continuously harassed with phone calls and expected to work from home. I feel that FTC exploits their employees, forcing them to believe that they are working for a good cause, when in fact they are being overworked. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the cofounders have absolutely no interest in investing time in understanding why their executive team has a revolving door of people coming in and out of their office. They also have impossible expectations for their employees. I would like to note that this isn't entirely their fault, they are surrounded by \"yes\" people and have come to believe that anything can be done when they ask for it, even if it is unreasonable. I have seen the lack of professionalism that the cofounders have displayed on many occasions, such as sharing confidential information with colleagues without following professional procedures. They seem to not understand that a protocol for such conversations should be in place.\r\n\r\nEveryone who has left Free The Children is given the chance to share their advice with their director and HR in an exit interview; unfortunately,  little effort is made to take these conversations seriously. I urge the cofounders, directors, associate directors, and human resources to take exit interviews seriously. Just because something has always been done a certain way, doesn't mean they can't be changed for the better. This is interesting advice to give an organization that advocates for active social change...\r\n\r\nCareer Opportunities: even a month at FTC will help you put up with anything that is ever thrown your way.
