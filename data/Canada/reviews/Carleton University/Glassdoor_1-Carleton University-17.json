The university has several research centers and institutes, fostering an environment of innovation and discovery. Co-op and internship programs: Carleton has a robust co-op and internship program that allows students to gain valuable real-world experience while still pursuing their studies. These programs provide students with a competitive edge in the job market and help them develop practical skills.

While there are student clubs and organizations, the overall social scene on campus may not be as vibrant as in larger institutions. Location: Carleton's location in Ottawa, Ontario, can be seen as a drawback for some students. Although Ottawa offers cultural and political opportunities, it may lack the hustle and bustle of larger urban centers. Additionally, the weather can be challenging, especially during the winter months. Class sizes and overcrowding: Some undergraduate classes at Carleton University can be quite large, resulting in limited individual attention from professors. This can make it challenging for students to have meaningful interactions and personalized feedback in certain courses. Limited course availability: While Carleton offers a broad range of academic programs, there may be limitations in terms of course availability and scheduling.

Most departments have a clock in/clock out mentality and are scrutinized for everything. Can luck out and get a decent environment  but usually only in smaller departments. Because of all of this, low moral across the board with staff and high turnover. Union is horrible - keep people in positions who would be fired in any other circumstance. Most frustrating thing is nepotism - job descriptions ask for specific level of education OR equivalent. How do you categorize equivalent? Depends on who is on hiring committees. Super frustrating that you are helping students get bachelor or graduate degrees and the people dolling out the advice have never even been through the experience. If I was a struggling student and asked a staff what their education and they responded \"none\" or college certificate, I would question \"what's the point\" if I can end up with a decent paying job with pension and benefits?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Seems good, but I'm a grad student so this is based on that experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Graduate Research Assistant in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-My supervisor is good\r\n-health benefits\r\n-located in beautiful Ottawa", "cons": "-Lots of weird union vs management vibes"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Undergraduate Student in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I find the flexible hours nice", "cons": "I think that unstructured is hard"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Working as RA for Carleton", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Research Assistant in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great professors and academic environment!
