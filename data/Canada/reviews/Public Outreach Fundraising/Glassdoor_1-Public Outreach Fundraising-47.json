Sure, you're learning about NGOs and you're helping raise money for those NGOs to help important causes, but often times, you're doing it by emotionally manipulating and pressuring people into donating, which doesn't feel great, even if it is for a greater cause. Sometimes you'll get people on the phone who just got out of the hospital, just had kids, or had some other big, expensive event happen to them and you're supposed act like you totally understand their situation and empathize with them, but if they just stopped drinking a coffee every few days they could donate 20+ dollars a month to something that has little to nothing to do with them. It's all just means to an end to helping people, and it's up to you to justify whether you're okay with those means. \r\n\r\nGetting hired is easy, but it doesn't mean you have a job here. You need to go through training, and if they decide you're not doing great, they'll let you go right there. Then you're on a trial period getting paid 15/hr, but if you don't get your numbers up consistently after 1 or 2 weeks, they'll let you go. If you last there for 6 months or so, you'll get benefits, but you'd have to be pretty exceptional to last that long. Even if you make it past all this, they'll still let you go if you stop producing numbers, and sometimes it's just down to luck. You're calling random people all day and you don't know if they'll donate. Most don't. In the end, it's just a glorified sales job. If you're not good at sales, set your sights on something else. \r\n\r\nFinally, they continue to emphasize that it isn't cold-calling, but you're calling people from the numbers they gave when they signed a petition on the street. If you've ever signed a petition, did you think you were consenting to being called with fundraising requests for a few months straight? Probably not.

If you don't sign up 3 people in the first 3 days, you get fired. So most employees never see the advertised wage.\r\n\r\n2) It is misleadingly advertised as work in the non-profit sector. Rest assured, this is a FOR-profit organization whose goal is to take a cut from non-profit organizations. The starting position is sales-- high-pressure sales. If you don't meet their targets, you're gone.\r\n\r\n3) Continuing on from the previous point, I was encouraged to pressure low-income individuals into donating because they were more likely to give in than wealthy people. Absolutely immoral. I do not know if this occurs in other branches of PO, but I would not be surprised. \r\n\r\n5) Some managers are well-intentioned, but almost all lack the necessary experience and training required to manage effectively. There is zero protection for employees who experience verbal or sexual harrassment from prospective donors, fellow employees, and even management themselves! It is obvious that whoever is responsible for promoting and hiring has no idea what they are doing. Upper management obviously doesn't care either. Extremely toxic work environment.\r\n\r\n6) Building on the previous point, those that stay in the company have a cult-ish attitude. The training session was extremely culty. I question the judgement and morality of anyone who stays there longer than a few months (barring absolute necessity).\r\n\r\n7) The work itself can be physically demanding and at times unsafe. You are working outside in all weather conditions. The weather part is listed in the job description, but they leave out the part where you can face verbal and sometimes even physical assault at this job (especially if you're working on the streets).\r\n\r\nTo summarize, if you see this job advertised on any job board...
