An antiquated structure in which departments and individuals are pitted against one another, instead of working together toward a shared mission. Middle management are very good at managing up and hiding their poor behaviour from senior management. It's been going on this way so long it would seem that senior management prefers it this way. \r\nThere is of course a lot of bureaucracy - it's an old, mid-sized institution working with two unions. But it's a lie that this is the main reason why things are so inefficient. It is an ingrained and traditional hierarchy - the inefficiency comes from the top via poor communication, poor organization, bad practices and backwards ideas.\r\nNew employees are set up to fail - my \"onboarding\" basically amounted to \"hear is your windowless cube, here are the files, now get to work.\" I was lucky to be seated next to my very kind former co-worker, who I was forced to ask about 20 questions a day due to the fact that there were no guidelines or resources. It was also like walking back into the 1950s...weird, sad cubicles for lower lever staff and windowed offices for management. I was expected to be at my desk at 9am, regardless of my actual schedule. There was no consideration for wfh, then the pandemic came along and they were screwed...completely unprepared to work in the modern world. It took three months for for them to set me up with a laptop, which I needed since the VPN wasn't working on my personal laptop. Some people never got one! We had team meetings via conference call (I'm serious), until management learned how to navigate zoom. Sadly, it seems they have not learned from these many mistakes as they've announced a mandatory, full-time return to in-office. This is mind-boggling. Amidst a labour shortage they are making themselves an even less-desirable place to work.\r\nBullying was common and rewarded, an atmosphere of classism and racism simmered under the surface. \r\n\r\nOf course, this is the tip of the iceberg. Ultimately, I understand why people would be drawn to work here, but if you can get your experience somewhere else that actually values its workforce and has some consideration for positive workplace culture and work/life balance - please do."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Fine!", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice people!
