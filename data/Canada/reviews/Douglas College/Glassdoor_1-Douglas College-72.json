After many-many-many years of contributing 8.5% of your salary (mandatory), upon retirement you will be given a pension that is proportionate to your salary. I am not saying that municipal pension is bad but it is not a miracle. 3) The union is very passive in protecting members' interests. HR refuses to address concerns and sends staff back to the union. You end up in a cycle where you are not properly represented. 4) Although there are still some caring managers and some good leaders, the environment became worse in the past three years after some changes in senior management.
