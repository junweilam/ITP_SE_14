For an organization that prides itself on quality of health standards, it is the most toxic and unhealthy working establishment I have ever worked for. Ironic their mission is to better health quality standards but are the causes of so many employees feelings burnt out and unsupported. This organization is terrible with building trust and moral. So many people are currently on leave due to having no other ways to manage the day to day bullying and workload stress. High turn over rate. New contractors being hired routinely to make up for all of the employees who quit or go on leave due to the work load. The HR team is arguably the most toxic in its industry.
