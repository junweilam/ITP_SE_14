There is a significant lack of communication and professionalism from leadership and the work environment is toxic, marked by instances of discrimination, racism, sexism, favoritism, and bullying. The school recycles and promotes unqualified staff based on favoritism rather than qualifications, resulting in staff being placed in leadership roles without the necessary skills or experience to perform effectively. There have been countless instances of unprofessionalism within all departments of the school. The lack of union is unfortunate and the presence of a board of directors and governors are only there primarily to protect the administration this has resulted in a lack of workplace democracy. The management and HR is corrupt and the school's financial practices raise questions. The school is advertised as a non-profit charity, however, it is runned by a business for profit. Those in positions of power tend to abuse their authority. Many staff are scared to bring up issues because of all the corruption. There are serious unethical practices and the allegations raised are not being taken seriously this school needs to be investigated by an outside source properly. Overall, the school's unethical practices and toxic work environment outweigh the benefits of the good pay."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "14 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Instructor in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not stressful\nRoutine after a while", "cons": "Most students don't study and that might make you feel your job is not impactful."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great growth and experience for independent workers", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Dec 2014", "job_title": "Community Service Worker in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Phenomenal growth as a worker and a person in the helping field.
