Limited help or guidance, especially if this is your first time starting as a teacher. Though relaxing after a while, teaching can get quite boring and repetitive. Not to mention, it is poorly paid due to collective bargaining with the union. If you teach a well-paid industry (tech), don't expect your salary to be competitive. The salary ladder is the same for everyone and it takes at least 10-20 years of experience to max out at 98k CAD (full-time). The lowest rank starts at 46k and requires a Master's degree in the subject matter you teach. Getting full-time is extremely difficult. You will most likely be paid 1/4 of the full-time base pay for quite some years. Academic freedom is being jeopardized by the Quebec government. If the province finds your course dangerous to the French language, you will not be allowed to teach it and get laid off."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "ITSS Tech", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Computer/Network Technician in Saint-Laurent, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Unionized, protected job. 7 hour days, can start and finish early.
