In fact, the union advises staff against negotiating for better pay.\r\nThere are Festival office jobs that pay less than the front-line jobs - evidence that TIFF doesn't even have insight into their own business units, much less the competitive landscape.\r\nStaff would need to watch 1+ free movies daily to compensate for the wage deficit.
