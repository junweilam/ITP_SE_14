While employees languish in part time casual positions. \r\n\r\nUnion protects everyone including lazy employees. \r\n\r\nEX. Just last week I saw a co-worker sitting down and resting his head in is chest with his eyes closed IE. He was sleeping.   \r\n\r\nPart time employees are allowed to take hours from casuals. \r\n\r\nWhen jobs are posted anyone from CUPE can apply. IE. A woman in catering can apply for a  part time or full time job in a totally different department. If she has the most seniority out of all of the applicants, and gives the best interview she gets the job. \r\n\r\nSo someone who has been there for years, will always be passed over for a job. because instead of being fair, and keeping it seniority at the department level, it often goes to someone who has zero experience in the position, but will be trained. \r\n\r\nOftentimes people from other departments who successfully get hired in another department quit before starting, or they complete their training and then they change their mind and go back to their old job. \r\n\r\nThis costs TOH money to post the job, interview people, and go down the list when the successful candidate changes their mind. \r\n\r\nOftentimes when you contact the union nothing is done, as they are part of the problem. It is in the collective agreement that allows the above to occur, and they do not want to change anything. \r\n\r\nEmployees will have to work years and years to get anywhere as seniority and speaking French are they only way to get ahead at TOH. Unless you know someone.\r\n\r\nMany people feel hopeless about their future at TOH. I myself have applied for over 300 jobs, and nothing outside of 1 interview, and a few tests has happened. \r\n\r\nYou can suggest ideas to managers,  and they will listen; but 9/10 nothing happens. If they suggested an idea, it would be more than likely be implemented immediately or very soon after. \r\n\r\nMorale is down all over and I don't see TOH doing anything to really fix that. \r\n\r\nMahogany row, where upper management offices are, is nice and new... with new furniture etc. Rest of hospital is old needs work.
