Colleagues are more genuine and very friendly and accommodating when you are going through personal/professional difficulties. 95% of the organization works a standard workweek and benefits are great too. Employer-matched RRSP and full health and dental with 0% paid out of pocket. There are various committees to join such as Social, Health and Wellness. Teams do regular activities outside of work.
