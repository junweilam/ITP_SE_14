Things feel toxic and an end doesn't seem to be in sight. The culture at Jack.org currently feels like the worst it has ever been with awful morale and zero trust in leadership or HR. This can easily be construed as disgruntled, entitled staff causing a fuss because of change - but from conversations with many folks below the VP and CEO level, this sentiment is approaching unanimous among a staff of 80+. This is following sincere optimism around changes to strategy and leadership. The reason staff feel angry enough to say something is that they care so much and continue to feel disrespected, discounted, and devalued. The lack of accountability around deadlines, frameworks, justification is frustrating to see. It feels like an uphill battle to get any transparency around fallout from recent layoffs. Most people are seeking new work as it isn't worth the struggle to stay. There are good intentions around EDI (see Rowena Pinto's responses to the posts here) - but ask anyone how this looks in practice and it is terrible/more harm than good.

While the CEO seemingly upholds EDI ideology at town hall meetings, she turns around hiring her hand-picked favourite people without a transparent and equitable process. She belittles her staff. In 1:1 meetings, she loses her posture easily and sometimes emotionally mistreats staff. Many people are under immense mental distress (ironically this is a mental health charity).

However, as I came across the reviews posted by my current and former colleagues at Jack.org, I couldn't agree with more. I truly believe the truth of these reviews as I can testify to them based on my own work experience here. I truly believe these are comments made from the bottom of their hearts. The reviews are posted because we care. The truth has to come out because we are sad to see how a promising charity go down to be a demoralizing, oppressing, inequitable organization struggling more for its own survival (to pay for the CEO and the VPs' salaries) than for its missions - the mental health of young people. Since about 10 months ago, my mental health has started to deteriorate due to the toxic morale prevalent among the executive leadership first and later among my peers in all departments. In my own interactions with the CEO, Rowena Pinto (the company profile on Glass needs to be updated - NOT Eric Windeler anymore), I feel demoralized and psychologically unsafe. Her tone in those private conversations are not professional and could be emotionally intimidating (which I agree with a post below that mentioned about being mistreated). In our discussions, my disagreement on some issues was often taken as \"emotionally not happy about her\", so I just stopped disagreeing by shouting down my voice. During our annual budget proposals, the CEO ordered lunches, drinks and desserts for herself and the VPs on the donor's money, while we presenters had to stand there presenting during our lunch hours without food and watching them eat. I used to be loyal donor and fundraiser to Jack.org, the moment I saw them using our donors' money in this way, I turned around withdrawing my monthly commitment. Most employees are underpaid based on our workload and level of engagement (with lots of overtime unpaid), while the CEO and VPs are earning mid-$200K to high-$100K (data published on CRA's charity financial disclosure).

Best part of this workplace has always been peers/coworkers: honestly some of the best people I've ever worked with.

New executive leadership style is honestly disgusting. Decisions made behind closed doors. No transparency. Actively gaslighting staff. Avoiding answering questions or lying if they do answer questions. Treating staff as if we are disposable and interchangeable. Changing job titles and job descriptions without even speaking to managers. Saying we're not expected to do more with less, when they've just fired many staff without cause, which is very much impacting workload and literally makes us have to do more work with fewer people. Saying we're co-creating our programs with youth when we're not and often end up exploiting and burning out the youth advocates we work with. Saying we're working with 'priority populations' and equity deserving groups when EDI within the org is a joke and they don't make decisions or alter programming to actually bring about equity or justice.
