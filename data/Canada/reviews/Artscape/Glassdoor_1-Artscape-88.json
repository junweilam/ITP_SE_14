There are cases of inequality between employees of similar positions in regards to job expectations, responsibilities, pay and accountability. While staff are asked to voice their concerns and provide suggestions for improvement, it repeatedly feels like thoughtful and realistic solutions are ignored. Most office environments feel tense and unpleasant. Little value is placed on the retention and happiness of staff.

In turn, employees are overloaded and often experience repeat fires that they need to put out. There is a huge information sharing issue, which is tied to the dated technology and software\u2013as well as the lack of org wide communication, training and onboarding. The work culture can become quite toxic with the lack of strategy and vision. Due to the nature of receiving grants and having to meet stakeholder expectations, projects are hardly seen to completion. They are often started, then forgotten when something more pressing comes to the forefront. This creates a huge lack of accomplishment. The blurriness and unstable project goals create confusion around roles as well\u2013this makes it difficult to see career opportunities."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Claims to support artists but exploits them", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Dec 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "there are cool programs going on", "cons": "overtime work for no pay, demands that keep changing, top-down management that is incredibly white and old and stuck in their ways"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible work environment.
