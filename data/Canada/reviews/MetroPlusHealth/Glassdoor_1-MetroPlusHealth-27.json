Make sure you get FMLA right after your probation because the place is toxic and you need to keep your sanity.  Management is disengaged and punitive, unless they are engaging in discipline. The Male managers here run amok.  They say and do whatever.  Sometimes to your face.  Sometimes behind your back.  Sometimes in Spanish when they think you don't speak or understand it.  They are annoyed by any suggestions from staff and will do whatever they want whether it's the best path or not.  They will listen if the next level of management requires them to do so, but don't hold your breath. No concern for staff members and constant reversal of priorities all the while information may or may not trickle down.\nThey are allowed to bully and will, without any concern for your rights, because as a managerial employee you don't have any.  Say anything about the environment and they will remind you that you are free to go somewhere else."}], []]
