I was a bit apprehensive coming into this role as I have never worked in fundraising before or worked from home. The management are all incredible, extremely knowledgeable and really make you feel like your part of something greater than yourself. I have learned so much more than I thought possible and I was offered opportunities based on my skills which are constantly been worked on to get even better. Despite the team being home based I feel like I know all of them sooo well and we are always here to cheer each other or help us get up when days are tough. And in fundraising you always have a mixed bag. Honestly there\u2019s isn\u2019t anything negative to say because you are really given all the tools you need to succeed - the rest is up to you.", "cons": "More money is always nice"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Awful management and lack of strategy", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Officer in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most coworkers are knowledgeable and helpful.", "cons": "Five managers in my first year, the turnover rate is scary. It\u2019s all the more problematic because there is no clear overarching strategy meaning that with every new manager, priorities shifted and we started plans over - wasting time and resources. It is frustrating and demotivating. There are also very few opportunities for growth. It also seems like hiring practices are based on tokenism, which is worrisome given the guiding principles of the organization. The environment is toxic and it makes it uncomfortable to share ideas and opinions. Management will not address issues and instead waste donor money hiring consultants. Management also have clear favourites, which creates weird dynamics. I know colleagues who have been bullied by management in attempts to push them out of the organization. Most people working there are miserable. I hesitated to post review because it\u2019s very critical and I prefer to avoid negative posts online but this job took a toll on my mental health and I encourage people considering opportunities with Oxfam Canada to reconsider. I hope Oxfam Canada is able to turn things around as the programmes it implements are really important."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "This organization has a deep problem within its senior management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues were knowledgeable and most were helpful.
