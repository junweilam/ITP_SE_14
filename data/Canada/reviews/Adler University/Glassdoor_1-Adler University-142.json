The university also tried to cover up these incidences in the name of having a good reputation. Would not recommend unless maybe it\u2019s the Chicago campus. Vancouver campus has to many managerial and structural issues. No TRANSPARENCY EITHER! The board of directors hoard all money and resources for themselves yet do not take a fraction of that money to provide proper funding for black students at the Vancouver campus. It\u2019s a horrible university to work at or attend unless you are white or simply don\u2019t mind keeping your head down and staying out of anything"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Fine workplace", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Admissions Advisor in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team, flexible work schedule", "cons": "Salary is a bit below the industry standard"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Core Faculty", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Dec 2018", "job_title": "Core Faculty in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Team.
