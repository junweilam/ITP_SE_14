Most of my colleagues hated working at Waypoint with most wanting to leave or were counting their years until retirement. There is a lot of turnover of employees at Waypoint. Management has a lot of turnover too. Staffing at Waypoint has been in crisis for decades. When I first starting working there I was shocked to hear of a common practice where leadership would 'order' staff to stay longer because of low staffing numbers. Now, the staffing crisis is so bad at Waypoint they have agency nurses all over the place to fill in the gaps and they still can't get a grasp on staffing levels. The Senior Leadership Team's most observable strategy is negative reinforcement and their competency is lacking considering the staffing issues this hospital has been having for at least 15 years. Do not bring your smartphone to work. You are not allowed! Waypoint continues to keep staff who make verbally abusive comments to other staff. Waypoint has a huge issue with staff bullying other staff and their Senior Leadership have no clue how to navigate this. The Human Resources department is useless to allow the amount of bullying to continue. I also noticed there is a huge lack of expertise in the field of mental health. As a nurse I remember trying to learn more about mental health only to find that most of my colleagues had no clue. The grass is greener on the other side. I'll never work for Waypoint again and the day I quit was one of the best changes I've made in my life."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Waypoint job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Penetanguishene, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good starting pay in the field", "cons": "Mismanaged institution.
