I was led to believe that there would be quality leads to convert to enrolments. Upon hiring I was led to believe that it was standard to have at least 10-15 enrolments per month with the leads we would get. I found that after a few months our leads were less, quality was less, more advisors were hired and therefore we got less leads. I found that if you weren't part of \"the group\" and sucked up to your supervisor you were pretty much at the bottom. We were expected on days off to make certain our new leads were contacted or they would be taken away. There was no motivation with pay that's for sure. The salary and commission were fairly low for the amount of work that would go into first of all trying to reach a lead, constant phone, email, texting to try and reach. If you couldn't reach a lead it was looked on as though you weren't trying hard enough. Once enrolled if the student didn't stay at least 60 days we don't get paid commission after all the hard work put into the enrolment. After some time spent working here I could see the writing on the wall. They hire others to replace you while still working here. I found it to be a slap in the face. They have high turnover in this Company so beware. They may say this job is not for everyone. I've got many, many years of sales experience and have never worked for a company that pays so little. Read the reviews before you fall for the talk.
