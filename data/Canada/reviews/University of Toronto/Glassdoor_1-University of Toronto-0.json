To start with the rewards, you do feel like you\u2019re making a difference for students and it\u2019s a joy to work with most of them and get to know them, the campus is beautiful with a nice trail when you need to unwind, staff are generally laid back across this campus (compared to downtown and UTM), there are good professional development courses/sessions as you\u2019re working in a university, and the benefits and pay are pretty good.", "cons": "Leadership is the biggest concern. Both directors have been in the role for 20+ years and are dedicated to belittling and micromanaging their staff and team lead. Ideas are mostly shut down unless they align with management\u2019s ideas, which are outdated. You\u2019ll find that over the last 5 years, all new and older staff have left because of the challenges with leadership. This is something that is well known across the UTSC campus. Due to constant turn over you will have a very high case load for which you get no support. Leadership will ask you to speak to them about case load issues, but when you do, conversations veer towards this being your fault and no changes are made (many staff leave these conversations feeling puzzled). This is somewhat understandable as the turnover is so high and many students are complaining to see a Disability Consultant, but there is little consideration for staff burnout, which is a constant concern among staff. In addition to having a high caseload, leadership will also expect you to participate in programming for students, but this will eat into your time for administrative tasks and there is little consideration for how to manage your case load, prepare, and deliver programming all at the same time. You\u2019ll need to figure out a way to make this work on your own, without dropping the ball on either one. \r\n\r\nThere is an expectation that student needs always come before staffs. Appointments are booked weeks (sometimes months) in advance, and if you want to take time off but have a student appointment be ready to be questioned about your motives, ability to do the job, and lack of foresight (why would you book a personal/medical appointment during a day you need to meet with students?). You\u2019ll have to manage your life in a way that you book any time off months in advance. There\u2019s very little room for unexpected time off in this position without pushback from management. Schedules are rigid here and every hour is accounted for, with the front desk setting all your appointments in advance. This is not a position where you have the flexibility to make your own schedule. At some point, each staff comes to the realization that it's not sustainable to stay at AccessAbility. Unfortunately, with the high caseloads and micromanaging, this keeps you so busy it\u2019s hard to network and get out of this department. \r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a disability, you will be offered very little support, if any, in this position. This is a bit of an odd feature of this department, since your job is to support students with disabilities and you are in a unionized environment. Leadership has honed a tactful way to deny their own staff accommodations and/or make them jump through so many hoops until they give up. \r\n\r\nIf you find yourself in a situation where a student makes a complaint. The initial reaction will be that you are at fault, and you\u2019ll likely be belittled and micromanaged for an undetermined amount of time, with your job security threatened. There is no due process here to investigate student\u2019s concerns and very little support for staff aside from the support you get from other staff who understand how leadership operates and can empathize. \r\n\r\nLastly, I encourage you to reach out to any of the staff here before you consider submitting your resume to see if any of the points I\u2019ve shared are still issues (staff contacts can be found on the webpage). I write this detailed review as unfortunately many new staff are blind-sided by their experience here and unless you\u2019re part of the UTSC community, you won\u2019t know any better (almost all new hires are external, very few  staff (if any) internally want to be a part of this department). Unfortunately, many people across the university know the challenges with the leadership in this office, but for some reason leadership continues to be untouched/unchanged, even in a unionized environment. For this reason, I would encourage you to exercise caution when considering this specific department at UTSC."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good job for student", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Lab Assistant in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good learning experience for students", "cons": "Odd working hours and low pay"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Engineer C in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good Benefits Competitive Wages Great Working Environment", "cons": "Progression might take time due to seniority"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "PhD Researcher", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "23 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Researcher, PhD Candidate in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "flexible work hours, creative autonomy, independence", "cons": "lack of support, pittance of a salary"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2023", "job_title": "PhD Candidate in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Cutting edge research facility - Excellent mentorship", "cons": "- Expensive city - Work pressure - NA"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent work environment.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Program Assistant in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Hart house is a really good place to work at.

Basically, profs fight for little funding and they tend to exploit graduate students and postdocs with very low salary especially those who are not domestic. If your postdoc contract is about to expire, they offer you just minimum postdoc salary (~33k CAD), which is barely enough to survive as a single person in Toronto. The profs are typically very greedy exactly like US ones. Do not be fooled that oh Canada is different from US! \r\n\r\n- As a postdoc, you do NOT have much resources compared to top US/Europe schools. You have to beg for buying a laptop ... You are not given graduate students/interns unless you try to find them. Profs just want to manage you like graduate students and do not care if you end up a low-salary industry job. \r\n\r\n- There is \"almost\" no research-based industry job in Canada! There are but very few in terms of their scope. You may end up a low-salary unrelated and boring job, which can be done by an undergraduate student. The profs do not care. They just want to put in their CV that they had xx postdocs and xx graduate students. \r\n\r\n- Since government funding is limited, UoT and other Canadian schools tend to admit a huge number of students to obtain tuition fees. It reduces the quality of education significantly and increases housing price .... Again noone cares. UoT admins have a secure high-salary jobs. They are typically from outside academia. It turns out that a huge chunk of UoT budget goes to administration instead of research. That is why researchers' salaries are little compared to top schools. \r\n\r\n- In my opinion, quality of life in Toronto is not that good. There are too many homeless people around and the housing is very expensive. It is relatively safe. Do not be fooled that here it is very different from US. It is almost the same. Very similar in many senses.\r\n\r\n- Do not be fooled that immigration is easy in Canada.
