The same goes for supporting students. I got into academia because I really enjoy teaching, wanted to pursue participatory pedagogy, and genuinely care about my students. UofT, I feel, does not. Students are treated numbers and to the University administration, that's what they are, with $ attached.

There are great student support structures (you just have to seek them out) and the career office is doing a lot better about connecting students to jobs. They even conducted some sessions with phds outside of academia, becoming more and more a reality by the day. \r\n\r\nDepending on your supervisor you can have a great work/life balance or a frustrating one. Also, depending on your own dedication and work ethic it can take variable amount of time to finish and there may be extenuating circumstances that can affect how long you stay in the graduate degree (marriage, family commitments, change in research, etc.).\r\n\r\nFinally, the benefits packages are pretty good you have a decent amount of coverage and a spending account (if you do TA work or teaching) that you can put toward major purchases (glasses, contacts, dentist, etc.)", "cons": "The payment scale is pretty bad. Especially compared to the real world. Most students and post-docs are paid below the poverty line and have to supplement their income with TAships or instructor positions if you can find one or contracts outside of the university. The career outlook for students in academia is not very good. We have an overabundance of highly educated people with no place for them to work. A lot of phds are entering the industry instead of academic gigs because the payment scale is much better and there are opportunities. On the industry side they have no idea how to use PHD level researchers nor how valuable our skills can be so the payment scales don't always match up.
