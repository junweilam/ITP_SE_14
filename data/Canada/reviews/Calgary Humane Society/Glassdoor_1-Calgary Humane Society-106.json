You will quickly discover a disturbing trend of employee mistreatment, irresponsible mismanagement and the ongoing suffering of mental health.\r\n\r\nIt's been going on for years, and nothing has changed. The highest levels of CHS don't change or turn over, so KNOW that means everything remains precisely the same as the reviews from years and years back are telling you. This organization doesn't have leaders at its helm - it has rulers. The staff in every department except for one turn over regularly. This is not a joke or an exaggeration. \r\n\r\nOnce the honeymoon of getting a job at CHS wears off, you will quickly realize you are painfully underpaid for what you do and that there is zero appreciation of the skills you bring to your role and the hard work you are continually contributing. You are simply filling a spot in the chain. The ED, HR and a lot of the management team will use you and abuse you until you leave - either by your own realization of the conditions there, or by them letting you go for a contrived reason.\r\n\r\nPeople being fired or quitting is a weekly occurrence. Every time I log in for my shift, I am stunned to see yet another HR email announcing another departure. \r\n\r\nThey wonder why they can't keep people. It's so obvious to absolutely everyone BUT senior management. And with a board that unfortunately does not realize it has a job to manage the top employees, sad to say, you do not want to work here if you have another option."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "As bad as an employer gets", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working for the welfare of animals.", "cons": "The management team are horrific at the Calgary Humane Society.

Often times if you cared about your job and worked hard, this was acknowledged by your supervisors. Professional development opportunities were usually quite plentiful and you learn a LOT on the job from other knowledgable staff and even passionate members of the public. This included anything from animal handling, to conflict training, to financial planning, meditation, etc. The work at CHS gives you a great insight on how to communicate with people and gives you great life skills. Also, the knowledge and expertise that the animal health and behaviour teams brought to the shelter was incredible. \r\n\r\nMental health was taken seriously and spoken about quite honestly and openly which was refreshing. Team leads were given wellness days in addition to their vacation days to help support work/life balance. Other staff were given overtime hours to use as days off. \r\n\r\nManagement put a lot of effort into developing a more positive and open culture (some more than others). This was something they knew was important overall and were making positive steps in that direction. \r\n\r\nDifficult decisions like euthanasia were carried out respectfully. Often times there were difficult discussions and hard days on staff, however communication was honest and open for questions or concerns. For the most part, supervisors, team leads, and the HR manager were accessible to talk to if you needed to. \r\n\r\nStaff discounts were available to all staff on adoption fees, store purchases, training classes, etc. \r\n\r\nLastly, but certainly not the least, the animals. A HUGE perk to the job was access to really any type of animal you could think of. Cats, dogs, birds, snakes, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, mice, guinea pigs, etc. you name it. When you had a break (or sometimes just needed a break), you were able to go and hang out with the animals and form lovely bonds with them. My best memories were hands down all the amazing interactions with such a diverse group of animals, all with there own unique personalities. A lot of these animals had certain past experiences that made them act a certain way, and it was great to be a part of helping them feel more comfortable, learning about them, and finding them a great home. All the staff had a common bond over their love for animals and it showed in how much time and effort the staff put in to making those animals feel comfortable and flourish.", "cons": "There was a lot of staff turnover. This constant turnover meant that supervisors and team leads were busy hiring/training staff and had less time to focus on longer term staff development or bigger projects. Usually this put undue stress, a higher workload, and less support on those employees. This often led to unhappy employees or ultimately those people leaving and starting the cycle all over again. Being a team lead sometimes just felt like being in HR with the amount of staff hiring and morale boosting you were doing. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there was a lot of red tape in place. This is somewhat needed for safety purposes and to ensure accurate information is distributed to staff and the public, however it tended to slow everything down. If you wanted to create change and you are lower on the totem pole, it means that your idea had to go through several layers of management (who are often very busy) to get approved.\r\n\r\nThe salary and pay was very low. As a non-profit there are certainly challenges to paying staff a living wage so it's not overly unexpected, however I know that even at a team lead salary, it was hard to fully support yourself. With the amount of knowledge, expertise, training, and emotional maturity/intelligence that the staff are expected to have, it's hard to keep valuable staff with the wage being so low."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Animals + great team members", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Fund Development Coordinator in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with animals\r\nLots of collaboration \r\nFast paced", "cons": "Limited resources/budgets - non profit life"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Would not recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Animal Care in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Can\u2019t think of any.
