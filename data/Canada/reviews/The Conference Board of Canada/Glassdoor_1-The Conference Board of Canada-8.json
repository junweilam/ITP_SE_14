There has been lots of staff turnover and that\u2019s been hard but it was time for many of them to go.  So many people were being paid high salaries to do the bare minimum while a committed group worked double time for years to carry them. Some of these people were also were the loudest, most negative voices at the table and so entitled. This changeover was needed but I guess we need more.
