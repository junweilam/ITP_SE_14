Amazing new building was a great place to work. Great to have done work that had such meaningful impact.", "cons": "Like most non-profits, salary is well below that of the private or public sectors. Given that all revenue comes from charitable donations, it's understandable that they need to be good stewards of funds. However, this has likely contributed to a high level of staff turnover in recent years. Also, if you live closer to Vancouver, be prepared for a painfully long commute by car or by transit."}], []]
