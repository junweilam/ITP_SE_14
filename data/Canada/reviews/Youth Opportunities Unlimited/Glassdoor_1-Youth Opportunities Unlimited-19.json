I was new to social services, so I really wasn't sure what to expect when I started, but I was pleasantly surprised by how caring, helpful, and friendly all the staff were. I had multiple people on my first day emailing to welcome me to the team and letting me know that I could contact them if I had any questions or needed support, and they weren't just being polite--the team was always willing to answer my questions or help me with whatever situation I had.\r\nI found the management to be supportive, dedicated, and open to change. They understand that it's not always an easy job and strive to assist however they can. When you suggest different ways of doing things, they listen and take your suggestions and ideas into consideration and are willing to implement them to help improve processes and team communication. Overall, I felt supported and listened to while working there.\r\nFinally, they respect your work-life balance by not expecting you to stay late or expecting you to check your phone on nights and weekends, and they are flexible with scheduling (as long as you aren't abusing that flexibility, obviously). I never once felt pressured to check my phone on the weekend or be answering emails before or after regular working hours, which allowed me to unplug and recharge when I wasn't at work.", "cons": "It is challenging work, which can make it hard some days, but it's also very rewarding."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Strong company culture", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Employment Case Manager in London, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent company culture and excellent to see the impact of your work", "cons": "Salary is not competitive and causes high turnover"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Stressful and disorganized", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 May 2022", "job_title": "Employment Advisor in London, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Helping youth achieve their career goals, and assisting in their empowerment", "cons": "Disorganization/Cronyism/ Incompetent management/ Very Low pay."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great service to the youth supported, but very little reason to stay for your own professional growth.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Employment Specialist in London, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits present\r\nGreat service to youth\r\nBe a part of something you can be proud of\r\nFriendly work environment\r\nExecutive Director heavily invested in programming\r\nA good place to start off.\r\nHeartfelt attempt to be inclusive", "cons": "Organization has no interest in making you a better professional\r\nOpportunity for advancement is not only non-existent, it's discouraged\r\nAverage turn around time for most colleagues seems to be around the 3 year mark.\r\nWhile good to start your career here, management has a difficult time believing in various employees ability to grow and develop\r\nSometimes takes inclusiveness too far to the point that it will fight discrimination with more discrimination.
