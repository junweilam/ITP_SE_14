Good benefits plan.\r\n\r\n-Slow days (IFR conditions) give you freedom to relax and do whatever you want. \r\n\r\nAnd you need slow days like this; if you get a few busy days in a row (3 or more) you will contemplate just quitting right there and going home, I know I did at points. Hopefully weather is bad enough in a given week that you get a break every once and a while, if not you'd might as well start writing your suicide note.", "cons": "-When it's busy IT'S BUSY. This was the most stressed I've been at any job I've ever had, and I was here for 2 years.\r\n\r\n-The amount of aircraft and flights scheduled/congested (the reason the job is so stressful and busy) is a direct result of greed. If we had 12 aircraft available they would make the schedule using 14 aircraft simultaneously, completely assuming we would receive more from maintenance. What usually happened is planes would go down instead, and we'd have less than 12 by the afternoon. I've had to YELL at people who would argue with me after I cancelled their flight after I have no other choice, because management made everything so terrible. Literally had no aircraft they could use. I don't want to yell at ANYONE, that's not me as a person. More flights = more money, so let's pack this school with kids from China and grovel to the CCP for cash.\r\n\r\n-Look at the job descriptions for Dispatcher, it's hilarious. They literally list EVERYTHING there is to do at the college \"plus other duties as required\". Instructors fall into this boat as well, they do ramp/scheduling as well because this place is so disorganized. Dispatchers have to learn and do almost everything in flight operations, things you would never even think about doing. And there's only 2 of you dealing with 50+ students/instructors at once, definitely not enough attention given to individuals.\r\n\r\n-Management are just not good people, they heavily distance themselves from the actual operations of this school, as if the whole thing is too much of a bother to deal with. Don't want to elaborate too much further but I'll be brief. They are in a completely separate building from the actual Flight Operations/Aircraft Maintenance shop, and for some reason they see themselves as superior to the actual heart of this school, which is obviously FLIGHT Operations. Oh and I'm sure they get paid handfuls more than any of the operation staff.\r\n\r\nYou'll mostly see them wandering around the college not really doing anything, attending the odd meeting here and there where they just sit around and eat Swiss Chalet every week (good spending of the budget, guys). Or bossing people around and pretending to know how anything works from an operational standpoint. I've had somebody from management team come up to me and tell me he wanted to physically fight somebody else on my Operations team because he \"didn't show him proper respect\"? Literally the management guy and the guy he was wanting to fight were equals in title this was extremely unprofessional; A good summary for this whole school.\r\n\r\nWouldn't come back to working here if they begged me."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Quick to build hours", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Flight Instructor in Moncton, NB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Quick place to build hours", "cons": "Not very much money for lots of work"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "A pilot \"puppy \"mill\"", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "29 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Flying Instructor in Moncton, NB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-lots of flying available \r\n-large fleet of aircraft", "cons": "-toxic management\r\n-not paid for time spent on the ground waiting for students"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Not bad", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Flight Instructor in Fredericton, NB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of flight hours, about 600 per year working with the China program", "cons": "Not paid of pre and post flight briefings, asked to do other work like in class groundschools.
