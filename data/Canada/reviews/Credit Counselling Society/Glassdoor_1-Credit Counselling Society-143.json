Hierarchical . The only valued employees in this company are the counsellors and management, everyone else is viewed as 2nd tier. Sleazy. They do some back door shananagens, and when someone calls them out on it, they make a 1 on 1 or small group meeting with head of HR which gives you convoluted answer which does not answer the questions. And you feel pressured not to pursue the topic. Transparency. Management actively tries to fog the lens / trench each person in, so they do not share any information. Political.
