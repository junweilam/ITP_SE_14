Organizational goals and KPIs are straightforward and easy to grasp.", "cons": "Extremely difficult to move up in the organization, even when there is more than enough credibility and proof to back up a pay raise and title change. Most lower paying jobs do not have promotional tracks to follow. There seems to be hesitancy in creating new jobs and the organization would rather hire people into short-term contracts, outsource as much as possible and/or expect employees to do the jobs of multiple people. Expect to be told \"you will be wearing a lot of hats\". \n\nIncredible ageism amongst colleagues, especially at the executive level. Staff are consistently told that executives want our feedback, but then never include those at the bottom, which skews younger, in their focus groups. Instead, you will be prompted to fill out a survey asking if you have feedback \u2013 do not worry, they will most definitely NOT implement any of the feedback and continue emailing you about surveys. It's the never ending survey loop, with responses like, \"we will chat about that in a month\" and \"I'll get back to you on that (never gets back to you, even with multiple follow up emails). When feedback is addressed, executives and higher-ups speak down to employees and act like the feedback responses are silly and not worth answering in full. How can a company ask for so much feedback but then decide it's not worth their time to figure out solutions? Even when half the time amazing and thoughtful solutions are provided by staff themselves? \n\nThis organization loves buzz words. Be prepared to hear lots of them like, \"you should be willing to take on responsibility and leadership roles within their team\" when you are in a non-managerial position (this basically translates to \"we want a manager for the salary of a non-managerial employee\") and \"we\u2019re not a company, we\u2019re a family\". These and more are thrown around a lot, but realistically the work environment is more often than not a toxic one, filled with cliques, guilt trips, crossing professional boundaries (people will message and email you at 11pm and on weekends) and favouritism. \n\nHuge turn over! Most employees leave after 2\u20134 years due to a variety of reasons. In three years, large turn over happened in three different departments, with anywhere from 3\u20137 people leaving all at once. This puts a massive amount of strain on the remaining employees to fill in those gaps, as filling those positions usually takes months. \n\nLastly, in 2017/2018, a few employees tried to create a DE&I committee, and was reluctantly shut down at the exec. level. For years, people have tried to create a more welcoming place of work, to be shot down again and again. It was only after 2020, during the height of the BLM Movement, that the company decided to jump in and create a DE&I committee. Why didn't the company feel the need to create one years earlier when requested and promoted by staff? I also find it strange that the majority of lower paying jobs are usually held by BIPOC employees, where as stated earlier, almost have little to no room to grow and move up the corporate ladder."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great experience gained in the international development sector", "cons": "Travel schedule is very heavy and can be difficult to manage"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Poor organization culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Director in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Dedicated and very diverse colleagues", "cons": "Workload incredibly high \r\nLimited advancement opportunities"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible Management but excellent programs", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Content Writer in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The programs team is wonderful - incredibly well educated, they have the strongest monitoring and evaluation I've seen in a long time and they are accountable for their actions.", "cons": "Any team on the marketing side of the house treats you as disposable.
