As a part of the core leadership team or even a consultant, you can expect to receive fantastic pay for very little work. It's a win-win situation for you! However, if you're a manager or below, you may have a great chance to grow your portfolio, but be prepared to be delegated work outside of your scope. The only hope for our students is that the new students union is loud and strong these last couple of years. Look, let's be real here. The benefits may be fantastic, but is the compensation really worth it when your job description takes a hit for every position cut made? It's not fair, is it? And don't even get me started on the words from our so-called \"great\" Human Resources team. I've heard them say, \"If you don't like the pay cut, then leave.\" That's not how you treat people, folks. I mean, come on. We all deserve to be treated with respect and fairness in the workplace. And that means being compensated for the work that we do and having a clear job description that isn't constantly changing due to position cuts. So, to sum it up, the benefits may be great, but it's important to ask yourself if the compensation and treatment are really worth it in the end.", "cons": "Unfortunately, what I've observed is that bullying is celebrated at a so-called \"leadership\" level. It's unacceptable. What's even more concerning is that our own athletes get bullied by the assistant director who represents them. The cross country and indoor track team was even cut by mistake, and yet, no repercussions followed other than an apology. These athletes come from all over the country to play for our sports teams and can't even have a bias-free space to live in.
