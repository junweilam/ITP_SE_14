The boss is at the top, and they know best. If you're a junior staff member, it can be hard to speak up and be heard by your senior leaders. \r\n- Lack of mobility: It's difficult to move up in units/departments. If you're early career, this can be extremely frustrating, and you might just leave to get that experience you so badly want.\r\n- Expensive to work here: UBC's salaries may be high, but geez, they really suck it back out of you if you drive to campus. Parking on campus is about $100/month and food options on campus are expensive. Combine this with the high cost of living in YVR, and your paycheques may not go that far. Not really UBC's fault, though.\r\n- No telecommuting: While UBC published a telecommuting policy in recent years, many departments and units fail to follow it. Our unit isn't allowed to telecommute unless it's an emergency or on a once-off basis. This is an outdated approach to work. If UBC wants to recruit and retain talent in a city as expensive as Vancouver, they need to implement a campus-wide telecommuting policy. For real, this time.\r\n- Vancouver vs Okanagan: There's some grumbling back and forth between campuses. We're technically one university, but it can be challenging to communicate or align resources equally across both campuses.\r\n- Lack of engagement among staff: I find UBC to be so enormous and inaccessible as an employer brand, that I don't feel like I really matter here. It would be nice if the university could find a better way to make employees feel engaged with UBC.\r\n- No meritocracy: There's a fair amount of nepotism here, and under-performing staff are not dealt with appropriate.
