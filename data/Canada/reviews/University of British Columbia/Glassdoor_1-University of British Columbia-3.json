With regards to teaching duties, graduate students are usually paid for a number of hours that is grossly underestimated, leaving us with two choices: (i) either we stick with the number of hours we are paid for and we deliver a mediocre experience to undergrads (and are rewarded with bad reviews), or (ii) we spend more time than we are paid for because we feel bad for our students. It really makes us feel like we are just there to publish papers and give grades to undergrads, with no regards to the quality of education or well-being of undergrads and grad students. Moreover, little to nothing is done to help us find career opportunities. Especially for graduate students, no networking event has ever been organized in my 4.5 years at UBC: never have I met anybody from industry at UBC or at an event organized by UBC.
