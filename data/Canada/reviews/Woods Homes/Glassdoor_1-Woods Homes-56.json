I've read many of the reviews on here and while there is some validity in all of them, as someone with a more intimate knowledge of this place, I'd say that there is just as much sensationalism in them as there are facts, or at the very least isolated incidents are spoken about as though they are the norm. - Great training opportunities both internally and externally - The current CEO is truly driven to make this the best organization possible for the clients and the staff. The agency has come a long way in his time in that role and still has a ways to go but it takes time to alter the culture of a workplace - Diversity is a priority in the agency, this is evidenced in the Indigenous Services, the championing of LGBTQ2S+ community to name a few initiatives - The benefits are good for the most part (see advice to management). The pension is great though. It's a matching plan that really adds up over time. If you are fortunate enough to get hired, GET INTO THE PENSION PLAN!!!!!!!!!", "cons": "- As with any job in this sector, particularly at the frontline level, the hours can be long. It is shift work (for the most part- there are exceptions), it's also not a secret that's kept from prospective employees. The upside to that is that unionized employees can get overtime (and there usually is quite a bit to go around) - You're not going to get rich here. Wood's can only pay as much as its contracts allow and unfortunately, the provincial government is just not putting as much money into children's mental health as they could be. Unionized staff get guaranteed annual increment raises though (and no, management do not get extra money for higher occupancy, to dispel a myth that shows up from time to time) - You will be faced with crisis and some heartbreaking situations. Kids come to Wood's for a reason, and it's not because things are going great at home or wherever it is that they come from. Unfortunately sometimes these situations do escalate into aggression. While it should never be said that anyone signs up to get hit or injured on the job, it is an unescapable reality of this kind of work that it could happen and sometimes does. You'll get TCI training to help prepare you for this and one of the things you'll hear over and over in the training is to not put yourself in a situation that poses an unacceptable risk. Nobody is going to tell you to get yourself hurt. - There is an unbalanced public narrative, mostly from former staff who's motives I don't want to speculate, that it is a job that is full of violence and nothing but abuse from clients. As I mentioned earlier, this can happen and sometimes does however not nearly to the extent that some other postings would suggest. Even as a frontline staff, I had far more days that were full of laughter and fun with kids than I did days that were full of crisis and violence. If you use the crisis well, it is an opportunity for you to learn your craft. If you choose to see it as something that is about you and not about the client and their own trauma, you're likely to get stuck feeling like you're being done to - It can be easy to feel disconnected if you are in the community programs vs the campus programs. There are many things you can do to help with this; you can take shifts at other programs, volunteer for some agency events (the gala is always a fun one to attend as a volunteer) and be active in the social club. The more you get to know people, the more fun you'll have.

The staff is completely dispensable with a high turnover rate. In my program there were multiple staff who had no educational background in mental health, which meant that clients did not receive the care they deserve. To name just some of the abuse I saw inflicted on clients: improper restraints including choke-holds, locking youth in their rooms for multiple hours, homophobia and transphobia directed at queer youth, verbal abuse and the use of restraints when they weren't necessary. These staff did not have the education or skills but were kept in the agency because the programs cannot afford to lose staff due to high turnover. \r\n2. The staff who are kept in the agency are the ones who \"manage\" the youth, rather than support them to heal. Almost every staff who I interacted with at this agency with more than 3 years in the agency were completely burned out and suffering from compassion fatigue. They complained about the youth constantly rather than providing them with a trauma-informed, healing environment. \r\n3. Woods Homes claims to be clinically informed and provide clinical supports for youth, but the turnover of Clinicians is insane. While I was there 1 Clinician was supporting up to 4 programs and seeing youth less than once per month, leaving frontline staff with no clinical plans to implement with the youth, making us essentially glorified babysitters. \r\n4. Management (even at the level of Team Leaders) holds the belief that since they had to go through it, so do frontline staff. This means that assaults, re-traumatization, vicarious trauma, etc. are seen as normal and acceptable parts of the job. Though I understood that these things can happen when working with complex youth, management is extremely flippant, don't check in on staff, don't offer mental health time to take care of yourself following these events. You are consistently gas-lit and told that what you experienced wasn't trauma and wasn't abuse or assault and expected to show up to work the next day."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Needs a lot of work", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Youth Worker in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with children, fun, busy, positive friendships, lots of training, some opportunity", "cons": "A lot of gaslighting from management, high burnout, disregard for staff"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Can learn a lot", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Youth and Family Counsellor in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits, unionized, lots of different programs to facilitate so the amount you can learn is vast.", "cons": "A very cliquey work culture."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Woods Homes YFC", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Youth and Family Counselor in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible, structured, opportunities for professional growth through trainings", "cons": "Lax in safety, lack of screening for qualifications during interviews"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Pretty Great in My Program", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Youth and Family Counselor in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Youth Community Support Program was a great team environment and I learned so much working there.
