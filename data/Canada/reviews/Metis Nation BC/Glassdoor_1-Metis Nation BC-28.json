The leadership often failed to provide any support or directions to staff in their work -- I've heard countless times when colleagues expressed that they had no instructions, no responses, and no support from their directors. The leadership loved playing favourites -- the favoured employees could get away with all kinds of belligerent and toxic behaviours (e.g. yelling at staff in an open office) while the others would be fired for simply looking at a director in a \"wrong\" way. They hired and fired staff all the time. The staff turnover was alarming. \n\nI could go on. Suffice to say, this is a terrible workplace.
