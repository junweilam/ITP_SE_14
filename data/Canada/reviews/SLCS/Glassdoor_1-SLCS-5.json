Completely disconnected from the people they are supposed to be managing. Management spends most of its time doing trainings instead of managing their programs, All management positions are filled with very little diversity amongst the management staff. generally just the worst management I have ever experienced. Management literally stated \"If you dont like it, Leave\" while simultaneously saying that they want to work on retaining their staff teams. They provide lip service to staff complaints but institute NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER. If you have safety concerns when dealing with violent clients they will tell you to suck it up and that its part of the job. I cannot stress this enough either: THERE ARE NO ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. youd be looking at multiple years just to move into a team lead position, which is one step above bottom of the barrel there."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "good first job but that\u2019s it", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 May 2023", "job_title": "Caseworker in London, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good coworkers that support you even on your toughest days", "cons": "Management doesn\u2019t really do what your coworkers do, if anything."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Pros", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Caseworker in Brampton, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great co worker Paid time off", "cons": "Management Large staff turn over"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Don't get paid enough", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Justice Worker in London, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people to work with", "cons": "Don't get paid enough for what you deal with"}]]
