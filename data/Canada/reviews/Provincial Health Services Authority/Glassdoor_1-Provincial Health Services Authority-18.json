The organization values seniority over competence - for instance, if two staff were to apply for an internal position for career advancement, the staff with higher seniority would be favored even if the other staff is more competent to do the job. \r\nThe organization is highly bureaucratic - and i think it is a function of how large the company is. Selection of vacation days too is hinged on seniority. As a junior staff, you are likely not to go on vacation in summer/Xmas because the older employees have selected those prime slots. \r\nOverall, the pay is not that great for the amount of work you put in."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work environment \r\nWorker rights honored - no exploitation of hours etc.", "cons": "Pay is determined by collective bargaining so there are no opportunities to negotiate salary"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "PhSA", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of support and demand", "cons": "Heavy patient loads and long shifts"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Toxic", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "8 May 2022", "job_title": "Advisor in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "easy if you don't want career development", "cons": "Toxic management, from middle management to senior to execs\r\nmanagement is also corrupt\r\nhard to move up \r\nlow pay"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best place I have ever worked", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Business Analyst in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work-life balance, Competitive Pay, Benefits", "cons": "Change management can be a challenging but interesting nonetheless"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "High turnover rate", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "30 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Buyer in Burnaby, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Four weeks of vacation to start", "cons": "High turnover due to Low salaries\r\nVery stressful"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Terrible hiring process", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Penticton, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits for registered nurses.", "cons": "Hiring process was 3 months long and very disjointed with terrible communication from\r\nHR and the manager, and between HR and manager."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Job title", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Project Coordinator in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Opportunities for advance training / workshops,", "cons": "Lack of opportunity for fair compensation.
