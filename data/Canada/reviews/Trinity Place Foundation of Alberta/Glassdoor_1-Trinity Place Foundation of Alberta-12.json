Change is always good, when it's for the betterment of the clients/customers and staff. A 30% wage cut is not a change that's easy to deal with. Also, being held accountable for things you have no control over, or because there are no policies and or procedures in place for most things is also not easy to get used to. Senior management should be busy working on policies and procedures instead of working so hard on getting rid of people. long term employees don't quit because of change. They would have gone through lots of change over the time they've been with the company. Clients don't call the government and have them start investigations because the company is so great to them. They do it, because the changes affect them negatively as well. The housing minister doesn't on regular basis address tenants on regular basis in writing unless there is a serious concern. Funny, one of the questions in here asks if I would recommend this company to a friend.

If you try to take initiative, you might face the wrath of the very insecure personalities in senior management.\r\n\r\nTerrible communication with confusing and poorly written emails / orders from management, as well as multiple management  people talking about multiple different things and issuing multiple conflicting orders and then belittling staff when they seek clarification.\r\n\r\nRampant cronyism (no opportunities for advancement unless you are a good buddy of a manager / director). \r\n\r\nToxic environment (at all sites) which is more-or-less the result of a senior management and Board of Directors that seems to view employees as nuisances that can be ridiculed and, sometimes, punished/reprimanded for taking initiative, bringing ideas forward, making suggestions, questioning unethical behavior, refusing unsafe work, etc. \r\n\r\nI also learned that having this organization on a resume is  a BIG liability because the organization's reputation is very, very poor.
