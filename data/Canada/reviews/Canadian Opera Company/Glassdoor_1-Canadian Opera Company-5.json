They offer a great base plus bonus structure for a part time position.  As a Professional Fundraiser, I did very well here and owe much thanks to Mr. Paradiso for his instruction. \r\nWorking for the COC allowed me to volunteer in other areas of the House. Working for the COC allowed me to contribute hours to CFRE designation. The Staff meetings included words of wisdom from Mr. Neef himself. Small work team, dedicated environment. It is a great place to learn about the Opera and many of those that work in there do for a long time because of the passion for the art. As a person with neurological differences, this was my happy space and enjoyed sharing my special interest with patrons and renewing their interest in Opera. \r\nIt is 2019 and my passion for the COC remains. Mr. Neef did a wonderful job.", "cons": "Strong personalities, drama and tears - all that you expect from an Opera. \r\nWork - Life balance was difficult. When you have a core team producing millions these employees should be on salary with commission and benefits. There were six of us who brought significant amounts and were loyal to the position. The only complaints were about having to get two jobs to support coming to work for the Opera. We were more than deserving of respect.  Our Manager was tough, but I found it necessary for the work we do. No room to further own Opera Career or down time to be a \"Super\" because of the Hours. Leads are paper so not eco friendly and this was difficult for some as the paper waste was great.\r\nA major donor (couple) and underwriter wanted to sponsor my career where returning to England. They gave instructions to a trusted individual in management who was to set me up with this gift - then ghosted me! It was a once in a lifetime opportunity and missed. As a result, I lost faith in the Company because some people saw my youth and special needs as undeserving which is ironic because Music does not discriminate: Opera brings life to people like me."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good company to work for if you need part time work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Feb 2013", "job_title": "Usher in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good wage\r\norganized \r\nartistic environment\r\nflexible \r\nopportunity to move up", "cons": "Rules about appearance are outdated\r\nseasonal so you need another job"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Don\u2019t Work There", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jul 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Other arts lovers usually work there.
