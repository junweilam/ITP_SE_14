My commute was just as far but no one told me I could come in the next day. They told me they were urgently hiring for my position of HR Assistant but on my first day they had nothing for me to do. I assumed it was due to my manager not being in the office and thought the next day would be better. It was not, the next day I still was given nothing to do. On my third shift they gave me nonsense jobs just to keep me busy for part of my shift. They also told me they wanted to improve their onboarding program and really, they didn\u2019t need to improve on it they needed to actually create one. No one could tell me what my actual job was so it resulted in me sitting alone in a back office twiddling my thumbs. I would ask people if they had anything for me to do and they would tell me \u201coh you need something to do... I don\u2019t have anything for you.\u201d \r\nWhen I was told to do tasks, I was told to do them without being given adequate resources to complete them successfully. I truly feel I was set up for failure while being employed with this company. No one ever sat down and explained anything thoroughly to me and when I would ask questions I often felt as though I was irritating my co-workers. \r\nI obviously resigned as I was clearly not a valued member of the team and it didn\u2019t matter if I showed up to work or not. This became abundantly clear as when I sent my resignation in, I had to send it to one of my team members and not the manager, as I was not given anyone's contact information. The team member did not start their day until 9 am, my shift started at 8:30 am. No one called to see why I wasn\u2019t in for my shift. No one wrote back to me regarding my resignation despite them knowing they had a retention problem. The manager never sat down to talk to me about my role and there was little to no training either. Overall the team was somewhat nice but so incredibly disorganized and discouraging. I would not recommend anyone take this position as the company doesn\u2019t know what the position they\u2019re hiring for entails. Big waste of my time."}], [], []]
