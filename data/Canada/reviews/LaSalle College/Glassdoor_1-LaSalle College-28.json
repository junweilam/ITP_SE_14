I can only say that if you're looking for a 3D career this school is not for you.  The only requirement to get in is to be able to pay for the program. As long as you qualify for a student loan, you're in! \r\nYou will be misled from the moment you apply. The admissions office will talk to you about job opportunities and make everything sound peachy (it is literally their job). The fact is, they have very little knowledge about the industry but, mostly likely, you have none, so you'll be tempted to believe what they say. Don't do that! They are in no position to know.\r\nJust like most other private school in this sector, you get out what you put in. But at LaSalle you will be required to put in the bare minimum. While that might sound good (who doesn't want to pass a class with minimum effort?) you'll end up with 2 years of your life spent in school, $50,000+ in debt and no prospect for a career since the work you'll end up will be far below any industry standard. \r\nAlso for the first 4 terms you'll have a lot of full-time instructors that have been there for a long time. While this is fine in itself, the majority of them have not kept in touch with an industry that changes really fast, so the methods that you'll learn will most likely be obsolete or just plain wrong. Also, they won't bother pushing you to do better. The school standard is to pass anyone that submits any work, regardless of the quality of that work. In the long run, this is a route to disaster for your career. From what I can see the school is trying to turn every student into a button pusher, no creativity whatsoever. The button pushing will get you results very fast, however, no one wants to hire button pushers. \r\nThis is about as far as it can get from what's supposed to be an art school. \r\nAs far as an Instructor position goes (part time) if you're goal is to do the bare minimum for 4 hours at a time and you don't mind dealing with students that don't really speak English, then this is the job for you! Your hourly rate will be somewhere around $50 an hour, but as far as I've experienced, there are no rate increases. Or at least I never got one since I started. They value you very little.
