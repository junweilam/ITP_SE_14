Though most of the resources you can find on a google search, this is what I can report and contribute based on some facts I know and my own opinions/experiences through working for AHS. Disclaimer some benefits available within the company may not be listed here or may change as it is a long list of benefits and \"pros\" that I am able to share of the year of 2023. Additional money on certain shifts known as shift differential. For example, if you work an evening shift (3pm - 11pm) or a majority of your shift falls into evening hours(12pm-8pm) or after 3pm, you get an additional $2.75 per hour (x3 hours if working 10am-6pm). After 11pm or known as night shift(11pm-7am) you are entitled to +$5.00 per hour on top of your base pay rate depending on what level you have achieved. For another example, currently the starting rate in 2023 is $22.44 and can go up by steps depending on how many hours you have clocked in each step. The maximum level of payment for base pay without shift differential being added as of July, 2023 is $26.80. There is also a weekend differential (Saturday and Sunday hours) of $3.25 which can be added or applied with shift differential included! Example- If you work on day shifts or (7am-3pm) you get your base pay depending on what step you have achieved plus the weekend differential ($3.25). If your work evening (12pm-8pm or 3pm-11pm) you get $3.25 plus $2.75 per hour which works out to be an additional $6.00. Although if you're on night shifts and your hours fall into the weekend or after 12am you get $5.00 plus $3.25 = $8.25 on top of your base pay rate. Holiday hours and overtime pay. If you are employed part time or full time and you are scheduled to work on a holiday (usually you are booked off) or you are asked to stay for overtime hours, then you will be paid double (x2) your pay rate per hour you work. Shift differential and weekend differential depending on what day the holiday falls, will also be applied. So, you could imagine if you worked a night shift falling into a weekend which possibly happened to be a holiday for example, you would make double(x2) your base pay rate plus $8.25 plus $3.75. (Example $26.80 x2 plus night differential of $8.25 plus weekend differential of $3.75= $65.60 per hour!) Although, more than likely you will be booked off these types of days, but will still get paid as if you were at work but only your base pay rate of 7.75 hours but at the off chance you are called to work or have been approved for over time, these are the numbers your looking at. On top of this, if you did work the holiday that was supposed to be booked off you will also gain one day or 7.75hours of what is called STAT or FLOAT BANK. Meaning you can book off a regular day of work and get paid 7.75hours as if you were there. Depending on your department, the breaks include x2-30min breaks or x1-30min break and x2-15min breaks. On your pay stub the hours per day or shift reflect as 7.75hours. If you employed as casual which everyone usually starts off as, you will get x1.5 of your base pay rate if you are working a holiday. Although overtime hours still apply as x2 of your base payrate plus differential depending on what shift you are on. Overtime can range from 2hours to a full shift of 7.75 hours that can be paid to you depending on department needs. Benefits with BlueCross are quite exceptional. Although you pay a portion out of your paycheck for these benefits every deduction day or by weekly. This only applies to full time and part time employees. Full time has obviously better benefit percentages than parttime but still give good discounts for medical bills such as dental, vision, chiropractor, massages, medical drugs etc. which can also be applied to family members/ spouses. Other benefits also include optional life insurance policies of $250,000. Short-term and long-term disabilities paid sick hours that can be accumulated. x3 Personal paid days off plus an automatic 1 paid day off known as a STAT or FLOAT hours which can also be accumulated but must be used before annual dates of benefits renew. Meaning you have automatically 4 days out of the year to use these hours up before they get paid out to you on your paystub/ paycheck if not used within the year. Vacation Hours can be accumulated and used throughout the year. Up to 5 days can be carried over to the next years hours. Whatever you are able to contribute to your LAPP (Local authorities Pension Plan) AHS will match your contribution. Example if you contribute $100 per paycheck AHS will give $100 as well. Investments called \"flex spending\" accounts can be contributed into such as TFSAs and RRSPs. There is also an account called personal spending which has an allowance of currently as of 2023- $900 which can be spent on many things such as phone bills, new electronics, fitness and sports equipment and activities, alternative transportation (transit and bikes), professional development traveling and support to continuous learning for career development. Cultural diversity and people who come from all walks of life. There is room for advancement other than pay rate change such as taking on forms of management duties. Although as far as I've experienced it is kind of limited to who get chosen for training. It really all depends on the management and manager. The Job is an important Job and can be fulfilling.", "cons": "Depending on your department, you may need to stand for long periods of time on hard concrete floors. Must be able to lift a minimum 10 pounds and a maximum of 20 pounds Some areas that require long periods of standing in place can lead to spinal issues if proper ergonomics are not being used such as keeping shoulders back and spine straight. The job is important and should be respected as such, Although more times then others it can feel like we as surgical processors are not appreciated as much as other staff within the hospital. I've personally been even called a \"glorified cleaner\" which is very disrespectful, but it is to be said you'll find these kinds of negative people saying things like this in every work force unfortunately. Regardless the silver lining is that without this job the hospital would not operate at all, kind of like if you were to take out the heart of a human they would cease to live. Just like this example without the MDRD the hospital would cease to give the proper care patients deserve. Furthermore, some days it can feel more mundane and more repetitive than other jobs especially if forced to work in the same area 2 or more times in a row. Repetitive work or working too strenuously can cause injury such as my own experience, I've developed mild carpel tunnel from repetitive lifting. As any workplace there is always petty drama for example some management show favoritism for some coworkers while constantly micromanaging other coworkers which isn't fair but could happen depending on the management in charge."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great pay", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Social Worker in Edmonton, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, great work environment", "cons": "No cons at this time"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "18 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Social Worker in Edmonton, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great working environment, great pay", "cons": "No cons at this time"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "15 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Medical Technologist in Edmonton, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Challenging, decent pay, great team environment", "cons": "Stressful, short staffed.

executive on larger projects.\r\nSome room for upward mobility.\r\nYou'll encounter many wonderful people and contacts here.\r\nThere are a few community events that AHS holds that are actually quite nice.\r\nThe working environment is well-stocked - a cubicle with dual monitors, cabinets, office supplies, etc.\r\nMany opportunities to learn and expand skill-sets from data analysis to people skills.\r\nGet to go to conferences and occasional talks, though this is rare.", "cons": "The politics. \r\n\r\nAHS is notoriously bad at removing poor employees from the work environment. They could be ill-tempered, rude, belligerent, insubordinate, you name it. They could, to borrow from an infamous phrase, \"stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody\" and still not get fired. In the name of conflict avoidance, much of the leadership will default to methods like interventions, mediation sessions, and sit-downs. These are valuable tools, but when they fail to work, the leadership often fails to escalate. I believe that many members of AHS's leadership are there because of seniority or glossy resumes than actual competence at managing people. They are often intelligent and gifted project managers, but struggle with the managing people aspect. Some of them even turn a blind eye to bad actors because they may have been friends who they hired or simply people they've formed a closer bond to. Tribalism is very much common amongst management, particularly amongst those ineffective at their positions.\r\n\r\nThis is also born of the fact that AHS's HR department has a legendary reputation for defending the worst employees and making management's efforts to remove them a tremendous uphill battle. Poor employees often get redistributed to other departments to be someone else's problem so that managers don't have to war as extensively with HR as they protect themselves, their teams, and their clients. If you work with someone toxic, particularly someone who has been around for a while, don't count on your complaints leading to any substantial action.\r\n\r\nSecondly, AHS is extremely top-heavy, with various mid-level and executive managers. On top of this, the government is also closely involved in many projects, there is a difference between Alberta Health (government) and Alberta Health Services (non-government health authority) along with doctors who wield extraordinary power in the province. This can lead to a lot of clashing perspectives and powerful people working against one another. Often times I had to deal with projects marred in political scars from doctors committing nurses to tasks they didn't have the resources to handle; the government looking expectantly for data; and AHS management just weakly agreeing to most of the demands that crossed their desk because of how complicated it was to say no to such powerful, and sometimes aggressive, actors.\r\n\r\nYou will find yourself often doing projects or tasks that are not incredibly meaningful for Alberta's health needs, but serve the egos or aspirational goals of higher level actors who are either well-intentioned but ignorant or just simply wish to add another publication to their resume. This does not mean that you and your team does not exert some influence or that there are not people in the upper echelons fighting the good fight, just be prepared for situations that force your eyebrows to new-heights as you ponder upon the utter absurdity of certain requests or job assignments.\r\n\r\nI believe the positives of my experience outweighed the negatives, but I also had an exceptionally wonderful team (aside from a one or two people) who I was extremely sad to part ways with. I also had a wonderful manager too. If you don't have one or both of these things in your court, then the politics will make your life fairly challenging here."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook":

From Private - Public (government). AHS is the worst I have ever worked for. It begins with management, they are disengaged and focused on only one thing! money, money, money. \r\n\r\nIts also the most toxic environment I've ever had to work in as well. I'm not someone who gets involved in work politics, however watching from the sidelines I can see how management doesn't follow their own policies on professional behavior and respect in the work place.\r\n\r\nThis is the first and only employer which I have felt like nothing more than a number. We constantly run short staffed because they leave vacant positions vacant. We don't have proper supplies or equipment. We are constantly trying to \"make things work\". Through it all, when we're being asked to work harder & harder, with less & less, we're never appreciated. Not once have since joining AHS have I been told, thank you for you hard work!, or great job! Nothing like that. \r\n\r\nThey \"pride\" themselves on patient and family centered care, however that's only followed if the budget allows. Otherwise, the feeling is patients are nothing more than a number as well. \r\n\r\nAs well, your career opportunities are very limited here. Moving up the ladder is next to impossible unless you're willing to step on your colleagues along the way. \r\n\r\nOverall, I feel that I cannot perform my job the way I was trained to. I'm a caregiver and to me the patient comes first. I've never seen an organization so focused on money and budget. As well, the benefits and pension offered here do not out way the negative impact on my career aspirations and overall mental well being. The culture at AHS is not a \"just culture\" and does not follow the values that AHS laid out for themselves."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Nursing at AHS", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 May 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse, BSN in Oakton, VA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place to work at", "cons": "More staff parking should be available and/or for free."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Terrible place to work, the only culture is YES BOSS", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Nov 2020", "job_title": "IT Analyst II in San Francisco, CA", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary and Sick time(which has to be approved)", "cons": "Coffee is not free, have to pay from a vending machine.\r\nSome co-workers do not share their work.\r\nEveryone is busy with politics rather than work.\r\nSeldom do people share their work with others.\r\n Managers even quarrel on call with the vendors about their territory."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Abc", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 May 2021", "job_title": "Social Worker in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The pay is good and benefits", "cons": "I didn't like shift work and working overnight"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good Benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 May 2021", "job_title": "CRC I in Dallas, TX", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good company to working with", "cons": "No major requirement or problem."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Admin", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Myrtle Beach, SC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with people, pay is good for the job", "cons": "Can be a clique type of atmosphere"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Warehouse", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "17 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Stores I in Chicago, IL", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good easy day to day", "cons": "No wage increases, micromamagement, beaurocratic, difficult to find other opportunities, and lack of vision"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "supportive workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Occupational Therapist in Edmonton, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can always find someone to help, good for expanding your knowledge on different topics of interest.", "cons": "Work tasks can get repetitive."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Cardiology Technologist in Edmonton, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pay is better than most other provinces.

I was let go over two years ago shortly after finding out I was pregnant as they \"eliminated my position\" and I still feel the after-effects of the awful experience. \r\n\r\nI was reprimanded for:\r\n\r\n1. Registering for too many courses on the Learning Management System. My boss literally pulled up a list, printed it out and counted it before reprimanding me about it - I'm not sure what the problem was, but it was worth pulling me into an HR meeting about it.\r\n\r\n2. Booking medical appointments. I had surgery a couple of weeks prior to working at AHS and had post-surgery follow-up appointments. I was trying to get pregnant and needed medical intervention, which required specialists who worked daytime hours. I can say it now that I have a healthy and happy child, but I wasn't comfortable disclosing this the medical reasons to my boss at the time and I didn't appreciate being reprimanded about daytime appointments, especially given that this is a healthcare organization. My boss did request doctor's notes for *each* appointment, which I gladly provided. I asked to work extra hours to bank to make up for medical appointments and that was not only kayboshed, but was an offensive suggestion. This \"issue\" (?) was also brought up in the HR meeting. \r\n\r\n3. Not completing \"busy work\" on time despite meeting internal client deadlines. I was apparently hired for my skillset, but was tasked with doing work that wasn't exposed to in the past (and didn't get absolutely any coaching on), and was reprimanded for not making fast progress on it. And when I did complete work for internal clients that did speak to my skillset, it was dismissed because it wasn't a deliverable specifically for my boss. My boss's busy work took priority over internal client work. \r\n\r\n4. Using a tablet to take notes. I have a highly secure device that I've been using to take notes. It is as safe, (if not *more* safe) than a physical notebook since it was password protected. I write slow and can't capture notes as quickly as I type, so it's the #1 tool I use to stay organized. This was taken away from me because it sought to be a security issue. The worst part of it, is that my boss had her assistant investigate the concern with second-hand information instead of me speaking with IT directly. Her assistant asked IT if I can use \"my iPad to record meetings\", when really, I was just using my Surface to write notes). IT shut it down right away, obviously, because the information given was inaccurate.\r\n\r\nI was given only one week to be come oriented, and within the first week I was tasked with real client work - which was exciting for me, and I completed, but it wasn't good enough because I hadn't started on the busy work yet. I was micromanaged. I was middle management and was expected to be my boss's \"puppet\" and micromanage the team that reported up to me (who was remote, by the way), which I was not about to do. Leadership was passive-aggressive and absolutely top-down (hence my point #3), and when I wrote a letter to higher leadership about my experience after I was let go, not surprisingly, it didn't go any further. \r\n\r\nIt was basically a personality clash that went sideways really fast, and HR was not about to support a new employee (myself) over someone who has worked there for many, many years. HR was present to protect the manager. After the HR meeting about the LMS courses and my medical appointments, I disclosed to HR that I just found out I was pregnant, and for the first time, cried out of frustration and helplessness. I then got let go a few weeks later.\r\n\r\nI am extremely valuable in my field of work and this experience left me feeling feeling undermined, and quite frankly, traumatized.
