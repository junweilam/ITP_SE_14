Please just take the MANY reviews into consideration before deciding to work here. If you are looking for a job where you want to help people - do yourself the biggest favor and seek other opportunities.

E4C is not it - management dosnt care about the youth in the programs, they are not trauma informed, do not care about employee burn out, lie to employees, talk poorly about front line staff, and have the mentality that firing employees who don't fit in or treating the ones that don't poorly is an acceptable way to run an organization that prides itself on \"harm reduction\".
