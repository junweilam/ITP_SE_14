Bullying and intimidation runs rampant throughout the institution with numerous enablers and bullies promoted to positions of leadership. \r\n\r\nLeadership doesn't always know what staff does before letting them go. This leads to cancelled agreements, broken fiscal deadlines, unnecessary and exorbitant student fees, and partnerships ending badly. There are often no succession plans when people are let go, due to instant dismissal followed up by security escorting them off property. Much of the overtime worked by support staff is damage control due to this. This happens too regularly and is demoralizing for those who remain. \r\n\r\nDragging the names of former employees through the mud to absolve any in house responsibility is a typical trait of middle management at Olds College. Some leaders even share the gory details with other departments when they have fired someone.\r\n\r\nThere is no opportunity for advancement. Olds College would rather hemorrhage budget money to recruit a new leader than promote a frontline staff member with proven loyalty and ability.
