You're constantly having to ask permission to do things (or, as an example, you must wait outside of the lab room for someone to go and open the door for you before you TA, because they don't trust you enough to give you access to it), people don't tell you what you need to know when you need to know it, you have to constantly nag some people to do things they said would get done weeks or months ago, etc. Overall, it feels like the administration doesn't care about their graduate students/TAs, it makes very little effort to improve things, and it only cares about protecting itself. \r\n\r\nGiven that the pay is quite low, and the benefits are nearly worthless (For example, most of what you need/want is covered by the alberta health care system, and the university's health insurance doesn't cover most of the things that the alberta health care covers), I would strongly advice anyone against going to the U of C.
