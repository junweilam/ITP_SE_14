It was great to work with an organization that walks the talk, that has respect and consideration for the people they work with and work for, and for involving more people from the communities they are serving as project leads. I like that TIG is a youth organization that works for youth and with youth to ensure that youth voices and perspectives are included in the projects. Being able to lead a complex project was challenging but a really good growth opportunity for me, both personally and professionally.  Leadership trusts employees to do their work well while challenging them to nurture their strengths and go out of their comfort zone.  This trust allows employees to do their best work. Working at TakingITGlobal really felt like being part of a family and I will always be grateful for that experience. Even though I no longer work at TakingITGlobal, I am still involved in the organization as I believe they do good work for youth in Canada and around the world.", "cons": "There were no significant cons"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great for young people trying to break in to the sector.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "young talent, able to make your ideas come to life, creative work space, great people to work with, freedom with your projects.", "cons": "very low pay for hours expected, disorganized senior management, top-down heavy, quick to drop programs to start new ones, quantity over quality."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Fun, formative, & impactful", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Project Manager in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Have a real, tangible, positive impact with an established global nonprofit!\r\n-Many opportunities to take on new challenges and grow professionally\r\n-Staff and volunteers are smart, interesting, and friendly\r\n-Lots of encouragement and feedback from managers and peers\r\n-Weekly staff meetings facilitates a good culture and communication\r\n-Solid network of members, partnering organizations, and companies\r\n-You can have freedom and creativity in your work", "cons": "It is somewhat unstructured, which is common to smaller organizations.
