Many times my manager took on my responsibilities so that I could shadow and develop. I used this knowledge to better complete my duties and communicate to my employees with a better understanding of the 'big picture'. \r\n\r\nThe mentality of SSW in terms of work ethic is to get the job done - no matter where you're located. The flexibility to show up when needed rather than a hard start and finish time helped my family life immensely. There are times I had to work at home after the kids went down, but it was a tradeoff to coming in late in the morning. \r\n\r\nThe people here are a family and will assist with requests if they are able.
