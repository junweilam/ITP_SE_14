Everyone is afraid of losing their job so the culture has become antagonistic to creativity, peer support and the development of trust. Top leader actively supports this by making it extremely obvious who their select favourites are and everyone else is put in the box of \"not getting it\" or basically irrelevant and dumb. Never have I worked somewhere where the leader makes it SO obvious as to who they like and do not like. This department effectively functions as a two-tier system of people the leader makes clear are much more valuable and more important than the rest who are essentially silenced. Watch out, if you're someone who they doesn't like/believes adds value then your opinion, skillset, experience, expertise is basically irrelevant."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management is a boys club", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jul 2018", "job_title": "Analyst in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits.
