Your application to offer process is going to take 2-3 months at best. Contracts get terminated early all the time without cause (yes, it's legal they built it into several job groups) if upper management doesn't like you or needs a scapegoat and they \"disappear\" folk all the time. There were at least 4 people during my 2 years that just suddenly weren't there without notice or explanation. The institution is the most siloed of any institution I have worked at which includes 3 other U15 institutions and communication, even within departments is slow, lacking forethought or deliberation or non-existent and worse inter departmentally. Internal talent with experience, proven track records and good rapport with direct reports are often passed over so that they don't outshine the folk above them or actively pushed out. If you have a middle management position beware the toxic environment above you as many of the executive suite's expectations border on exploitative of their front line staff in student affairs. Again, you'll be recruited with promises of work life balance but once on the job, you'll be expected to be accessible via email at all times, expected to work without credit on weekend and evenings without time in lieu and there is no leeway should you suffer any setbacks in your personal life. Of the U15 institutions, Dalhousie has an average pay BUT the worst benefits with minimal eye care & dental coverage, no personal spending account and no employee fitness initiatives. This is also the least valued I have felt as a female at a U15. Male colleagues were not held to the same standard and were assigned plum assignments with opportunity for growth while the females, myself included, were often assigned the volunteer work that meant working outside of office hours, on your own time with less prestige and little to no credit for the work being put in.
