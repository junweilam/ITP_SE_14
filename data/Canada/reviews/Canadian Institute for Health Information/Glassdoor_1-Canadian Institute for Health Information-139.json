Bullying issues have known to be ignored by senior management and HR (even though they document them- they only pay lip service)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Product Planner in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "accommodating, flexible, great benefits, remote options", "cons": "Parking not great for location"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Wonderful environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Java Developer in North York, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice work environment with friendly and helpful colleagues.\r\nMeaningful work.\r\nWell laid out processes and procedures.\r\nGenerous health benefits and extra statutory holidays.\r\nVery good work life balance with flexible WFH options.", "cons": "Salary is on the lower side.\r\nSometimes things might be a bit too slow to progress.\r\nTech- stack is not the latest.\r\nRestructuring pops up as a surprise once in a while."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to start a career", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "28 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Senior Analyst in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunities for learning and development suited to those at the beginning of their careers, nice office building, collaborative co-workers", "cons": "No pension plan anymore, some bureaucracy also nothing close to other government ministries, no clear career path past a certain point (people basically are waiting to the person above them moves on/retires)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "A great culture and experience!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Jun 2012", "job_title": " in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very friendly and helpful colleagues to guide through processes.
