If you aren't the perfect brown noser prepare to be bullied and have a miserable time at work. The union hates this organization. Upper management does whatever they want at the expense of the smart folks actually doing the work. Wasteful spending, stupid decision making, I've really never seen such incompetence at a workplace. Morale is horrible. It is such a shame because this could be the best place to work. They really don't care about science, it's all a facade. I worked here for 3 years and during that time I saw almost everyone I know quit/fired. I was actually a long term employee at the 3 year mark and that is disturbing.

Communication between teams could be improve. Shorter term contracts are a pain because you never know (sometimes until the week before) if you are going to be extended - this is a HR, exec issue and funding issue and when you are on the other end it is stressful for life planning.
