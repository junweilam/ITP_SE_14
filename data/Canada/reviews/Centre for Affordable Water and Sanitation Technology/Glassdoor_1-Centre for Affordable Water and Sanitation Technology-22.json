I'm serious. \r\n\r\nThe culture is absolutely terrible. First and foremost, the CEO and senior leadership do not care about work life balance. They go back on their promises. They are beyond fake. They force \"in person culture\" and set their own narratives that are completely toxic. I've seen people cry, scream, & storm out many times.\r\n\r\nRead the negative reviews on this page about the company, we are all saying the same thing. Horrible culture. Bad leadership. Not listening to employees.

Management and staff don't trust each other and there is a loss of credibility of management that happens in cycles - the longer you are there, the more cycles you experience. I see the positive reviews written by \"current\" staff, and I think they are written by new staff who have not yet been through the wringer a few times. It'll come in various excuses from Management (staff don't have the full picture, etc), but it's not true; staff just get trained not to trust themselves. The lost potential breaks your heart after awhile. If only CAWST actually was what they say they are - a constantly learning organization. It hurts to say it, but they are not learning at all, and it's because of management."}], [], []]
