You get hired in those positions because of the connections that you have. Females have more chances of attaining that position. The plus side is that your ego in this position really grows because you are in position of authority and you can finally rule a campus with threats of firing the employees. \r\n\r\nStudents are the lowest concern at the college. This is also a plus, because it means that you really don't have to do job while you are at your job. After all, the main goal of any organization should be to make money. Unless, the students have made a complaint to the ministry. Then the student becomes the most important person until the issue dies down. \r\n\r\nEmployees are also the lowest concern at the college. If a student complains against the instructor, the best way to deal with the problem is to completely ignore what the instructors point of view on the matter is, in fact, don't even tell him that there is a complaint against him. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of saving money; no ones job is safe ever, nor is your salary. If a director barely dislikes you, they can fire you, after telling you that your job is secure and you have nothing to fear. \r\n\r\nAll the upper management is filled with ego. There is a lot of regional directors in absolutely useless places, who are completely out of tune of the needs of the campus and the students and the employees."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Anonymous Emmployee", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 Jul 2015", "job_title": " in Calgary, AB", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly people to work with.", "cons": "Not getting a raise in 3 years people have had to go and get second jobs just to make life easier.
