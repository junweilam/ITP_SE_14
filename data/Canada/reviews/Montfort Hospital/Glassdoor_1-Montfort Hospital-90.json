It did not help that I started at the beginning of the first covid wave, so I cannot speak about 'normal times', if there is such a thing anymore. Took ages to get help from IT, and they switched to the most ridiculous computer system in the middle of the covid crisis without any training or staff consultation, resulting in everyone's workload doubling (in some cases more than that). Staff morale was at an all time low. Did not feel like upper management listened to lower staff members or cared to consult them about hospital policies and projects. Majority of coworkers were aggressive and toxic. It felt impossible to manage the workload without doing overtime, and many staff members around me and in other units seemed to put in some extra time at least here and there. I have left on time once. Very limited options to eat lunch in the cafeteria, and apparently there was more than usual as a 'gift' to employees during covid, cannot speak to before. Bringing your own lunch to work was just about the only option. Unfortunately, the pandemic situation being what it is, even if asked for and approved in advance, time off can always be revoked at the last minute (even though I was non-medical staff), not sure how that would look like post-covid, hopefully it improves. Parking for employees is a bit of a problem."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Clerk job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "20 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Clerk in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "friendly co-workers, great doctors and a fun vibe when on night shifts", "cons": "very understaffed, management can be problematic depending on your manager"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "work review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Clerk in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "amazing job to work, people so nice", "cons": "no cons i love my job"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work, great team work", "cons": "12 hrs can be long"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Nice place to work at", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "24 Feb 2021", "job_title": "RPN in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Family atmosphere, french speaking, part of a teaching institute", "cons": "Lots of calls in on days off, no chance for advancement"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "OK", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work condition, happy people", "cons": "long hours and rude staff"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good place, good people, and bad management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "1 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Financial Analyst in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Contribute to the health system and helping people;\r\n- Plenty of good people trying to do the best they can.", "cons": "Most (all?) of cons are related to management.\r\n- Strong opposition to change of any kind;\r\n- Most managers and up have a nurse background and have little to no idea about what they are doing;\r\n- Administrative services have a skewed perspective about what is important.
