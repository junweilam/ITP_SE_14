Management tends to remind employees who signs the paycheques.  They also tend to over micro-manage and harbours a hostile work environment.\r\n\r\nHigh staff turnover due to the work environment and management, and low compensation.  Board of Directors do not have much of a presence as they only go based off what management tells them.  Staff often do not last longer than a year, and often leave well before their contract ends.    Management can be very condescending especially if it's your first job or you're an intern."}]]
