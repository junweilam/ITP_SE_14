When I stood up for myself and fellow staff, not only did they try to hush me as soon as the words left my mouth, but they created outright lies, denied any wrongdoing and spun it, coming at me as though I was a bug that needed to be squashed. It seems reputation and ego is everything to them, and instead of confronting and investigating internal issues, the answer is to fire any and all staff that expose unsettling internal treatment of their employees. I definitely did not expect this from an agency that is supposed to serve the vulnerable. I guess that doesn't include lower-level staff. They seemed to put a lot of effort into making me feel small and insignificant, and implement abusive strategies when I'd try to stand up for myself.
