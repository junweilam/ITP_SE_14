Colleagues are mostly collaborative, supportive and kind. It's pretty amazing for a large organization. The organization has been going through a series of difficult transitions, for at least the past 6 years now, and I appreciate the effort made to improve diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, and well-being in recent years. This progress seems slow compared to the way things move in the private sector, but I know staff are stretched and I am grateful. My hiring supervisor was very proactive about supporting work-life balance, well-being, and ensuring we had the support we needed. This person is a big part of why I agreed to work with CRC. Despite the cons below, I feel that everyone, including the most senior executives, are doing their best within their capabilities.", "cons": "In my experience, HR practices have been mixed and questionable. During the hiring process, I was promised significant funding for professional development and time off during a difficult time in my life (for a specified time period). After being hired, when I tried to claim that, I received mixed support as my supervisor had changed multiple times. Change is inevitable. However, it wasn't well handled, with little to no acknowledgment that this is an accident/oversight, which in addition to other issues, has made me feel a little de-humanized. This sort of culture has endured for nearly a year, though I have seen improvements that give some hope. As with many workplaces during COVID-19, staff turnover has been high for a variety of reasons and morale has been low based on team-wide surveys, though this has improved as of the last survey in Dec 2022. Of the approximately 12 people I work with the most, only 2 remain. Some folks are overwhelmed with work, though the workload varies. It has often felt hard to feel motivated, engaged and desiring to continue here. Philanthropy is all about building relationships with our donors, yet it seems that relationships within our teams are not sufficiently prioritized. Support varies wildly based on your supervisor, and I've observed that new hires unfortunately lack support to do their job, let alone support their own direct reports. To my knowledge, only SLTs get in-person opportunities to meet for work. It seems smaller teams may no longer have in-person opportunities to meet, not even just once a year (CDO and my supervisor have shared conflicting messages to date)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "admin", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 May 2023", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great management and supportive coworkers.", "cons": "Less pay ,no growth career wise."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Okay", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 May 2023", "job_title": "Coordinator in Hamilton, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Volunteers, clients, community and bakery", "cons": "Too much job for one person"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good coworkers.

While a temp, you have almost no benefits at all (incl. no pension contributions). People are forced to do overtime and they are expected to not declare them. Salaries are much below the average in the not-for-profit sector. Even when one has stood with them long enough to become permanent, they only offer 6-month mat leave and zero top-up. Internal processes are a mess and it\u2019s a highly bureaucratic organization, meaning that a lot of workarounds are needed, systems are inefficient, and everything works at an incredibly slow pace. In an environment where quick action is needed, it is the employees that pay the price: most people are overworked, stressed, and unmotivated. HR is not helpful at all in solving conflicts and tends to either ignore that a problem exists, or make them even worse.
