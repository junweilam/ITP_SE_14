For example, payroll forms are not provided along with your offer letter and rather you have to call someone and get them to email you and then return them back to that specific person instead of filling out all forms and returning to one person to take care of. When you are a part-time sessional professor and have a separate full-time job this makes the whole process very difficult.\r\n- Basic questions on logistics of how classes work for a first-time teaching position aren't provided, people pass off the buck to other people and you have to email numerous people to get an answer. Secretaries are generally useless and lazy. When you email them they frequently tell you \"they're too busy\".\r\n- The school has certain academic policies in place that students are to follow, such as rescheduling exams, which are not followed. Students frequently send emails saying they're on vacation when the exam is scheduled and expect you to reschedule them. When you say no, they approach the administration and administration will then tell you to give them another chance (or they automatically fill out the change forms for you and expect you to sign off on them). This contributes to the poor reputation of the university. \r\n- Administration caters to whatever students want. While this generally maintains good student relations, this provides for an environment where academic standards are sub-par and students are given high grades that they do not deserve. It's no wonder that graduates can't find jobs in the real world and a University of Windsor degree doesn't hold much value.\r\n- If you interested in academics, it's a good institution to get your foot in the door for other opportunities. I can't imagine working here full-time and being proud to be a professor at this institution.\r\n- Pay for sessional staff is approximately $6,800 per course for a 3 month course (12 weeks). While this sounds great, when you think about the after-tax money you're going to receive, it's not worth the amount of hours you're required to put in to make up for the incompetence of administration while teach effectively. Also, you are not provided with any teaching materials other than the textbook and its resources and are required to create the entire course. \r\n- Prior to teaching here, I'd frequently heard this institution being referred to as \"Last Chance U\".
