Faculty teach about twice as many courses compared to a standard university. The teaching load at Emily Carr is 10 studio courses per year or 8 lecture courses per year. Most universities have a teaching load of 4 or 5 courses.\r\n\r\nThe faculty are scared enough of the administration that they avoid using their work email addresses to discuss any labour-related items because they are afraid of managerial surveillance and retaliation. Faculty do not feel listened to or empowered by the administration. \r\n\r\nPay for faculty is low enough that most faculty find it impossible to survive in Vancouver without the help of a partner's/spouse's income. Faculty pay scales are dormant for long term employees. There is little room for incremental pay raises over time for faculty. The faculty do not socially hang out with each other. They are too burnt out.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was considerable promise with the new president  (Sidall) the institution has been unsuccessful in maintaining operating funds and is currently several million dollars short. Management typically operates in \"putting fires out\" panic mode due to lack of resources, focus and strategy.\r\n\r\nThe university has spent all of its money on a building. Investment in faculty has never been a priority. Faculty are treated as disposable.\r\n\r\nI accepted a faculty job at Emily Carr instead of a competing offer from a different school. I was attracted by the art school energy and Vancouver  and thought my teaching load wouldn't matter.
