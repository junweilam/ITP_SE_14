At the root of this fractious culture are two individuals in particular, who happen to hold the most power at the organization: (at time of writing) President and CEO, Mina Mawani, and one individual who has a close relationship to her. This individual influences many of the organization\u2019s key activities and the overall work culture of the head office and its surrounding region. She should not in fact hold such power based on the organization\u2019s hierarchy, but does so by virtue of her close relationship to the CEO; exemplifying the role that favouritism plays in both appointments and overall decision-making.\r\n\r\nMost troubling is the fact that several staff members who live with inflammatory bowel disease had their condition deteriorate as a result of working for the organization. These were all staff intrinsically tied to the cause, who often went above and beyond in their duties in order to help others like them. The majority of these particular staff members reported directly to the individual noted above. For this worsening of health to happen, and happen repeatedly, within a charity whose purpose is to safeguard the wellbeing of people living with IBD is staggering and unacceptable, and again reveals the backwards culture of favouritism that keeps problematic people secure and punishes those who exceed expectations in their roles.\r\n\r\nAll staff are essentially viewed as expendable, as questions surrounding the organization\u2019s ongoing and relatively long-standing history of employee burnout and high turnover are met with paltry excuses and fatalism. When employees leave, reasons that stem from outside the organization are always stated, without any consideration as to what it was inside the organization that drained people of their drive and happiness.\r\n\r\nThere is a glaring inability to focus or think strategically. Hard work is exalted, but not a moment is spent considering whether work is within people\u2019s capacities, whether it\u2019s necessary, how it should be prioritized, and above all, if it is even beneficial for people impacted by Crohn\u2019s or colitis. Certain initiatives are pushed forward - and allocated hard-earned funds - not because they help people with IBD in a meaningful or impactful way, but because they give senior staff a way to claim they\u2019re making a difference.\r\n\r\nAn overwhelming number of competing priorities results in many things being done abjectly, rather than a few things being done well. In the rare instance something is done with quality and in a timely manner, it\u2019s not because of the organization\u2019s work processes, but in spite of them. The constant piling on of tasks pulls staff in too many directions, necessitates frequently working after hours and on weekends, and eventually results in resignations.\r\n \r\nThe organization feels desultory. People with no knowledge of design or UX bark demands for print materials and websites. People with next to no experience in fundraising call the shots for donor relations. People with a rudimentary understanding of IBD decide how the disease should be portrayed \u2013 in one notable case, doing so in a way that offended a sizeable segment of the Crohn\u2019s and colitis community.\r\n \r\nIf you think I waited until after I left to raise all of these issues, you would be mistaken. I raised my concerns, along with ideas for how to improve the situation, in writing and submitted it to senior management and human resources. Over a year passed, and the working environment only deteriorated further. I can\u2019t help but feel as though my concerns were dismissed, if considered at all.\r\n \r\nOne last point, which I think sums up how the organization\u2019s top brass handle problems. There are a few conspicuously positive reviews on this site that appear to be written solely to counteract the warranted slew of negative reviews. I was encouraged to write a similar cheery review during my time at the organization but did not. One positive review suggests that employees who have to take on additional tasks because of the charity\u2019s consistent turnover may sadly not see their exponentially growing workload as a an opportunity for growth.\r\n\r\nGee, maybe that\u2019s because an overwhelming workload that strips employees of any semblance of work-life balance is not an opportunity for growth. Twisting the realities of a difficult situation, and whitewashing a multitude of genuine issues rather than addressing them illustrates how those in positions of power focus solely on self-preservation while completely disregarding the wellbeing of those who work alongside them.\r\n\r\nAny positive reviews written over the past two years should be viewed with suspicion as possible examples of this sort of masking and distortion of truth."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Development role review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Sept 2014", "job_title": "Development Coordinator in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great work life balance, generous vacation and comp time, generally positive co-workers", "cons": "-old office, not a lot of room for development and growth, pay is not very competitive,development roles are very broad- doesn't allow for a lot of focus and development in key areas of intereste"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Fundraising", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 May 2016", "job_title": " in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are some great people who work there, who are willing to go out of their way to help.", "cons": "Office politics.
