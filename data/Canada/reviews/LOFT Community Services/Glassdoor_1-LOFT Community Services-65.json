I found my encounters with management and the CEO as disingenuous. If you have issues or concerns, they are minimized and management often never comes back to the table with a solution, even when promised. Expenses and mileage are not paid on time and you lose money if your role doesn\u2019t require you to start at the office each day. No accommodations are made, you either swallow your issues and fall in line or be branded a trouble maker. During the \u201camalgamation\u201d process there were many promises and portrayals that turned out to be false. When there was complaints about losing money due to LOFTs expense set up, our old company was blamed for not doing things properly. However when we brought information from CRA to the table that it was proper, it did not matter.. no accommodations would be made."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 May 2023", "job_title": "Peer Support Specialist in North York, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people to work with in supporting community", "cons": "Working from home and remote can lead to feelings of isolation"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Toxic Work Environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "11 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Many coworkers are wonderful people.", "cons": "Stressful working environment with lots of conflict.
