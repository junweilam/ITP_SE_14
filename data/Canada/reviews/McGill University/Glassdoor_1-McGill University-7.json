This has the combined effect of confusing the lines of how far your responsibilities extend. back stabbing: HR is not involved in culture management and since this is an academic setting, the same values of academia permeate throughout the administrative jobs; in fighting, backstabbing, rumours, and cliques become a problem and everyone has to work to protect themselves from their bosses and other people's bosses. Often, promises will be made and broken on the standpoint of fairness pulling from the bottom. Ex.: you do work above your level, and so, you want to be promoted to this level. But since the work you were doing would garner too high of a salary jump if your title would match your work, you can see yourself being put in a higher position with either, the same title and a derisive improvement in salary; maintained on the same salary but with a higher title; or to just be forced to work like that with no change, while someone gets hired from the outside to do the job you were doing so as to \"relieve you from these duties\" also.. you would have to train them. The union has too limited a reach so it can't protect you from the micromanaging motherf***ry of your superiors the HR methods are too opaque to be engaged with. ex.: the yearly reviews are so complex, you need training to do your review and even then, you're not sure to understand.

There are multiple collaborations between industry and the university which makes it easier to find internships. If you wish to move onto industry work there are several programs here to serve as a launchpad.\n \nMontreal itself is a vibrant city with lots of opportunities for career progress, especially for biotechnology and sciences. It's young and hip and a lovely place to live in.\n\nMcGill student services are decently organized as far as the nationwide standards go. As it is an English-speaking university, it's easier to access services on campus even if your French isn't great. \n\nIt's a large university with a lot of interdisciplinary programs, which I believe is the future of all academia. Gone are the days where a Ph.D. meant getting expertise in a very narrowly defined area with the hope of becoming a professor. Ph.D.s today are more likely to go on to work outside academia, which makes this university particularly attractive to those who want to gain expertise in multiple fields and skills that would make you a better industry hire.", "cons": "All of my cons are focused on the salary. \nThe minimum stipend for my program not only has not increased in 10 years but it was actually decreased in 2017. Based on a 40-hour workweek (a laughably low number for most graduate students), the minimum stipend is <55% of the minimum wage. After tuition, your take-home amount is ~50% of the calculated minimum cost of living for a single person in Montreal (based on 2020 data).\n\nLike many North American universities, graduate students here are underpaid, overworked, and undervalued. They are meant to produce research that can make the university money, none of which go towards increased salaries for actual researchers. There are no centralized unions to negotiate salaries across departments and therefore stipends vary widely across the board. There are also little to no legal protections for the labour rights of students (although this is more on the province & country).\n\nIt is quite jarring if you come from more organized (and better) universities in Western Europe with legally mandated minimums, labour rights for graduate students and transparent negotiation schemes and tracks for advancement. I have to assume this will eventually lead to a brain drain from NA to the EU."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "No", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Research Associate in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good space to work and career", "cons": "Cannot provide a Validated Job Offer (VJO)"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Mar 2022", "job_title": "PhD Student in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "they also pay for my tuititon and some research trips", "cons": "The administration can be a pain to work with"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Research Analyst in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "research, data collection, analysis and framework development.", "cons": "there arent any cons, highly beneficial and educating experience."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Think again", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "30 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Intern in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable work environment makes things easier.", "cons": "Little control over work hours and job responsibilities."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "DO NOT DO A MITACS PDF HERE", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Montreal, QC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None.
