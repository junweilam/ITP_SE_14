Traditions and old ways are not always bad, but not being able to see the bigger picture and not working as a team is the biggest downfall of this club and especially the Food & Beverage department. This department makes the most money apart from Membership, but is always the first to be blamed and is also underpaying their staff. \r\nFor years staff are making the bare minimum, students are expected to perform at a very high level with zero experience. \r\nSexism and tying into unfair wages/promotions is also very common. Male staff are often paid a lot higher and offered promotions automatically while there's been many cases that female staff are always not good enough, even though their work ethics is much better. \r\nSome of the Senior management staff in the department are very rude, respect is to be earned and not expected. \r\nVery glad I am not under this toxic work environment anymore. \r\nThere was absolute zero work/life balance and regards to your level of sanity.\r\nAlmost forgot to mention, Board Members' involvement with the department is way overboard and they get too much 'Special Treatment' because management is busy making them happy than the overall well-being of the club/department. \r\nThe culture here is only strong towards the tradition, but staff culture is non-existent."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Race Coach", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2016", "job_title": " in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic summer job, working with great students and at a beautiful club", "cons": "Nothing bad to say about working here"}], []]
