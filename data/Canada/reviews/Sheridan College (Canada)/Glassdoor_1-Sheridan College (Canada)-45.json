I'm proud that I'm in the top 10% in terms of student feedback but I'm never offered any opportunities to teach other courses. I feel sometimes as if I'm kept in a box and brought out to teach every so often. The Academic Portfolio Administrators seem to assign courses based on who they like rather than using any logical criteria. I never hear ANYTHING from the college and I've been teaching there for almost 7 years. Also, I've just started teaching at Mohawk and my hourly rate is 75% higher for a similar course (although my class size is 50% bigger). However, Mohawk is smaller and seems more \"personal\" - we'll see. If you interview there - ask about opportunities to grow. Also - their Centre for Teaching & Learning is too focused on theoretical teaching tools and techniques - as well as DEI. I'm not saying that's unimportant - it's that there are so many practical things to do to make the courses more consistent and have practical value to the students. Many of the CTL staff them have NO teaching experience.
