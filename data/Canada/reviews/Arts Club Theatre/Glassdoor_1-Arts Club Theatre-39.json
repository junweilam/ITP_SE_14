A lot of them no longer work there. You get free tickets to shows. The office is nice. If the senior leaders like you, your life is much easier and you have a fair amount of freedom.", "cons": "A lot of people in the senior leadership team NEED to move on - but especially the ED. If anyone in the Board of Directors is reading this, you need to do something about it now. This is a company that has exploited younger workers (especially young women and minorities) who are eager to get into the Arts industry and think that they might get pay bumps on a regular basis. Instead, they get paid a pittance for years and then told that they should be grateful for the minimal amount of salary received. The Executive Director has said many times that because he was able to live on $32,000/year in 2001, everyone should be happy with that amount now. I've also heard of managers pleading to be able to pay lower-level staff more and, again, the ED refusing flat out. This has meant that I heard from so many staff members who had to skip getting groceries because an unexpected bill suddenly arrived. And it's not like they're hiring all intern-level workers - these are incredibly skilled, hard-working people, many of whom were able to earn 50%-150% more just by moving to another company.\r\n\r\nNot only that but the benefits and perks of the job are essentially non-existent. There's no ability to work from home in regular times, only the minimum vacation required by law, leaving early is allowed but frowned upon even for legitimate reasons, and any expenses related to your personal growth as an employee are usually denied. The health benefits are fine at best. At least if they're going to pay people such below-market salaries, the benefits and perks should be WAY better.\r\n\r\nWhile I worked there, pretty much the entire lower level staff turned over completely every 1-2 years. No one ever really got promoted because the senior leaders have all been there for close to a decade or more, and the mid-level managers all stick around for 5-8 years. So no opportunities for growth within the company.\r\n\r\nThe culture around the theatre has also shifted completely. Once upon a time, we used to be able to talk about what went wrong with shows and joke about productions that we personally didn't like. Now, everything HAS to be positive, which means that many issues & potential areas to improve are swept under the rug.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the last year, the micromanagement and imposition of senior leadership into every aspect of the company has been unbearable. They need to learn that trust, encouragement and setting company-wide goals & metrics to work towards allow people to do their best work, not demanding last-minute Instagram videos with less than a day's notice."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great & Fun Place to Work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Office Staff in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very friendly and helpful staff, very fun environment to work for (especially if you love performing arts / theater)", "cons": "Nothing I can think of."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Mismanaged", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "10 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Front of House Staff in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Get to watch free shows", "cons": "- Upper management and other department heads make no effort in introducing themselves to other employees\r\n- There is no communication between departments, especially upper management\r\n- Actions by other departments get consent without consultation of other departments\r\n- Front of House department doesn't have resources that other theatre Front of House departments have, such as radios for communication between ushers\r\n- No room for advancement\r\n- No discount on shows"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great work environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "31 Dec 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Vancouver, BC", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I spent 6 years there.
