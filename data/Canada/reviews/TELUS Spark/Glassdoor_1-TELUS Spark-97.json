I wasn't a fan of it's focus on catering to high wealth customers to justify charging high admission and membership fees. It's no coincidence that the majority of it's members live in the most expensive postal codes in the city.\r\n\r\nI also felt that there was a very conservative outlook regarding the oil industry and its involvement in environmental degradation.
