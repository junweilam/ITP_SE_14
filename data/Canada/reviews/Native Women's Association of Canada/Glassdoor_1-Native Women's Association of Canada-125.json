They have compromised on NWAC's values in their operation of the organization and have undermined the credibility of NWAC's advocacy.  I wish I could provide more context for this claim, but I truly have never met anyone more manipulative, calculated, or deceitful.  While many of these reviews mention the ED/\"CEO\", we are not just spiteful former employees.  Many were forced out for challenging the ED/\"CEO\" and others left to care for their mental health.  We followed all internal conflict resolution processes, we wrote a letter to the board of directors with our concerns, some spoke to the press - but NWAC just kept hitting a new bottom.  \r\n\r\n- Staff have no job security in their contracts and are often fired without notice and without adequate reason. These firings are frequently defended by management and blamed on unstable project funding from the government (a way they can also strategically advocate for more core organizational funding).  Staff are now made to sign non-disclosure agreements before being given their contracts which I think is for efficiency more than anything else. \r\n\r\n- Constant gaslighting - Staff are made to feel like they are asking for too much. Whether it be an adequate salary (to match the salaries of our project budgets), an adequate workspace with HR accommodations, or approval for overtime to meet the demands of the workload, we were always told there was never funding.  We were told these things are part of non-profit work, which to a degree, was acceptable.  But as time went on, it became increasingly obvious that the ED/\u201dCEO\u201d just operates NWAC in a state of chaos as a way to controlling staff.  When you are constantly putting out small fires, its easy to miss the larger shifts taking place.  \r\n\r\n- Intentionally weak directorship  -  Aside from a few women who are exceptions to the rule, the ED/\"CEO\" has strategically selected people not suited to director and senior management positions.  Most lack the experience to lead their units and senior-level work frequently falls to lower-level staff, but without the recognition or compensation.  For these reasons, many staff leave NWAC without a reference from a supervisor or director.  There are few opportunities for mentorship, especially given the incredibly high turnover rate.\r\n \r\n- Lack of Indigenous staff - I write this as a non-Indigenous former employee but this is incredibly important.  NWAC is a colonized space, which is likely why it has struggled to attract and retain Indigenous staff.  When the lack of Indigenous women in leadership positions was brought to her attention, the ED/\"CEO\" would constantly say that no qualified Indigenous women were applying \u2013 which to her meant no women with law degrees or PhDs were applying.  Leadership does not value lived experience or traditional knowledge, with the exception of several Elder Advisor roles.  Despite advocating for solutions to the systemic reasons why Indigenous women are under-represented in post-secondary education, NWAC continues to favour non-Indigenous folks with graduate degrees and experience in government.  Despite advocating for the economic empowerment of Indigenous women, NWAC has given the highest-paying senior positions (100k+) to white men while the majority of staff are making under 40k."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Overworked and Underpaid staff- Little to no job security", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 May 2019", "job_title": "Junior Staff in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great colleagues who support one another.", "cons": "Salary is low, Staff are overworked, No job security, management is incompetent, when complaints are voiced, staff are not listened to, HR frequently resigns because it is impossible for them to do their job"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Just don't do it", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 May 2020", "job_title": "Communications in Ottawa, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the people are very nice.
