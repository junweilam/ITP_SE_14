They treat disabled employees so poorly and don't hire many visible disabled people, they use them for free labor as volunteers. Another issue is the ASAD program. Flaherty would be rolling in his grave. It has expanded so much (because they need the $3k per student income) they have actually taken over space and program room for the adult day program forcing it to lose out on the life skills apartment as well as other opportunities it used to offer.
