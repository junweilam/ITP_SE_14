You could be an example to follow for hospitals to offer stability. Why do you say on your website and materials that you have 60 years of experience? If so, can you please name 10 employees who have survived more than one year of abrupt changes in your organization?  There is no need to post the 2017 organization picture again and again in 2019. You could be posting the current 2019 picture when you have nothing to hide. Do hospitals post 2017 pictures before a mass lay off? \r\nYou do not know or do not care how much talent costs you to reinvent the organization every year. One former employee mentioned that this organization is going to be taken to courts.  I am not sure how much this organization spends in legal battles but this progressive massive layoff for the past 5 years has to stop.  When you offer the best product in the world, there is no need to get rid of employees all the time because there is a clear direction.
