A total micromanager. Couldn't even replace chairs that had screws sticking up out of them into your rear for the main nursing station, for months. We had to place linens on the chairs for months to block the stabbing screws (apparently after I left as I've been told when something like infection control eventually saw the issue it was resolved despite previously multiple attempts to get the manager to resolve it).\r\n\r\nShe used the cameras inappropriately to observe staff, rather than patients, and punish them based on these observations.\r\n\r\nShe wouldn't support staff who had been doing only day shifts or night shifts and tried to force them to change their schedule after years of it being accommodating to the staff's needs.\r\n\r\nShe removed all the casual staff from the roster. Refused to allow exiting staff to remain casual. Even in the face of the pandemic and chronic staffing shortages.\r\n\r\nRefused to hire new staff for RN lines that had been empty for ages.\r\n\r\nRefused to hire new support workers, using agency staff daily that had never been to the unit, and had no idea how the mental health unit was organized, which caused more work than help\r\n\r\nExpect workplace violence from the patients, and zero support from the manager. Not even a follow up \"how are you doing after that violent assault/ terrible experience etc.?\"\r\n\r\nI'm literally traumatized by the manager's inaction, absenteeism, inability to follow up or support the staff. \r\n\r\nShe wouldn't even approach you with concerns, going immediately to set up meetings with HR and the union, sending a vague email intimidating you that a discussion needed to be had without telling you what the issues were.\r\n\r\nAll of the psychiatrists left within the span of a few months, shortly after I started, as well as the previous PCC and manager (ON THE SAME DAY) which I think was to do with the new medical model which allowed for less of a focus on mental health and started accepting acutely physically unwell, medically complex patients. \r\n\r\nThe ability to provide excellent mental health nursing diminished severely as we became taskmasters just trying to get the tasks done and our heads above the water. Ever since these changes the doctors were on a 2-3 week rotation. So consistency of care was a disaster as many patients would rotate through multiple doctors as their length of stay would overlap or extend past that of the doctors. (I liked the docs though just wish they were consistent). No consideration was made for the fact the tenured mental health nurses had not been practicing their physical nursing skills for years and they were thrown to the wolves to figure it out themselves.\r\n\r\nIIRC 34 beds. 6 of which were PICU. PICU nursing ratio was 3:1.\r\nGeneral side ratio would be up to 6:1 on a day shift, and 9or10:1 at night as they worked with fewer staff.\r\n\r\nThe schedule itself was also terrible, 2 weeks of days, 2 weeks of nights. Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday. Repeating.\r\n\r\nExpect constant sick calls, working short, ongoing safety issues and unresolved issues that management is aware of and ignoring. I've never been happier since leaving that place, though I do miss dearly working with my excellent front line team."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "16 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Clinician in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of opportunity for advancement", "cons": "Not for those who lack teamwork skills"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Dec 2022", "job_title": "IM/IT Analyst in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, good working projects", "cons": "Scheduling meeting is hard as everyone is busy"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Ok workplace", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Registered Nurse in Toronto, ON", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good reputation when you say you work here.", "cons": "Worked as a registered nurse for 8 years and been through many different departments.
