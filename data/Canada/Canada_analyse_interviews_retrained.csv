If you find this please consider wasting your time applying for work here I went to SAIT for the Unit Clerk and Medical Office Assistant program and I did my practicum at Rockyview Hospital my whole professional experience it's been costumer service working in hospitality and other positions as clerk I even hold a bachelor's degree. I wanted a career change. No luck? Maybe but at this point I think it's extremely political to get in I know someone who's working experience never was medical and got hired as manager... Consider also that AHS open positions internally and externally I as an external candidate applied and send over 300 resumes to AHS and I swear to God I'm not lying I even contacted the Unit managers directly from a directory access that I had and hear this out that's how I got my interviews NO SINGLE INTERVIEW WAS FROM THE EXTERNAL WEBSITE NONE!!!!! Also it's worth to mention that at the end of my practicum they offered me an interview I was the last minute last candidate they asked me 5 questions each question is scored and don't forget YOU ARE COMPETING AGAINST INTERNAL CANDIDATES WITH ALREADY MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU if you say what they want to hear or score 4/5 more likely they'll ask you for references then they send a whole document to your references where they score you out of 40 points and then they're supposed to make the decision to which candidate they'll go for also each unit manager will ask you different questions some more difficult than others but at the end it leaves you wondering if you did well you barely make a connection with the interviewer because they're not looking at you or your body language because they're writing down everything you say... So they call you and tell you that there are stronger candidates internally and that they made the decision to choose them... oh and wait... this is a MONTH AFTER you had the interview or even more! Some DON'T EVEN GET YOU BACK! I finished my practicum June 4th and it's exactly August 4th and I already gave up trying to get an opportunity to work with them. It's not to brag about it but it's their loss happily I'm going back to a company I used to work at before because they did express and made it clear several times that they want me back and they have offered me a position. My advice if you have medical experience of some kind go for it apply  take the course I took and apply but if you don't just don't waste your time and don't go to school for this to change your career.,0.99737144,0.0024844112,0.00014409288

I watched the capital health website for the Graduate Nurse Initiative (GNI) posting to go up. It is only posted for a few weeks at the beginning of February. I applied for the position online and was phoned approximately 4.5 weeks later. At this time a date for an interview was scheduled for the following week. I showed up for my interview but nobody was present. I phoned the interviewer's administrative assistant  something had come up and they asked to reschedule for the following day. When I arrived for the rescheduled interview I was greeted by the admin. assistant and asked to wait in the patient lounge. One of the interviewers came out to show me to her office. Two managers were present for the interview and wrote notes during the whole process. They were fairly friendly and attempted to make me feel comfortable with a little bit of small talk (the weather traffic etc.) They both introduced themselves and described their positions a little bit. Then they asked me to some standard interview questions (why do you want to work here what strengths/weaknesses do you bring... etc.). They asked a few scenario questions: Mr. Smith has this diagnosis these are his symptoms. What would you do as his primary caregiver? They asked a few safety questions (the 5 rights of med administration insulin delegation etc.) After this they asked me what I knew about the surgery program  what types of areas there are (eg. ortho GI urology trauma...) typical acuity type of staff (RN to LPN to NA ratio)  and which would I prefer to work in.  After this they asked if I had any questions. Once this was finished I was given a security clearance check form reference check form and basic information (S.I.N. contact info emergency contact) form to fill out. When I finished these forms I returned them to the Admin assistant and went back home. Three weeks later I was informed that Orientation was being held on Monday (it was Friday when they phoned)  The whole process didn't seem very organized. The interview was average. My suggestion is to dress professionally (a student before me was dressed in jeans and a hoodie. She didn't get the job) ask questions research the unit a little bit and be friendly and confident. The surgical units are quite fast paced and the patients can be quite heavy to look after. Most of the nurses have a lot of seniority (20 years) so you'll be the junior for a very long time. The senior nurses are not very flexible in their thinking and you will have to change how you do some things in order to fit into the team.,0.9636872,0.036056664,0.00025622998

"Applied online on Indeed  Was called within a wk by the female who would be interviewing.  She was extremely aggressive and rude on the phone (didn't even mention the role) and expected because she chose when to call me that I would be available and know the exact job description/details even though I did not have a computer in front of me nor did I remember applying to the organization/job (as of course as an applicant you don't just apply to 1 job these days).  BGC of Niagara seemed from the question on the phone that they hold bias and discriminate against people's location as the tone and questions reflected my current location compared to the work location (which obviously is a problem for them even though I have the right to apply to any position in my province and in Canada; what don't they get about that and why choose to show the culture is to discriminate against those not in your tribe/location? hmm...).  I set up a date/time to interview but when I asked for accommodations in the hiring process I  ""policy"" instead of a welcoming & friendly environment that expresses on their job descriptions that they create barrierfree opportunities for candidates and that they are accommodating.   using ""policy"" indicates that corporate America has ruined the grassroots/not for profit feel of what was the old B&GC of Canada.  After asking for accommodations in the hiring process  and being denied I still agreed to the interview.  After a very short time (in the same day) I was rudely called back and told I would not be asked to interview as they had moved on from my application.

Interviews were easy enough but the questions asked indicated that the interviewers did not really understand statisitcs or experimental design.   The skills test was kind of odd. It was a good idea they provided some data and asked you to write up your impressions of it. But the data set was poorly selected in that there wasn't much to be said about it. It was demographics on birth rate but there were no outliers or patterns that invited speculation or interpretation.  Again I'm not sure about the hiring managers' understanding of research.,0.028271098,0.9709119,0.0008170117

An HR representative scheduled a phone interview with me for a volunteer position. They did not call me during the agreed upon time. I sent a follow up email asking if the interview would take place but I never received a reply (it's been weeks).

"Their interview process is a complete waste of time.  First you will do a screener interview with an HR person who is not smart enough to actually understand what you are saying about the role.  This drone is just looking at a keywords sheet.  Second: They will give you the dumbest assessment test where you have 1 hr to just complete some meaningless tasks in Excel. Look for Red Cross Data Analyst Game on Youtube and you will find the video I made showing how to beat it.  Third: You will do a teams call with the useless HR person and the manager. This manager desperately tries to test you by asking incredibly dumb text book level questions.   The most annoying thing about this is I went through all these hoops and the role only  paid $63k a year. I already have a position that pays me over $10k more per year but I took the interview process just to see what it was going to be like. I never intended to accept the role.  But I didn't get the chance bc when they say ""we will be in touch next week"" that means you won't hear from the moron HR person bc she is too incompetent to know how to schedule a call in a calander.",0.998985,0.000846494,0.00016849425

I agreed to a time to meet with them the following week. During the first interview there were three people interviewing me two staff members and one person with exceptional needs. He was placed there to gauge my reaction to conversing with someone who had exceptional needs which was appropriate given that the nature of the job was developmental service work in a relief capacity. I answered the questions that they asked me and following that I was required to fill out a form provide references and complete a police background check. After I had completed these forms I was asked to send the completed forms to them and fortunately was asked to come back for a second interview which took place a couple weeks after the fact. At the second interview I was interviewed by different people one of which was the manager who eventually hired me to work for her at the group homes that they supervised. I answered several of the questions that they answered and then was asked to type out the answer to a few questions that were typed onto a piece of paper that they handed me. I completed the answers on that form  which were related to my prior experience to those with exceptional needs  and emailed the answer to those questions to the email address provided to me. After a week passed I was asked to come and visit one of the homes that Christian Horizons operated out of and after visiting that home was asked if I would like to work at that home. I said that i would like to and at that point I was offered a position though no written offer was provided to me until the following meeting.,0.0011786668,0.9984573,0.00036393295

For those on the job search I’d recommend using caution when applying to Diabetes Canada. I had an hour long conversation with their HR team as a screening interview and was enthusiastically scheduled for an hour long interview with the hiring managers. At that interview I was told I’d hear back either way (if I was a successful candidate or not) by a specific date. I hadn’t heard back by that date and so after a few days had passed I followed up. I never received a response. After over 2 weeks I sent another nudge and was told they reposted the role again as they couldn’t find anyone suitable in the first round of applications. A month later they resent me the same rejection out of the blue. A significant amount of time was put into both the interviews and the preparation beforehand.

I was greeted by a recruiter who explained they were running late. No problem I waited about 20 minutes which was okay. While I was waiting a man kept walking past me I thought it was strange that he avoided eye contact and didn’t offer a friendly hello. Usually in such a small lobby space someone would offer a hello anyway no big deal. The interview started with 2 recruiters who were very friendly they apologized that the Talent Acquisition Manager was running late. Anyway about 45 minutes in towards the very end of the interview the manager came in. It was the man from the lobby. He didn’t really apologize or offer any introduction or eye contact. He asked me 2 quick questions and then abruptly ended the interview. Such strange behaviour for a talent acquisition manager. Some really basic stuff in recruitment is being mindful of the candidate experience. Anyway I wasn’t offered the position but I remember thinking to myself I would never want to work for this guy.

I live longdistance in another city and they asked me to come in rather than a phone interview (they did not assist with travel expenses to interview in person).  Waited for 30 min in waiting room before they saw me. There were four people (human resources manager technologist department manager and physicist) and each took turns asking questions. It lasted about 40 min. My first impression as soon as I walked through the door was a negative one (the department manager looked completely bored) and I felt like they weren't serious as if they were only there because they had to be.  One month later I received a generic rejection letter by email acknowledging that they were very impressed with my skills and qualifications but I was not the successful candidate.

They called me about four months after I submitted the application asking to set a phone interview with me the next day.

The recruiter put me on the speaker phone and I could barely hear her and I had to repeatedly ask her to speak up.  I could hear her typing  what I was saying and she couldn't keep up and had to interrupt me many times. Moreover she clearly didn't have my resume in front of her because she kept asking me to spell the names of my previous employers spell the names of the applications projects etc. What annoyed me even more was that they advertised it as contract position but in fact that was not the case.,0.9987828,0.0010638996,0.00015320766

"Applied online had telephone prescreening interview followed by an inperson interview. They expect a lot of skills don't post the salary range they can pay which is superannoying. People were friendly and positive however I ended up feeling used. They knew my salary expectations based on my answer during the telephone screen invited me in for an inperson interview after that so I figured they were ok with my salary expectations. Turns out they just wanted to use me for a free consultation  after the first interview they explained the process for the 2nd interview that I'd receive a homework assignment and then have to defend it during the 2nd interview. I received the homework assignment but didn't receive a date/booking for the 2nd interview which is unusual and had me wondering. The homework  was ""tell us step by step what you would do..."" for basically what the main job was going to be. After submitting my homework I was told they were not moving my application forward with my application because they were looking for someone ""more junior"" (=cheaper).  It was then that I realized they'd had no intention of doing the 2nd interview all along they just wanted me to give them the stepbystep instructions they could give to someone ""more junior"" they'd hire at a lower salary.

The first being the online application which was pretty similar to most graduate school online application processes where they ask for previous experience why you want to join and how you would benefit Ivey (and vice versa). The second part of the interview process was the online questionsanswer session where you have roughly a minute to prepare an answer to a question and another couple minute to deliver it. The last part of the interview was the Skype/inperson interview. I opt'd for the in person interview. It was mainly behavioural questions and much of what you would expect from a graduate school interview style. That being said they are looking for individuals who understand their industry well and why they want to join the program. The key is to understanding how this program will benefit you.,0.00046316496,0.9990734,0.0004634031
Quite nice interviewers. Fast Turn around and timely response after every stage. Questions were very related to the role for the most part. Application process was easy as well.

It was quite amicable and it took about 50 minutes. Mostly just behavioral questions like why MBA? Why Ivey? Why now?

"One of the most interesting things about the interview process at Ivey was the fact that there actually were two admissions interviews. First interview was conducted by a member of an admissions team and another by a member of career services. I was told that the main purpose for the second interview is to determine how employable you are going to be at the end of the program and also to confirm that you have a clear career focus which is especially important for one year MBA programs. I think that it's a really good idea and it is unfortunate that there few other school that go through the same rigorous process to select their students. One thing that for example surprised me about Schulich MBA at the University of York Toronto was the fact that they've told right when I met them as long as I have the 660 GMAT I'm in no interview no nothing... that's good and not so good at the same time. It guarantees you entry but doesn't provide any assurance that the caliber of your MBA classmates is going to be up to any standards. They might have been able to wing the GMAT but they have a limited practical experience and lack of communication skills for example...  Both interviews at Ivey were over the phone and the first interview was with a Manager of Admissions. Since I was provided with her name ahead of time I was able to do a bit of research and find out that the lady actually taught some undergrad courses at the university level and was in her late 20s. Based on that information I put together couple of relevant questions that tied together her experiences teaching undergrad business courses as well as the MBA program. During the interview she asked me the usual questions about the resume and my essays. It felt like she spent some time reading through my background and had a pretty good handle on it. One of the most interesting questions that was addressed to me was modeled after the approach that the school is using to ""cold call"" students in class when talking about different challenging situation. In this particular case I was asked what are some of the biggest challenges that the industry I'm working in is facing and possible ways those could be addressed. This question makes sure that you can really think on your feet. I found that I had to stall the conversation for couple of seconds to summarize the answer in my head before presenting it and the interviewer approved of my approach saying that it's OK to think about it for couple of seconds. Overall interview went well and it lasted exactly 30 minutes. I found it was very well structured with excellent and honest answers to the questions that I had in return: for example I've asked the interviewer why she did not go through the program herself and her answer was that the Undergraduate HBA program at University of Western was fairly similarly structured to the old MBA program and that it did not make that much sense at the time :)  My second interview with a member of career services took place 34 days after the first one. This one felt more like a job interview based on the shortterm career goals that I've outlined in my admissions essay. It was a lot of questions like: What were the main reasons you moved from this position to that what were the main skills that you've learned in that particular job that you think would be most applicable to the field that you've chosen to pursue upon the graduation from the MBA program. I would say it was the easier of the two interviews. The interview lasted 30 min and included a question period during which I clarified the finer points about the differences in early placement between the students that are graduating from the last intake of the two year Ivey MBA program and the ones graduating from the first intake of the new one year Ivey MBA program. Again I was given excellent concise answers. And was told to expect the final decision within next 34 weeks.",0.0055375556,0.9822343,0.0122281425

I found out today that yes indeed she did hire someone from her Former workplace. I didn’t even get an email saying that my application was successful! I found out through LinkedIn.

Initially contacted for interview via email. Confirmed by phone. Panel consisted of 7 people for a low level management position. Had the impression that most had little or nothing to do with the position or responsibilities at hand. Subordinates also on panel. Routine questions lackluster atmosphere main hirer seemed rushed humourless out of his depth. Toward the end a few jokes on my  behalf seemed to lighten the mood. Interview last 45 minutes. Accepted the position after an initial lowball offer ($20 000 than the highest paid staff that I would be reporting to me!).  No orientation given just some photocopies of benefits plan. No probation updates and nothing acknowledged at the 9 month mark. Overall impression is one of poor HR policies and procedures extremely unprofessional culture out dated position responsibilities irregular 8 year gaps between performance reviews disorganized,0.99864966,0.0012040506,0.00014635222

I try to stray the topic by stating my  previous experience and how I have done also said every company have a different enternal process and I quickly adp to changes. base on the reason he did not offer me the job I find it discripnation on his part to want to base it those term there is laws against that and when I explained it he feel otherwise,0.0026307725,0.99702626,0.00034296364

Was a pleasant call.  2)  secondround video interview with 3 person panel. asked quite odd questions like what is my origin story.  As someone with 10 years of recruitment experience the second round interview questions felt irrelevant to the job requirements and strange.  It felt like they were trying too hard to mimic big tech companies.  I just find it funny that this role was part of their HR division with the aim to consult startups on their hiring and HR functions.  All interviews are a performance to some degree but the type of questions made me feel like some tapdancing circus animal. It'd been nice to be treated as an adult and professional rather than needing to do jazz hands.  I was declined from the role which ultimately was for the best for me  so who knows maybe these questions weed out people who aren't a ""cultural"" fit.",0.8644952,0.13454454,0.00096019485

"I had first applied in March.  I received an email confirmation of my application almost immediately after submitting on their application portal.    Within this email confirmation I was:   Informed that ""Whilst we normally schedule any contact with you in advance we may call you without prior notice. We only call from a telephone number originating in Canada and we do not use automated dialling or robo calling systems.""  an update should be expected within 10 business days I didn't hear anything back until 2 months later when I received another email.    This second email entailed:   “We are excited to advise you that you are within the top 9 out of 140 applicants that we would like to move forward onto the next step of our recruitment process a phone screen.”  “We invite you to provide your availability based WITHIN the attached schedule by indicating the time(s) and day(s) that you would be available for a Zoom call lasting about 20 minutes.” There was a link at the bottom of this email that went to another site where one can enter their availability within calendar blocks.  I was not coldcalled by phone as the first email mentioned may happen. After confirming the time I would be available for a zoom call I received a third email with a calendar invite and Zoom link for the earliest time slot I had requested.    On the day of the Zoom screening a few minutes into what should have been the screening I received an email stating that they would be late but are not longer than 10 minutes behind.  After roughly that long the screening call commenced.  This consisted of fairly standard rapidfire screening questions that the interviewer was entering into a sort of survey (which is also where they were selecting the questions from).  They ranged from the normal screening questions answered initially in your application (e.g. Are you legally entitled to work in Canada?) to questions about your interest in the topic of the job.  I was also asked a personalitygauging question: “How many golf balls can you fit inside a school bus?”   I was asked if I was interviewing with any other companies at this time which companies they were and at what point in the interview process I was with them as the interviewer explained that they were interested in moving forward with the applicants most committed to vying for this job.   I was told this time that I was in the top 4 of 191 applicants.  I was informed that the interview could run a bit longer since it was running late but that we would need to pause around the time that the interview was originally scheduled to end so that they could email the next interviewee that they were going to be running late for their interview.  Within this screening interview I was asked if I was interested in having an interview with the hiring manager which I said yes and a date and time was offered to me that was agreeable.  I was sent a confirmation email with the calendar invite for the date and time agreed upon.  The interview was rescheduled later via email as the hiring manger was out of office on the original date.  This was another Zoom interview scheduled to last about 45 minutes.  This interview was similar with some of the questions from the first screening interview repeated at first before delving into more questions about my background and fit to the role.  This was also done as a sort of surveylike format with the interviewer selecting questions to ask and then typing in notes about my answers to the form.  In both the screening interview and the hiringmanager interview I was given the opportunity to ask lots of questions.  Within the screening interview most of the answers to my questions were along the lines of “the hiring manager would know more about that than me” so I opted to ask the majority of my questions during the hiring manager interview.  I was informed that I would be told of further steps at the beginning of the next week.    I did not hear from them from that point until the next month when I received an email informing me that they had selected someone else for the role.  This email noted “From an initial pool of over 200 applicants […]” (in contrast to the initial 140 that grew to 191 over the course of the process). In total the process took about 3 months and seemed to have a massive number of applicants that continued to grow over the course of the interview process.  The interviewers were both very nice to speak with but the lack of communication during the interview process made it difficult as an applicant to gauge whether or not the lack of contact was an outright ghosting or if it was just due to a slow process.",0.009135774,0.9905618,0.0003023563

I received an email reply for a telephone screening interview.  I tried to set up a time with their automatic meeting tool but it was not working. So I emailed the hiring manager to ask for a date and time.   The hiring manager suggested a date.  After I confirmed and inquired for a time I did not hear back. I followed up three times throughout the weeks. I did not hear back so I gave up.  A few days later I received an automated email  thanking me for the telephone interview and it was a pleasure to speak but they weren't selecting me. Unfortunately I did not have an phone interview I did not speak with anyone or receive a reply.  It seems as though they are having internal issues with their HR hiring processes.

The phone interview was easy and after I was invited for an in person interview for a final round. There were standard questions about my current role and responsibilities. The interview went a little downhill when I was explaining my international experience. For whatever reason they assumed I lived in Canada my whole life and purposely went abroad to gain experience  perhaps it was my lack of foreign accent. So when I explained I went home for an internship it threw them off and they asked if I was legally allowed to work in Canada. Cue my life story about being born in Canada but grew up overseas. At the end of the interview they wanted to confirm again that I was legally allowed to work in Canada which made no sense to me. Maybe I should have brought my Canadian birth certificate along to the interview? At the time of the interview I had also been employed with another large Canadian employer for 1.5 years. This part of the interview threw me off because I'm not sure why there were assumptions in the first place and a lack of trust in my responses.,0.9956285,0.0041993465,0.0001722235
I heard back a week after the deadline to apply for the role. I had an initial 20 minute screening video call with the Hiring Manager then two 30 minute video interviews with other members of the team that same week.  The whole process moved really quickly which I appreciated. Everyone I interacted with was very nice and supportive even though I didn’t receive an offer. They were also happy to answer the many questions I had and even offered to refer me for other positions!,0.0005405767,0.009609221,0.98985016
I applied online had a call with the hiring manager bypassing the HR screening call and then 2 panel interviews with the team. Overall the hiring and interview process was simple and relatively fast.

One week later I was contacted to come in for an interview with two managers. An hour long 45 minutes of questions from them and about 15 minutes left for me to ask questions.  A lot of questions about past experiences and how I overcame difficult situations.,0.9968784,0.002998929,0.00012260793
I had a phone interview with the Director and an associate. They asked general questions about my experience and invited me in for an inperson interview. This interview had most of their team present (~5 people). The questions were more typical interview type questions.,0.0043755807,0.99544513,0.00017924725
My first interview was a series of 5 automated questions delivered via prerecorded videos on a computer. I answered to a timelimited recording. My second interview was then carried out over a video call (could have been in person but I was not in Toronto) and they asked yet another series of questions to get to know me better. Very typical and characteristic interview questions.,0.99653083,0.0033296393,0.00013963746
Twophase: 1.) phone interview was done by an HR manager 2.) the second interview was with a panel of 3 people  with HR program director & enterprise partner. The panel interview was very straightforward and asked questions in relation to the job and work experience. Elaboration of skills on how entrepreneurial skills were utilized during the current position. Lessons from the current job that might be relevant to the position that I was applying. Asked why that position was interest as well.,0.000456715,0.98893666,0.010606579
Video interview followed by in person interview both interviews were casual and the manager/HR personal were very nice. However they do take a long time to give you a reply on your status.

I had a prescreening phone interview for 15 minutes and then was invited to an inperson interview that lasted 1 hour. The prescreen asked very basic questions: what do you know about MaRS? why did you apply for this job? etc. The inperson interview with the Manager and HR partner was more indepth and I was allotted 15 minutes  of the time to ask my own questions.,0.9932348,0.0065947,0.00017045064
I applied by email and received a reply about 2 weeks later. They asked to set up a phone interview that was about 15 minutes long. After the phone interview they planned on doing two inperson interviews with candidates who proceeded though I was not one of those. The interviewer was from their HR department and very friendly although she said she would contact all applicants regardless of whether or not they passed the first round of phone interviews but I did not hear from her again.,0.010070643,0.9895375,0.00039191605

First and second round interviews. Interviews were with a Senior HR manager and the person I'd be reporting to in the role. The interview process was pretty freeflowing. The impression I got was that they were looking for a fit in terms of personality and skills but most importantly for someone who could pick up on the key aspects of the job without too much direction. I didn't get the role but the senior HR person on the interview did agree to have a short follow up phone call with me to discuss why they chose someone else and areas where I could have provided better responses.,0.024239825,0.9752823,0.00047788056
Informal and great discussion. Interviewer laid the business and operating the key drivers of the division in a very articulate but accessible manner.

I was brought in on 2 separate occasions to discuss partnering with MaRS talent.  It was obvious the recruiter did not have an abundance of experience instead was working to 'text book' methods of recruitment.  I was very disappointed that there would not have been someone leading the daily recruitment activity that was more progressive and new age recruitment.  Half way through the interview it was evident to me the interviewer was trying to 'learn' on the job by asking me 'how I recruit' in detail.   Very disappointing.,0.9975061,0.002360875,0.00013303739
The application and interview processes differed a lot from the usual ones. Instead of cover letter an applicant might make a video a website or write a threepages essay on why he/she would like this position. The director contacted me very quickly for an interview and said it would be a behav/tech oneonone interview. It turned out to be a meeting of five applicants in the same room. For one hour we were supposed to work in a team coming up with our common vision on the program one of us was supposed to manage when chosen.,0.61168987,0.387829,0.00048112162
I was a massive fan of MaRS for years and made it a point to go to events hosted there and kept up with the ongoing development. I was of course pleased to get an interview and even more happy to get a second and a third.  The first interview was HR  Hiring Manager and was a very standard verification of my experience. The second interview was with the Hiring Manager and was about fit and vision. The third interview was a senior HR director (?). A friend of mine interviewed with this person a few months earlier and described them as tough but good.  Generally I felt I did well in all three rounds. So I was very surprised when all communication stopped. After not hearing for more than two weeks after the third interview I sent a follow up email. No response. I waited another week and placed a call left message. No response. I tried one more follow up email after a month. Nothing.  This experience has drastically diminished my respect and interest in MaRS.  Even worse I found out that a mentor of mine had the exact same experience more than a year later. And then met two more people who had a similar experience. Test all happened 20122014.  So if you interview for MaRS and they suddenly ghost you it's not you it's them.  As for MaRS HR and community relations I have some four letter words I'd like to share with you. But instead I will simply encourage you to change your practices.,0.16088594,0.8381105,0.0010034582

A screening phone interview followed by phone interview from the direct manager manager and a video call after that. It was an intern position so it's not too in depth but expect a few chats and the process to take a few weeks. I should mention I was in a different city and I had I been in the same city it is likely they would have suggested an inperson interview as well. Video call was the replacement for that.,0.000552295,0.9990772,0.00037047523
Was done by a recruitment firm that was outsourced to fill this leadership team role.  I had a phone interview with an associate from the recruiter firm who did not speak to me about the content of the role itself the specialty of communications or about the work and impact of the foundation.  Definitely was focused on ticking certain boxes including salary expectations number of previous direct reports size of budget managed etc.  I had prepared extensively to talk about the work itself in the programs and what I would see as important to lead the communications.  However the phone interview did not go into any depth beyond the 10 minute checking of those specific parameters that I had already answered in the application questions/form that had been required.  I believe I did not meet certain ticked boxes so I did not proceed.  Such a pity that they didn't ask deeper questions about my visions on management communications financial inclusion in Africa or the trends in private foundations today or other deeper things to assess my quality and fit for the role.,0.99716514,0.0026991365,0.00013579613

I was taken to a small room with two interviewers and one of them actually talked some initial introduction and  interview process which helped me to open up and be bold about my ideas.

"I applied online via email. I was contacted to schedule a phone interview the same week. The phone interview lasted about an hour and I was asked very technical and specific questions in regards to my resume and experience. During my phone interview I was asked to schedule an inperson interview for the following week and to bring a list references with me which I thought was a good sign.  The inperson interview seemed a bit archaic to me. The recruiter asked me a series of ""describe a time when...."" questions and recorded what I was saying on paper. After that I did an excel test in another room. The recruiter had told me the next step would be an interview with the person I would be reporting to and  she would get back to me by the end of the week. Friday came and I heard nothing. I waited for the following week to contact her but she didn't acknowledge my email. Finally she called me the next Friday to say that things had changed and they were still deciding and that she would get back to me the following week. Again the next week came and went and I still heard nothing. I once again had to contact the recruiter since I knew the office would be closed for the holidays but I never got a response. Finally a month after my inperson interview the recruiter contacted me to tell me that they would not move forward with my candidacy. Overall the interview process was very disorganized and it was frustrating to have been asked for references so early in the hiring process if they weren't going to use them.",0.9823377,0.017324638,0.00033755606

The first approach was a phone interview that started explaining the fact that although this was a  position of responsibilities the hour wage was quite low. Then we passed to general matters such as are you currently working how much time will you need to change jobs what do you know about McGill and the question of why do you want to work for McGill was posed twice. The second call was to set an interview with HR and the person leaving the job.  The interview with HR was quite long almost 1 hour. They pose a lot of questions including: what do you currently do explain your tasks what are your strong points what are your weakness give an example of how who'll you get a long with a difficult colleague what computer skills do you have. The same day they asked me to have an interview right away with the head of the department. Many of the questions already answered were repeated and some new added: why do you want to work for Mc Gill where do you see yourself in 5 years why leave your current job were you have been for x number of years. I got to question back both HR and the head of the department. I emphasized that the first reason to change jobs was to have a better balance between work and family. That seemed to be an issue with the interviewer who expected full availability beyond the regular working hours.

Standard behavioural questions with some technical questions asked. Group interview 2 HR and 1 Other; Nice people but they don't get back to you if your not successful.

Average interview process but hiring process was unlike any other I've experienced. Three to four HR staff involved when most companies would use one or two at the most. HR reference checks are outsourced to another company with barely english speaking reps so all my reference providers were highly irritated with the process. An initial job offer was made that was lower than my last position (despite Ornge being given salary info). When I asked for further consideration to be made regarding the base salary the offer was rescinded via email without any discussion whatsoever. I have probably dodged an employment bullet if this is typical of management behaviour.,0.99870217,0.0011639572,0.00013386714
Initial telephone interview.  Followed by inperson interview which began nearly 1/2 hour late.  Panel of two managers and HR.  Questions were easy but it was obvious that one of the interviewers was trying to stump me as he kept changing the questions after I had answered.  Initially not informed there would be a test following panel interview but it wasn't difficult just timeconsuming.  I felt they already had a candidate in mind and just went through this interview as a formality.,0.056116715,0.9430903,0.0007930759

The first interview was over the phone with an HR rep. When I was notified of the interview (Friday) I was told it would be taking place on Monday (a little hard to accommodate when you have a job... but I made it work because I was interested). I had what I thought to be a great discussion with a seemingly genuine representative. Questions were standard and it lasted about 45 minutes. I asked when I would hear back and she assured me regardless if my candidacy is pursued or not I would know by that Friday. I did not hear from her for 6 weeks despite me following up 34 times. Her response was the generic 'we are no longer considering your candidacy best of luck!'.

This inperson interview was about 1h long and had a portfolio review where I had to show my work and talk about my design choices etc.   After the first round interview if you were successful you are apparently supposed to have a second round of interviews with higher up staff including director or VP level.

"I applied for a position in August less than 24 hours after the job was posted on the Providence Health website. It stated that an MOA was needed to start ASAP.  It wasn't until October when I received an email requesting an interview so I agreed. The phone interview with an HR person was okay; the interviewer did not know very much about the job except what was on the job posting so he wasn't able to answer anything. However he asked me if I could meet the hiring managers in a week.  A week later my inperson interview went fine; the hiring manager and physician answered all of my questions and asked me preplanned interview questions off a sheet of paper. They didn't seem particularly enthusiastic but I figured what the heck it's a very busy hospital and they probably have a zillion things to do anyways. To finish the interview I was given a medical transcription test.  Two weeks later the HR person who conducted the phone interview emailed me asking for references; I supplied three from a previous company. He then responded saying he needed a reference from my current job. I responded back honestly that my current supervisor has a history of treating staff badly when she knows they are looking for another job and that if I did not get the position at St. Paul's Hospital then my relationship with my current supervisor would be jeopardized. He also asked me if I could start ASAP but I said I would need to give 2 weeks' notice.  The HR guy called me to ask ""Didn't you read the posting when it said we need somebody ASAP"" and in an accusatory tone he said ""You're obviously lying about your current boss and you're obviously hiding something.""  Yes they needed someone ASAP so bad they waited 23 months to call me for an interview and don't care about job applicants wanting to be professional and courteous to their current employers.  I told the HR guy again that I was not willing to burn the bridges with my current company by quitting without notice and that once again I did not want to risk the working relationship with my current boss so if he really wanted my current supervisor as a reference then withdraw my candidacy.  I never heard from HR again.  The disrespect that HR guy showed and him demanding I behave unprofessionally in my current job was not acceptable.

Interview was through zoom I interviewed with two people. Overall it felt more like a conversation at a coffee shop than an interview. Had lots of questions relating to telco terms and lots of behavioural questions.,0.0012770046,0.99852103,0.00020204521
Received an email first about the interview. It was a panel interview with Director Manager Senior Developer and another Senior Analyst. Received an offer after a month and a half.,0.0003178977,0.9989998,0.000682432
Overall process is almost a month & half  very slow unnecessarily but Interview process was a panel interview with 3 persons via zoom. Later on requested references  but I have to turn it down as they took such a long time and a follow up call.   I felt that they weren't that serious about hiring  after even following up with references they were taking so long  manager called me up after a week of following up with references ..saying they'll finalize the decision soon and I had to mention that I have been applying to multiple positions and giving interviews.   I didn't heard back from them and only after a month they sent me email. It's interesting that during this time they think candidates are sitting ideal and waiting for their response and then companies are curious about the career gaps as well.,0.9981933,0.001680923,0.00012575997

Interview consisted of Hiring Manager and multiple senior team members. A fake friendliness to the introductions and overall seemed unpleasant to interview with. Threw me off immensely and I left with zero interest hoping I heard back from them.,0.9989318,0.00090605,0.00016210442
HR scheduled interview with interviewers but forgot to notify me about the interview time. Recruiter told me to hop on zoom within 5 minutes. Interview process was average but I felt like the interviewers were not the one who read my resume since they want a person who knows AI. Nothing on my resume mentioned AIrelated stuff.,0.9951906,0.004663377,0.00014603806
"Round 1: 40minute oneonone phone call with someone from HR. They were very friendly and made the conversation relaxed. They effectively communicated the way PHSA's recruitment works and guided me through the next steps with transparency  I was very impressed.  Round 2: Onehour zoom call with the Project Manager I would be working with and a Director. They had about 20mins of questions prepared but the rest of the time was filled with my questions and some back and forth conversation. Communication on the next steps was again very clear.  Following the 2nd interview the HR team did a reference check then emailed me an offer.   I applied for a role that was labelled as ""temporary"" on the careers page. Any applications for roles labelled as temp go through the same HR team that I talked to  called Talent on Demand. The great part about this is they connect you to opportunities that might be a good fit for you. So when you have a conversation with the ToD team it's a very general interview and they'll use your answers to connect you to various temporary opportunities. In this way applying for one job is applying for all of them (all temp positions). The job that I was offered was not the same as the one that I applied for but it worked out great.  The recruitment process would likely look different if you apply for a role labelled as ""permanent"".",0.0046547465,0.19794926,0.79739606
I had 2 interviews the first preliminary went well talked about past experience and what the job was to deal with and locations. At the end of the first interview I was told they would like a second interview to which I agreed for following week.The next interview started quickly with introductions then a 30min test (I'll add some questions below) all while they were watching me on the video. After 15min I stated that the questions were hard and technically I could open up Google and give the correct answers but I'll continue without Google.After submitting the test we had a formal interview asking questions about CS1000 Survivable Remote Gateway systems Cisco programming and past experiences of Project Coordinator and Management.,0.0019636883,0.99746287,0.0005733339

I applied online through the internal job site. I was offered an interview after 1.5 weeks. The first interview was with 3 senior PMs and the second was with the team I would be working with.

No phone screening required. Contacted by email to schedule panel interview within 48 hours. Applied to a few positions. Received confirmation emails.  HR thanked my interest in a job I didn't apply for and asked me to attend a panel interview in under 48 hours. Email confirmations did not match jobs applied for in portal.  After accepting contacted HR with questions you'd have during a phone screening. They were not responded to.  Other reviews state HR does not have general information. Decided not to continue with interview for job I didn't apply for because there was no discussion of anything prior to scheduling a panel interview. Informed HR. No response to emails until day of interview.  You can get an interview for a job you didn't apply for if it's similar to what you actually applied for. They keep your information in the portal. This may not be explained to you because their thank you for your interest templates are used and sent to you to set up an interview. Other reviews state the same. Some find out during the interview that it's for a job different from what they applied to.  No salary information. HR scheduling panel interview without phone screening and being unable to answer questions regarding position and department prior to interview scheduled to occur in 48 hours soured the experience.  Could be miscommunication. But no one called or emailed to want to answer questions.,0.9988689,0.0009964351,0.00013464625

I usually don't write reviews but can honestly say that I had the worst interview experience for this role. The Recruiter reached out to me during work hours and constantly called my phone emailed etc. until I had to stop my work and respond. The interview was lastminute and 5 minutes before the interview I was spammed again even though it hadn't started yet.  They then mentioned that I would hear back within a week but it's been almost a month now and I haven't heard anything back.

Perhaps a bit biased on the whole process as I was referred by someone from the company. Really is an easy interview. They care more about the fit rather than your skills. Skill cap basically just involves knowing how to use Excel copy paste and data entry so it's good to mention your typing speed. Anything about 50 wpm and you should definitely mention it.,0.0052862773,0.99411136,0.00060236035

Group interview was moderated well and everyone had a chance to contribute to the conversation. After you would be interviewed individually. Group interviews can be overwhelming when there’s lots of people so if you’re usually shy and quiet be prepared to make yourself stand out and try to participate more than you usually would in a group setting.,0.0076280115,0.9908669,0.0015051309

Was not told it would be a group interview. Wasn’t told too much about the job process and was asked random questions and scenarios.

First there was a phone screening where you're just asked some very basic questions. THen there was a group interview where you reviewed basic things about NGOs. Then we each picked 3 letters from a bowl and you needed to create an NGO with a mission based off those 3 letters and present it to the group. Then you had a short oneonone interview which just asked about your work ethic personality how you would deal with people being rude to you etc. It was very easy and I think the majority of people who showed up to the interview got hired. Once you get hired though you aren't really hired. You're on probation for a week or two until you raise enough donations then you're actually hired and get the full 17 per hour. Most people don't make it past the first few weeks though. Unsurprisingly there is a very high turnover rate. A good job for students but difficult to make a career out of.,0.3037908,0.6936965,0.0025126894

The interview process was better than expected. It first started as a group interview in which the interviewers were dynamic friendly and encouraged people to interact with one another. They clearly let you know what the job is and then contact you further for training. Very accessible if it is the job for you. To not let fears get to you and to just relax and be yourself would be my tip. Most importantly don't try to brag or try to impress the interviewer by your previous achievements. They can see your CV already; what they want to see is how you interact and respond to the group questions.,0.005410254,0.40061447,0.59397525

Group interview more games than questions. Go outside to survey people to sample the job. Asked some questions after in a 1:1 setting. It seemed like everyone in the group was hired so the interview is more to explain the job than it is to learn about you specifically. There seems to be a high turn over rate,0.99730456,0.0025729774,0.00012241647
There was first a phone interview that was overall pleasant and the recruiter was easy going. I was then brought along to do a group interview which was over an hour and we had to solve a problem as a group. I was taken to another room for a quick solo interview with some of your traditional interview questions and some unexpected.  I did not get the job but the atmosphere seemed great. The recruiter for the inperson interview seemed a little awkward and unprepared but this just makes you feel more relaxed.,0.002316397,0.98545974,0.012223795

I applied online and went through an initial phone interview with basic questions on my skills personality and the organization.    I was then invited to a group interview with 2 team leaders in Toronto which was very informal with role playing group games and personality tests.  We even had a “dry test” of facetoface fundraising by interacting with people on the streets outside the office and trying to get answers to simple questions.

They had called me from their head office in Toronto (I'm from Vancouver) and offered me the interview after doing a phone interview with me. The woman on the phone was very pleasant and the phone interview was easy enough.  I was unaware that it was going to be a group interview and only found out when I arrived and other people were there. I have had better group interviews; the questions started off with asking each person about their recent job on their resume and then ended with what each person's favourite thing to do was and why. I had to sit through some weird answers. At some points for the questions that required a more thought out answer they were forgotten because of people's elongated answers that would change the question basically and make you forget it.  The night of the interview I received a phone call from Public Outreach in Vancouver but missed the call and called right back a few minutes later only to try to figure out which extension to call and leave a message at. I did this and the next day I got around 4 or 5 phone calls that ended within seconds before I could pick up. I left a message again and got no call back that day. The next day I got another call from a different number but missed the call. I called back and left a message. I got another phone call from a DIFFERENT number which again lasted about 2 seconds before they hung up. I called that number and FINALLY got a hold of the person who did my interview.  I was offered the job however I declined because the constant phone calling mishaps began to come off as extremely unorganized.,0.920871,0.07829324,0.0008357119

It's not really that hard to get an interview or even pass the interview. This company is almost always desperate for new employees as it is a very difficult job to keep.   Doing the basics such as reading up on the company would be helpful however.   The interview can be done oneonone or as a group interview. The company is not really that interested in qualifications or background. They lost the resume I passed onto one of their recruiters and the interviewer did not bother reading the one I brought along to my interview.        The interview is very informal. After the interviewer goes over the requirements for the job he/she will get you to make an impromptu fundraising pitch about a random object in the room or your favorite charity. I felt that this is where Public Outreach decides whom to hire.      Of the four people in my interview three passed.  After you get through a group interview you will be put on an evaluation period for 1  2 weeks. During this period you will need to demonstrate that you can reach fundraising targets or you will be fired. During this time you make close to minimum wage.   After you are done evaluation you will get hired on at full pay.      Of the three that passed the interview I was the only person to pass evaluation. This is where they actually screen people out.

"Ran into a street canvasser and asked her if I could do the job she was doing. She wrote down my #/name/email and gave me their details. I did a little research and I got the call within 3 days. I believe they interview everyone who does this (they ask the existing canvasser what their judgement is of you once I worked as a canvasser for a while they asked me many times what I thought of people I met looking for a job so be talkative and confident). Interviews are done usually at their college st office. Group interview of 4 people but each of us given a turn to answer so dont worry about having to be the loudest or anything. questions were standard such as ""how would you deal with a disgruntled customer"" and questions relating to your previous experience or school/volunteer experience. remember to always relate every question back to why youre the best for the job. took about 15 min because all four of us were answering questions. Mostly the interview is to decide which style of canvassing youre going to try out (youre probably 70% guaranteed an eval period) being mall street door to door or phone. If you prefer one of those try to aim your answers to fit your desired position. The interview is basically just to make sure you're not crazy.

Telephone over the phone with recruiter. Questions weren't that difficult but the overall experience was a waste of time because they clearly did not read my resume. Interviewer sounded bored and was clearly reading from their sheet. They want someone to do a million jobs but only want a dollar over minimum wage.

It was a panel with 5 people on Zoom each asked 2 questions (each questions had 4 parts to it). It was more like an interrogation than an interview not a very friendly bunch. Not a lot of time to ask questions at the end. The worse part was getting ghosted. They said they would follow up in a week. A month went by and still haven't head back despite following up after 2 weeks my emails were always ignored.

The interview was held two weeks later and consisted of a 4 person panel each person having a list of questions to ask but follow ups to my answers were collective. The interview was a mix of technical questions specific to the position questions specific to my background gained from my CV and commonplace workskills and personality discussions. Nothing was rushed  the interview was approx 75 min  and I could go back and answer something if I wanted to clarify. Definitely an interview to prepare for in terms of knowing exactly what the company is about technicalities regarding clinical trials and research but the rest was what one would expect in a managementtype interview.

Responded to Workoplis posting. Interview was scheduled. Interviewed with a group of people from various university departments and an external project manager. At the start of the interview the external project manager stated he did not feel this position was necessary which seemed strange. The other people interviewing asked relevant questions listened to my answers and would ask followup questions as they saw fit. Their answers to my questions were polite and well thought out. With the exception of the external project manager's statement the tone of the interview was professional and polite while not being not overly formal.  I was contacted two weeks later and told the other candidate got the job. The reasons were strange as they felt I was more of a testing person and not a QA person yet the job posting and questions were geared to the testing aspects of the position and QA was not mentioned once.  I suspect an internal candidate got the job and I was used as a filler candidate to make the recruitment process seem fair.,0.0027057466,0.99689865,0.00039567437

Interviews progressed quickly and everyone involved treated me well and with respect. I had initial questions about the total compensation that I’d asked HR early on (before the interviews) which they did not answer.

This was one of the WORST interviews I have ever had in a professional capacity. First off they had me waiting 30 mins after my interview was scheduled to start so the panel could eat their lunch. Second they were way to focused on a course finish date that had nothing to do with the position. They had a air of arrogance about them not realizing that some of us are still employed by other companies and this is our time we are giving up to interview I would hate to see how they treat actual employees.

Recruiter called me at a time when I said I was about to enter a meeting at my current workplace. I asked to reschedule it the following day and she agreed to call me in the afternoon... Following day came and she never called me at all. I made sure my afternoon was clear of any potential conflicts in order to ensure that I could talk to her whenever she called in the afternoon. I called and left a voicemail to followup and never received a call back regardless. SAIT recruiters please be mindful when calling your selected candidates as they are also BUSY individuals who cannot sometimes answer your interview questions when you INITIALLY call. It should also be common knowledge that you should also ensure you call the specific candidate back after agreeing to it rather than waste that person's time. I am rather disappointed by this phone interview and recruitment experience especially since I attended SAIT years ago. The education experience was great but I can't say the same for its managerial operations though after this experience. I was potentially looking forward to working and helping SAIT realize its mission and support for its students but it looks like my efforts skills and time will be best used elsewhere instead.,0.9921914,0.007515511,0.00029312048

I applied over two weeks before I received a call which was two days in advance of the scheduled interview. There were two people on the panel the manager and HR person. 3 days after my interview they asked if they could call my references and I had an offer after they received responses. Reference check is via email and is very detailed some of my references were unimpressed that they couldn't give verbal responses to questions typing took longer. They also require that they be able to reach 3 references so when it was summer and my references were not answering quickly I had to go back several jobs and ultimately had to give peer references because I ran out of supervisors to give them.  The big thing  when they gave me the offer they didn't tell me my hours were 40 hours per week. I (wrongly) assumed it was 35 hours per week (like most postsecondaries) and accepted my salary based on that assumption. I was not told office hours or the number of hours until after my contract was signed.,0.99822444,0.0016340975,0.00014154679

Then I was asked to return for an informal meeting with the Director whom I would be supporting.

The interviewer was quite unfriendly.  She seemed dissatisfied that I previously had a part time role and didn't understand that this was in the context of an 80120 work week during my degree program where I had multiple jobs and responsibilities at the same time. I worry they may be overlooking many qualified applicants. I was over qualified for the position. I was willing to speak to that but the interviewer so very obviously felt the opposite I was a bit thrown off. It seemed that there was a disconnect on both sides. There was a reoccurring theme where the interviewer did not understand my experience but seemed uninterested in hearing me talk about it and relate it to the role. This was a screening but there were several situation task action result applicable questions. Definitely prepare a bit for this interview. I would have declined a job offer if I had received one as I was able to secure a better position with another company.  I'm not sure why out of all the interviews I've done in my life this stands out as negatively. The interview made me feel like I wouldn't have enjoyed the role,0.99785584,0.0020118868,0.00013231233

I'll try and recall some of them here: 1) what can you bring and offer to our research group? 2) Why do you think our research group is the right place for you to be? 3) Discuss your experience as a researcher and outline your research program if you were given a research budget. 4) How do you plan on making your research relevant to policy circles and decisionmakers? 5) How does your doctoral research connect to what you want to do in our research group?",0.9401345,0.05966334,0.00020221966

This was with the Ontario (Canada) Central East Division.  The interviewer was so rude and unprofessional that I complained to the head of the organization.  It took two emails to get a reply which said:   1) The interviewer doesn’t think their behaviour was bad.   (So?  That doesn’t mean it wasn’t bad.  And I didn’t ask what they think I’m telling you what I think.)  2) We usually do interviews with a panel but this time there were too many applicants for that.    (That makes no sense.  You should always have a proper interviewing process and there is no excuse for rudeness in any recruiting process.)  3) We’re sorry and we’ll try to do better from now on.    (Not holding my breath for that one.)   Utterly clueless.  But perhaps not surprising given the scandals involving the organization worldwide.

The interview is 1 hour and it's boring and a waste of time. The interview I had with UHN was probably the worst interview I had in my career.

I had to answer a questionnaire during the application process then I got an email asking me for interview slots I would be available for. I was interviewed by a doctor. It was a simple process but it was a very difficult place to find in the hospitalI was late but she did take long with another interviewee so not really.  My issues are that the Dr acted as if I wasn't really qualified. I am. I was a perfect applicant as I had adjacent experience in a similar role for a major organization it just wasn't healthcare. It was almost like she was suspicious of my interest in healthcare. I have a communications degree we can work anywhere for communications roles it's not unusual.  My main issue is that I never heard back from them. I asked the doctor during the interview when I should expect to hear back and she said more than a few weeks then I asked the HR contact from the email two weeks later and she said once the Dr had made a decision. I basically waited for months and never heard back from them. I'm not sure if COVID had anything to do with the decision as I interviewed mid January but I'm very disappointed I never heard back. It's disgusting to not give interviewees the respect of letting them know if they weren't selected especially for such a major institution.,0.9977574,0.0020948795,0.00014769878

This was in the relatively newly funded research center. A panel interview of five. It was supposed to be less of a technical position and more of a data analyst one based on their job description. However their PI said that they wanted two persons in one (data engineer and data analyst). So instead of 'accessing a data lake' (as described in their ad) they discussed how to 'build a data lake' and instead of 'preferred experience in medical coding/adoption of standards'  as mentioned in their ad this became a solid requirement during the interview. Their Primary Investigator (PI) a relatively new scientist spent the whole time working on his laptop. I knew that he was not doing anything relevant to the interview itself as he was sitting right next to me. He almost never made any eye contact even when asking questions. I knew from the first minute that this cannot be good and I have little to no chance and I might as well leave but decided to give it my best shot anyway. Two of the panelists were positive but they probably had little say.

It took them approximately a month to call and schedule an interview. I was only given two days to prepare for the interview but I was a new grad so I still went for it.

They only asked 35 questions and throughout the whole process they were checking on their beeping smartwatches which was very distracting not very professional.,0.99869055,0.001165341,0.00014417531

I was called by HR for a position at Princess Margaret Hospital. The options for interview times were very flexible. I set up the appointment and arrived 10 minutes early. There wasn't anyone at the front desk and I waited for half an hour to actually be acknowledged.  When the manager finally arrived he informed me that we had to wait for one more person to join us. When the other person finally arrived I had been there for over an hour past my scheduled interview time. I already didn't want the job just based on how unorganized things were. I was asked 1 technical question the rest of the questions were just useless (eg: biggest weakness where you see yourself in 5 years). I ended up just cutting off the manager telling him I wasn't interested in the job. He asked why and told him the reason. I found it to be a waste of time and don't recommend.,0.99880576,0.0010440659,0.00015010001

I was recommended to UBC by a recruiter. First interview: average the panel asked relevant questions. Second interview: terrible.

Not only that he kept bashing me about my skill and experience and how I'm not good enough for his team. AND..he asked me to stay extra 15 min to talk to me. Just to be polite I said yes (I should have said no). He still kept talking about how great he is for this organization and the fact if he were to take me on it would be huge risk.

I applied online with my resume and cover letter. I heard back in 2 weeks that I am invited for a presentation interview in 23 weeks.

The reference check took a long time and I suspect that some references from my previous company gave a biased review about me or my other references. However it was a small company and half of their staff left within a year due to company problems.  I was surprised that hiring managers did NOT check my transcripts from UBC and my internal references from UBC (previously worked with UBC Professors). I was further disappointed when I received a generic rejection email from “DO NOT REPLY” address. I was at least expecting a thoughtful rejection email after a few months of patiently following up with them. It’s difficult to believe that UBC does not value their graduates and does not treat candidates well during the hiring process.,0.9979748,0.0018093025,0.00021592258

SUPER unprofessional slow outdated... I was interviewed for Communications Coordinator in the Equity & Inclusion Dept. (applied in Jan and didn't get called til April...) The team here including the manager give very awkward vibes  although I felt the first interview went well on my part I left with a strange feeling. They emailed me for a second Interview so I went all the way there for another interview with some higherups. This one felt a bit better but still they were late and unorganized. Then they emailed me a few days later asking for references. Ok.. so they called both references who said that the conversations went really well. Then I heard nothing for a week so I followed up with an email. Nothing. They completely GHOSTED me.. and now it's been almost 2 months and still nothing. Extremely unprofessional and rude. Especially after 2 inperson interviews an assignment reference checks AND saying they would contact me. After seeing the office and the way I felt in the interviews I am glad they never offered me the position because I feel like I dodged working in a shitshow environment!,0.989588,0.010210832,0.00020109232

I first received an email to set up a phone interview. They were very accommodating and flexible and even asked me to suggest a couple of times that would best suit me. I found the interview a bit tough over the phone because there were two people asking questions and I'm much more comfortable face to face.

Then the manager will call you in one by one to give you the results.  It is pretty clear that some people don't stand out and they get the job anyways (they'll hire about 90% of all people).  For those that don't get hired it almost feels fake like they were paid to be there so it seems like not everyone gets the job but don't really know if that is really the case although many have said that is the case.,0.9916114,0.008271829,0.00011679156

Pretty typical for a faculty position. Gave a couple of talks did an interview with a search committee and with the associate Dean. In my case this interview predates the present University Culture which is stronger more ambitious and more selective.

"The interview was handled in a professional manner. Two people oversaw the interview. The questions were challenging enough that I needed to think about a few responses but not so overly challenging that I was stumped or stressed.

What was the issue and how did you resolve it?""",0.00072198024,0.99848974,0.0007881619
It was 2 round interview with 2 people each time. The atmosphere was more official than in other companies.

I had an over the phone interview with the PI. The position required the research assistant to spend a lot of time on the phone with participants so his logic was to see how I handled a phone conversation with him. He mostly asked questions about my past work experience what skills I had to offer how I have handled work related situations in the past and how I would handle hypothetical situations.,0.003129229,0.99669194,0.00017879272

There was no formal interview process. Basically you find a professor that is willing to take you on as a graduate student and then complete a form.

Guaranteed stipends are usually around 1921k depending on the Department.,0.00056257064,0.99834406,0.0010933666
Fairly straightforward typical process conducted by the boss and the person who was in the role at that time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Although you did have to do a decent amount of work on an assignment that was emailed in ahead of the interview.  Also when it came time to discuss salary and I told them my range but that it was negotiable depending on other benefits that seemed to completely through the interviewer off... It's a line I've used many times in the past which I believe conveys that if a company has 6 weeks of paid vacation or phenomenal health spending accounts or bonuses then you're more than willing to take that into account during the salary discussion. But she seemed put off by it and asked what I meant by that and what kind of benefits I was referring to. Maybe because it's a union and everything is so set in stone that wasn't something she was used to thinking about but you can't expect that an interviewee is fully aware of the details of the contract without having seen it!,0.0848046,0.91481596,0.00037942623
I was selected for a facetoface interview and then called in for a second interview. Its been quite some time since that interview.

The interview was extremely short. All that happened was that the Director of the department watched how I interacted with her two front office staff  one a long time veteran of U of C and the other a second language speaker (though not to the extent that it made the slightest difference). The director then asked standard resumebased followups and we were done. The interview was perhaps15 minutes long.,0.42250606,0.57709366,0.000400273

The interview was casual and long. It's basically just a long very informal assessment of your personality and experience. Since it's an acting job and the manager there is an actor there is not a lot expected in terms of preparation or dress code. He is a really entertaining guy and besides a need to assess he seems to have a genuine interest in getting to know the people he will be working with. The work can be a little awkward and/or stressful at times and a good sense of humor with a professional attitude are important. Be prepared to be there for about 2 hours.

Individual faculty members tend to to unofficially interview candidates because of new hiring policies they have to post the position publicly but want to make sure there's going to be at least one keeper. This will vary greatly between individual positions due to the individual people operating on their own. The HR process is excruciatingly slow.

I was interviewed by three people. They all sat in comfortable chairs around a long table.

It was understood by all parties that even though you weren't guaranteed the job everyone could nonetheless be pleasant and encourage open cordial conversation. That was not the case at this interview. This was more of an ultramodern bureaucratic tone where the company obviously chose to project a cold and disengaged demeanour.

Although the University of Toronto apparently outsources headhunting to Trilogy Education for this position I still think it's important for them to be accountable for their vendors.  A recruiter reached out through LinkedIn asking me to setup some time with a different recruiter.   I setup a call on Wednesday at noon. The recruiter called me at 12:30 asking me to move it to Thursday at 2. I agreed.  He called back at 3:40 on Thursday asking me to move it to 5. While I understand being late _or_ rescheduling once being late _and_ rescheduling twice is very sad.  I didn't accept the rescheduling.

I was told to arrive 20 minutes before the interview and was handed a piece of paper that said I had to come up with a lesson plan for one of two options: one was present perfect one was conditionals for a certain group of students and a certain level of English. I was told to prepare for  a scenario so I wasn't expecting this exactly which is why I'm sharing this to give others a heads up! (Maybe this is normal in the industry; I'm new to it) The first part of the interview was explaining how I would teach that lesson; not a demo but explaining what you would do and why. Then they proceeded to questions. Some of the questions were quite wordy so I struggled to keep it straight what I was being asked (was also very nervous).

To distill this down...the candidates time is worth less than the interviewers  time.    I made the mistake of working for free in this case and tested my luck. I got burnt. Apparently they were ""impressed"" by my free work but I was not worthy of their precious interview time.   Waterloo University Marketing department owes me and the other candidates (including whoever was offered the job) a fair freelance hourly rate for the hours of work we put in.

"I was contacted through email for an inperson interview. Interviewed by a peer and the person I would be reporting to.

A panel interview with two of the ops team members. Their interview questions weren't great. For one they seemed really overly concerned about educational background/experience and didn't really seem receptive to candidates without a Research Analyst postgrad certificate which totally put a damper on the experience. I don't even know why they interviewed me in the first place given how put off they were by my choice of undergrad major. Just weird incredulous grilling me on my resume details. There weren't any real competencybased questions and they weren't easy to establish a rapport with.

"I applied through Indeed to a recruitment agency in which VHA is a client.  (For the sake of respect all names/affiliations will be kept anonymous.)  A few days later I was contacted by the agency to answer some screening questions and scheduled the first interview with VHA   I was informed that this would be the only interview and that the pay rate would be set by the recruitment agency.   The 1st interview was ~ 45 minutes long and was a walkthrough of my experience and answering some behavioural questions. I made sure to do my research and came armed with 10 questions of interest.    After the interview I followed up with the recruiter who later informed me that HR enjoyed the depth and thoughtfulness of my questions and wanted to hold a second interview for the same role but under a different portfolio.     I attended the second interview which was also 45 minutes and geared along with the same framework as the first. Afterwards I was told that I'd receive feedback from the recruiter in 12 business days.  On the second day I called the agency twice to get feedback and sent emails. A few minutes later they returned the call and after a few seconds of small talk I was informed that VHA didn't want to pursue my application at this time.  The excuse that was provided to the recruiter for my unsuccessful application was that I stated that I  ""assisted in tasks and duties in my experience and didn't take charge of my accomplishments"" which is hogwash.  Even though ""my experience and skills were valuable"" and ""my questions were clever""  I did not and could not honestly say that I managed certain aspects of former roles since I did not. While I did manage the operations of my portfolios I will not lie about former experience. Doing so would be dishonest.  I voiced my disappointment about being brought in for a second interview for the same role when the management team knew fullwell that this wasn't going to go anywhere. I don't think managers/HR professionals etc. even bother to think of the time money and effort invested into job hunting and dragging me in for a second interview when there was only supposed to be one is just cruel.  I am a fellow HR professional and to sleight ""one of your own"" in an already closeknit community is beyond shameful.  I should've paid greater attention to HR's body/verbal language towards the end of my interview. Saying things like ""all the best"" and ""thank you for your time"" is a kiss of death nonetheless patronizing when the team KNEW that I wasn't going to be hired from the end of the 1st interview. I realized that it was over when I saw the role reposted on Glassdoor yesterday.

I was called for an initial HR interview and was told that HR would be in touch by the end of the week to let me know about next round. I never heard back.

I completely understand if they do not reach out to all candidates if they do not make next round but then they should clarify that during the interview process.

The interview was moved up by a week because of a conflict I was flexible and rescheduled.

For a Director position that's an incredibly short time frame to assess candidates. The current director was the main person asking questions and she had clearly not even glanced at my resume and only asked generic questions. I kept waiting for her to get to something more more substantial. Knowing our time was limited I didn't elaborate much at the beginning thinking we'd get to my qualifications and my fit eventually. Before I knew it the interview was over in 15 minutes after more or less yes or no questions.

"As a recent graduate of OCAD University I was very excited to receive a call from Free The Children in regards to a fulltime graphic design position. Yes the salary was low but what can you expect from a human rights charity right? I place value in other things and I wanted to make a difference.   I did some research on Free The Children before interviewing and my first stop was at GlassDoor. I was quite surprised to see such mixed reviews. It's very obvious there are winners and losers within this organization. However I took it with a grain of salt and didn't let it discourage me.   I arrived on time for the interview and met with the lady interviewing me she seemed very friendly. We sat down and she expressed that the team was looking for a designer asap. She noted the team was impressed by my resume and liked my work. I was very candid during the interview expressing both my enthusiasm for the position as well as some of the concerns I had. I wanted to make sure I was going to be getting just as much out of the job as I was willing to put into it. She was aware of the GlassDoor reviews and she suggested we move upstairs to an office.   We went upstairs and soon another gentleman (who I believe was director of marketing) entered the room. She prefaced him by explaining we were having a very candid conversation about the position and my concerns. I explained the nature of my concerns while reassuring him of my interest in the position my desires to make a change and willingness to put in long hours. All of this however I believe only works within an environment that promotes mutual respect empathy collaboration and learning from mistakes.   He immediately became defensive and questioned by motivations for being there. He asked me ""are you here for an interview or are you here to criticize?"" I explained that I would not have biked across the city of Toronto to maliciously attack Free the Children. Again I reassured him of my motivations explaining that I was very enthusiastic about the possibilities that the position entailed but that I was hoping that they'd be able to address the concerns I was having.  That was basically as far as the interview went. The way they handled my concerns was very unprofessional. He was very defensive and evasive. The upstairs interview lasted about 57 minutes. The woman suggested that I ""give it some more thought to decide whether or not I wanted to continue with the interview process"" and to give her a phone call the next day.  It was a very weird and uncomfortable experience for me. I understand they experience a lot of turnover. I was very disappointed with the apparently lack of awareness or conflict resolution within the organization as well as their inability to face adversity and use the large amount of negative feedback that exists to make improvements. The interview experience seemed to confirm what many past and current employees are saying.   In conclusion my experience with Free the Children was very disappointing and not just on a micro level. There are many inconsistencies and hypocrisies within the organization that is supposed to be built on awareness empathy compassion and equality. What I experienced was more along the lines of naivety pride entitlement inefficiency power and corruption.   I genuinely hope Free the Children can resolve these internal problems so that they can more effectively focus on the real problem.",0.026929904,0.97217506,0.00089499616
I received a phone screen initially but I was leaving for a monthlong trip to Mexico in three days. The recruiter was gracious gave no guarantees of future employment but asked me to contact her when i returned to the country. A day before I was scheduled to return she reached out again to see if I was still available. We scheduled the first interview for the following week.  Four interviews in total but only because I originally applied for a different position (otherwise it would have been three). The recruiter identified that I was overqualified for the role I initially applied for but asked if I would be willing to apply for a different role that aligned perfectly with my skills and experience. I had two more interviews after that one that was very comfortable and enjoyable and one that was surprisingly difficult. The CEO was in the final interview and was extremely intimidating but very clearly on purpose to see if I could stay strong under pressure.

I did not find the questions or interview challenging although it was distracting when most of the individuals at the group interviews were on their cell phones checking emails and texting. I felt this was unprofessional. Also looking back I knew the salary I was offered was too low but I made a sacrifice believing that the work I would be doing was worthwhile  it wasn't.

To start off with HR was extremely unprofessional. I was given not even a 2 business day window to prepare or offered alternative days or times for the interview. The panel was nice but the hiring manager implied I was not qualified for the position all the way at the end of interview despite having seen my resume prior to the interview and choosing me themselves so it was a complete waste of time. They also threw in curveball questions that typically the candidate asks the hiring team which was very odd. HR was extremely unresponsiveness when I followed up at the 1week and 2week mark and the hiring managers didn't even respond to a thankyou email.

"I recently had the misfortune of interviewing for Digital Strategist position at World Vision Canada it was a oneway screening interview that was timed. It was one of the most frustrating and dehumanizing experiences I've had in my job search. Firstly the fact that the interview was timed made me feel like I was being rushed and not given enough time to properly articulate my thoughts and experiences. It's difficult to showcase your strengths and qualifications in a limited timeframe and it left me feeling like I didn't have a fair chance to present myself in the best light possible. Secondly the lack of human interaction was disheartening. I understand that companies use oneway screening interviews as a way to efficiently narrow down the candidate pool but it felt like a cold and impersonal way to evaluate job seekers. It was demoralizing to speak into a camera without any feedback or interaction from a real person. Lastly the entire experience felt like a test rather than a conversation. The questions were often generic and did not allow me to fully express myself or share the unique qualities and experiences that make me a strong candidate. It seemed like the company was more interested in ticking boxes than in truly getting to know me as a person. Overall I would not recommend a timed oneway screening interview. It's an inefficient and dehumanizing process that does not provide candidates with a fair chance to showcase their skills and personality. Of all organization and companies I would have expected World vision to have a more personalized and humancentered hiring practices. I wonder how World Vision HR department justifies one way interview with their core value that now sounds so insincere  ""We value people We regard all people as created and loved by God. We give priority to people before money structure and systems.""",0.99811494,0.0017061359,0.00017896175
"A head hunter recruited me for this role from LinkedIn. I'm pretty satisfied with my current job so I laid out what it would take for me to leave including salary expectations.  I had two interviews that were fairly in depth (an hour each) where I talked about my extensive experience answered tech questions and typical HR type questions.  One of the interviewers was very nice but the other woman was condascending and thought she knew more than I did despite me having a way more technical and intense workload at my current position.  In the end the head hunter got back to me (not world vision themselves despite them having all my info) to tell me that they didn't think I was ""up for"" the strategist level but would like to offer me another position (at a much lower salary than I requested).  Overall was a huge waste of my time and feel it was largely age based. I'm young to hold the position I do and world vision clearly thought I didn't have enough experience due to this.  It's clear they have no idea what they're doing in a digital marketing sense (using outdated CRMs mentioning technology that isn't used currently etc.)  Would not recommend pursuing an opportunity with them save your time.",0.9957171,0.0040645907,0.00021828186

"The hiring process was extremely disappointing. As someone who always looked up to World Vision as a worldrenowned charity I expected them to be more respectful and tactful during the candidate experience. First of all expect delayed responses in emails. I'm very mindful of the fact that everyone is busy   but when part of your job is keeping candidates up to date I thought it was quite disorganized to have such long response times.   Interview  I found some of the interview questions to be strange. It felt like they kept probing me to speak badly about past coworkers and bosses which I would never do. ""Name a time where you didn't get along with a manager"" ""Name a time where you didn't get along with another department"" (obviously they didn't ask that wordforword but it was along those lines).  After repeatedly saying I've only had good experiences (which is the truth) they kept probing and  it felt like they wanted me to speak negatively about past employers?? I also understand that these questions are to determine how a candidate reacts in hostile or unfavorable environments but it felt strange that they kept probing .  After the interview  If you weren't picked for the role don't expect the respect of an email or followup. They will ghost you. After working hard on their assignment and going through 2 rounds of interviews I expected the decency of at least a followup email. I reached out a week after submitting my assignment and never received a followup. So I contacted the recruiter and he never responded. It's very unfortunate because [I thought] World Vision was a dream company BUT if working for them is anything like the interview process (disorganized disrespectful) then I'm glad I dodged a bullet. I understand not having the time to respond to every candidate with a followup. But when a candidate directly reaches out and gets ignored it's completely disrespectful. Candidates are humans and deserve to be acknowledged even if it's a rejection. I'd recommend WV Canada to improve their HR processes because it completely turned me off to the organization as a whole.",0.99619734,0.003619736,0.00018294374

The process was ridiculous. A lot of waiting around for interview confirmations. The interview itself was conducted via telephone and Skype. Ended up being a waste of time as the interviewers had a lack of vision and couldn’t understand I’d be moving from another city to take the job.  While I am Christian and knew it was a Christian organization it was a little too “churchy” for me. Very Ned Flanders  all rules no spirituality. I keep work and my church life separate. Also very white environment. Not a place to be as a racialized Christian.,0.9984268,0.0014209118,0.00015230781

I applied to a job posting received a phone interview very soon after (very pleasant). I was advised during the phone interview that World Vision is a Christian organization (totally cool). I was invited to a facetoface interview with the hiring manager and another department manager (business unit manager). Quite frankly I'm uncertain as to why the business unit manager was even involved in the interview as she seemed very disinterested. At times I noticed she was fixing her hair and not really listening to my work related experience. She also seemed to think it was funny when I said that I wanted to be part of an organization that helps people. I was being honest with regards to what drove me to apply for the position in the first place. The hiring manager was great. It's just a shame the business unit manager who I would have little communication with was even involved in the process. I didn't hear back. However I found it disheartening to find out that 3 weeks later the job was reposted as if I wouldn't notice. I'm uncertain as to why they discriminate when their whole premiss is to help people.  I'm a single parent who was on the verge of losing everything. The least they could have done was be transparent. This has greatly changed my view of this company and has made me question their integrity.,0.8320637,0.16676845,0.0011678748

"I was contacted by a recruiter for a marketing position at World Vision which I will not get into specifics about. Following my interview with the recruiter I had a phone interview with HR. What I was very confused about was that she never asked me questions directly related to my skills but moreso whether or not I was comfortable working in a ""Christian"" environment. I was then invited to an inperson interview a few days later. Prior to the interview I was given a proofreading test which lasted 30 min. I made sure I checked everything before handing this in. After the test I was interviewed by HR and one of the marketing managers. I thought I did well considering I answered every question accordingly and even brought my portfolio along with cover letter to demonstrate my competency. A few days later I wanted to check on the status of my interview and when I contacted my recruiter she informed me I had not gotten the position as I did not pass the proofreading test. I was in shock. Coming from a journalistic background and being trained well in copywriting and editing I was floored. I called her and apparently they could not go into specifics but I had made a couple of mistakes not correcting a specific detail. How was I supposed to know this? Given the fact that I do not work for World Vision and have absolutely no training when it comes to this organization this was extremely off putting . Rather than looking at my educational background skills experience and the overall interview they chose to look at a couple of small errors and base their decision solely on this. I am glad I did not get the offer considering all the negative reviews I have seen on GlassDoor.",0.99686426,0.0029960535,0.00013966247

The first interview was over the phone they asked me more about how I felt this being a Christian organisation and that they performed morning prayers. Basically to find out if you are christian or not. That same day I got an email asking for a 1:1 interview. The interview was with HR and hiring manager. Overall the process was a normal situational interview but in several quiestions they asked non workrelated questions to evaluate fit.,0.08281448,0.91687304,0.00031247453
First I had a 15 min phone call followed by a 1.5 hour inperson interview with 2 people. The second interview included a quick test of logframes during the 1 hour discussion followed by a 30 min private test writing up an email based on a 3 page situation report (in a room where people constantly entered into so be prepared to be interupted). I was disappointingly asked in 7 different ways about religion/faith/prayers. While I expected it based on previous reviews I was really struck as to how it repeatedly came up and it felt much more important than my experience and skills. Afterwards I received absolutely no followup communication which was one of several displays of sorely absent HR procedures. I have experience with 2 reputable INGOs and have interviewed and hired staff many times. It is proper form to notify someone that you will not be moving forward following an interview and just discriminatory and illegal to ask anything about religion in Canada during a hiring process even once let alone 7 times. Whether one is fit or not for a position these practices make it perplexing as to how they hold a 'top employer' status in Canada .,0.99808997,0.0017600734,0.00014996598
"The interview process started with a phone call where they went out of their way to make sure I was aware that it was a Christian company. They asked questions in a very sneaky way that all but asked ""are you Christian?"". They made sure to tell me that praying was a part of the weekly schedule and that staff members are assigned to various devotionals.",0.5569667,0.4425894,0.00044390664

I was interviewed by phone a few months ago. The interview was quite short. The woman interviewing me first asked me for a brief description of my experience in which I briefly described my year of experience as a facetoface fundraiser representing world vision and how passionate I have become for the cause. I also spoke about how I had some supervisory experience as a leader in the campaign I was working on and how I had one of the highest success rates on my team for achieving sponsorship.   She then proceeded to ask me multiple questions about my religious beliefs and if I would be comfortable working in a Christian office. She did not outright ask if I was Christian but I understood what she was getting at. I didn't beat around the bush (like she was doing) I straight up told her that I myself am not Christian but that I share a lot of the same values as Christianity and that I have respect for the work that they do and the fact that it's motivated by Christian ideals. She then asked me multiple more questions about how comfortable I would be in a Christian office and how I would participate in their weekly mass etc.  I found this interview very unprofessional. The interviewer only asked me one or two superficial questions relating to my work experience and qualifications (I was highly qualified seeing as I've already represented World Vision for a year through a 3rd party fundraising organization) and after that all the questions were focused on religion. I strongly suspect that I was not contacted for a second interview due to my religious beliefs. I find this extremely disappointing as up until this point I have held World Vision in extremely high esteem. I will still continue to sponsor the little girl that I support through World Vision but I am very disappointed in the administrators. Not hiring based on religion is discrimination and it is illegal.,0.9806857,0.01904815,0.00026614993

I did not make it past the initial screening call as I am not a practicing Christian. They asked some questions about my work experience but the call ended when I informed them that I am not religious. They did not ask directly if I was Christian but rather asked me of my relationship to Jesus Christ.

A recruiter contacted me to interview for a marketing manager position but several weeks after the interview the recruiter was informed that I didn't have enough campaign management experience for the role. The recruiter asked me to craft an email outlining why I thought I would be a good fit for the position and sent it to World Vision. After a week or two HR invited me back to interview for another position within the marketing department but reporting to a different manager.   The interview went well and I met with two individuals I had previously spoken to in addition to the hiring manager. As I was leaving HR shook my hand and said 'I look forward to working with you if all goes well'. The next day they asked for my references which they called the following week. My recruiter emailed me to say that a job offer was being put together and being sent to the hiring manager for approval.   Four days went by and an offer never came. After another week HR contacted my recruiter with an explanation as to why no offer was made. Without getting into specifics one of the points outlined was a poorly phrased comment on my part taken out of context. I was disappointed that they could use my nervous statement against me when I had supported it with a great example of my work ethic and capabilities. The second point had more to do with misinformation on the part of my recruiter than it was a reflection of me. The third point was a scenario they either recalled or interpreted incorrectly and the fourth point was a completely false statement on their part. I have no idea how they came up with the last point and it boarders on slander. By no means did I ever say that and it's completely false! !!  I wrote an email to my recruiter in response providing my take on each point made. My goal wasn't to change anyone's mind but to clarify the inaccuracy of World Vision's comments especially the last one. I expect no apology but at least I was able to clarify things.    I can't say this is a bad organization because everyone I met was so sincerely nice however my experience was ultimately negative. I can't even say that I wouldn't recommend joining their team since it would be nice to work with such positive people and it's rated one of the most familyfriendly companies in the country.     I prayed a lot in the two weeks after the second interview and realized that sometimes the answer to prayer is closure.,0.87039524,0.12889811,0.0007066905
