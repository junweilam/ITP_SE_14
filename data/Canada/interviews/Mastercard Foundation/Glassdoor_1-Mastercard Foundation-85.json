I had a phone interview with an associate from the recruiter firm, who did not speak to me about the content of the role itself, the specialty of communications, or about the work and impact of the foundation.  Definitely was focused on ticking certain boxes including salary expectations, number of previous direct reports, size of budget managed, etc.  I had prepared extensively to talk about the work itself in the programs and what I would see as important to lead the communications.  However the phone interview did not go into any depth beyond the 10 minute checking of those specific parameters that I had already answered in the application questions/form that had been required.  I believe I did not meet certain ticked boxes so I did not proceed.  Such a pity that they didn't ask deeper questions about my visions on management, communications, financial inclusion in Africa, or the trends in private foundations today or other deeper things to assess my quality and fit for the role.", "Interview Questions": "How many direct reports did you have?
