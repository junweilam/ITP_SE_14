Yes, the salary was low, but what can you expect from a human rights charity, right? I place value in other things, and I wanted to make a difference. \r\n\r\nI did some research on Free The Children before interviewing, and my first stop was at GlassDoor. I was quite surprised to see such mixed reviews. It's very obvious there are winners and losers within this organization. However, I took it with a grain of salt, and didn't let it discourage me. \r\n\r\nI arrived on time for the interview, and met with the lady interviewing me, she seemed very friendly. We sat down, and she expressed that the team was looking for a designer asap. She noted the team was impressed by my resume, and liked my work. I was very candid during the interview, expressing both my enthusiasm for the position as well as some of the concerns I had. I wanted to make sure I was going to be getting just as much out of the job as I was willing to put into it. She was aware of the GlassDoor reviews, and she suggested we move upstairs to an office. \r\n\r\nWe went upstairs and soon another gentleman (who I believe was director of marketing) entered the room. She prefaced him by explaining we were having a very candid conversation about the position and my concerns. I explained the nature of my concerns, while reassuring him of my interest in the position, my desires to make a change, and willingness to put in long hours. All of this however, I believe, only works within an environment that promotes mutual respect, empathy, collaboration, and learning from mistakes. \r\n\r\nHe immediately became defensive, and questioned by motivations for being there. He asked me, \"are you here for an interview, or are you here to criticize?\" I explained that I would not have biked across the city of Toronto to maliciously attack Free the Children. Again, I reassured him of my motivations, explaining that I was very enthusiastic about the possibilities that the position entailed, but that I was hoping that they'd be able to address the concerns I was having.\r\n\r\nThat was basically as far as the interview went. The way they handled my concerns was very unprofessional. He was very defensive and evasive. The upstairs interview lasted about 5-7 minutes. The woman suggested that I \"give it some more thought to decide whether or not I wanted to continue with the interview process,\" and to give her a phone call the next day.\r\n\r\nIt was a very weird and uncomfortable experience for me. I understand they experience a lot of turnover. I was very disappointed with the apparently lack of awareness or conflict resolution within the organization, as well as their inability to face adversity and use the large amount of negative feedback that exists to make improvements. The interview experience seemed to confirm what many past and current employees are saying. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, my experience with Free the Children was very disappointing, and not just on a micro level. There are many inconsistencies and hypocrisies within the organization that is supposed to be built on awareness, empathy, compassion, and equality. What I experienced was more along the lines of naivety, pride, entitlement, inefficiency, power, and corruption. \r\n\r\nI genuinely hope Free the Children can resolve these internal problems so that they can more effectively focus on the real problem.", "Interview Questions": "Are you here for an interview, or are you here to criticize?"}], [{"date": "3 Jan 2017", "title": "Educator Outreach Manager Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at WE Charity (Toronto, ON) in Aug 2013", "Interview Descriptions": "I received a phone screen initially, but I was leaving for a month-long trip to Mexico in three days.
