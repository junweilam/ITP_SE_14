I agreed to a time to meet with them the following week. During the first interview, there were three people interviewing me, two staff members and one person with exceptional needs. He was placed there to gauge my reaction to conversing with someone who had exceptional needs, which was appropriate given that the nature of the job was developmental service work in a relief capacity. I answered the questions that they asked me, and following that I was required to fill out a form, provide references and complete a police background check. After I had completed these forms I was asked to send the completed forms to them, and fortunately was asked to come back for a second interview, which took place a couple weeks after the fact. At the second interview I was interviewed by different people, one of which was the manager who eventually hired me to work for her at the group homes that they supervised. I answered several of the questions that they answered, and then was asked to type out the answer to a few questions that were typed onto a piece of paper that they handed me. I completed the answers on that form - which were related to my prior experience to those with exceptional needs - and emailed the answer to those questions to the email address provided to me. After a week passed, I was asked to come and visit one of the homes that Christian Horizons operated out of, and after visiting that home was asked if I would like to work at that home. I said that i would like to, and at that point I was offered a position, though no written offer was provided to me until the following meeting.", "Interview Questions": "The most difficult question that I was asked was how I would go about aiding someone with exceptional needs in managing their finances."}, {"date": "6 Aug 2015", "title": "Direct Support Professional Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Christian Horizons (Toronto, ON) in Mar 2011", "Interview Descriptions": "Phone interview followed by 1:1 interview with scenario questions.
