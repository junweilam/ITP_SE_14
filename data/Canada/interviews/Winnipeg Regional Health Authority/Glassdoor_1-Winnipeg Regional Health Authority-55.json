I was told there would be a 30 minute test prior to the interview. When I asked what kind of information would be tested, once again I received a nasty answer \"I can't tell you that. Just be prepared\". I arrived at the interview and was given the test (a question to the effect  \"describe a time that you made full use of your public health skills\". I was then interviewed by two managers in Public Health. The interview went fine. They asked for my references. Afterwards I was sent an email from one of the managers requesting that I forward information about the FTEs of my last jobs. I forwarded this on. I found out that my references were never called and a week later, one of the managers left a message stating I was unsuccessful.  I think they had someone in mind for the job- I was overly qualified for the job (master's prepared) and have experience in public health. Overall, I felt the WRHA was very disrespectful.
