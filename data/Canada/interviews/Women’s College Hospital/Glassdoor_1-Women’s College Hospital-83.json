I was given not even a 2 business day window to prepare or offered alternative days or times for the interview. The panel was nice but the hiring manager implied I was not qualified for the position all the way at the end of interview despite having seen my resume prior to the interview and choosing me themselves so it was a complete waste of time. They also threw in curveball questions that typically the candidate asks the hiring team which was very odd. HR was extremely unresponsiveness when I followed up at the 1-week and 2-week mark and, the hiring managers didn't even respond to a thank-you email. Then finally after 3 weeks told me I didn't receive an offer through an automated no-response email with no feedback either.
