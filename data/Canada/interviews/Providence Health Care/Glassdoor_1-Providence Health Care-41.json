It stated that an MOA was needed to start ASAP.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until October when I received an e-mail requesting an interview, so I agreed. The phone interview with an HR person was okay; the interviewer did not know very much about the job except what was on the job posting so he wasn't able to answer anything. However, he asked me if I could meet the hiring managers in a week.\r\n\r\nA week later, my in-person interview went fine; the hiring manager and physician answered all of my questions and asked me pre-planned interview questions off a sheet of paper. They didn't seem particularly enthusiastic, but I figured what the heck it's a very busy hospital and they probably have a zillion things to do anyways. To finish the interview, I was given a medical transcription test.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later the HR person who conducted the phone interview emailed me asking for references; I supplied three from a previous company. He then responded saying he needed a reference from my current job. I responded back honestly that my current supervisor has a history of treating staff badly when she knows they are looking for another job, and that if I did not get the position at St. Paul's Hospital then my relationship with my current supervisor would be jeopardized. He also asked me if I could start ASAP, but I said I would need to give 2 weeks' notice.\r\n\r\nThe HR guy called me to ask \"Didn't you read the posting when it said we need somebody ASAP\" and in an accusatory tone, he said \"You're obviously lying about your current boss and you're obviously hiding something.\"\r\n\r\nYes, they needed someone ASAP so bad they waited 2-3 months to call me for an interview, and don't care about job applicants wanting to be professional and courteous to their current employers.\r\n\r\nI told the HR guy again that I was not willing to burn the bridges with my current company by quitting without notice and that once again, I did not want to risk the working relationship with my current boss, so if he really wanted my current supervisor as a reference then withdraw my candidacy.\r\n\r\nI never heard from HR again.\r\n\r\nThe disrespect that HR guy showed and him demanding I behave unprofessionally in my current job was not acceptable.
