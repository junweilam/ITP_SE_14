I wanted a career change. No luck? Maybe, but at this point I think it's extremely political to get in, I know someone who's working experience never was medical and got hired as manager... Consider also that AHS open positions internally and externally, I as an external candidate applied and send over 300+ resumes to AHS, and I swear to God I'm not lying, I even contacted the Unit managers directly from a directory access that I had and, hear this out, that's how I got my interviews, NO SINGLE INTERVIEW WAS FROM THE EXTERNAL WEBSITE, NONE!!!!! Also it's worth to mention that at the end of my practicum they offered me an interview, I was the last minute, last candidate, they asked me 5 questions, each question is scored and don't forget YOU ARE COMPETING AGAINST INTERNAL CANDIDATES WITH ALREADY MORE EXPERIENCE THAN YOU, if you say what they want to hear or score 4/5, more likely they'll ask you for references, then they send a whole document to your references where they score you out of 40 points and then they're supposed to make the decision to which candidate they'll go for, also each unit manager will ask you different questions some more difficult than others but at the end it leaves you wondering if you did well, you barely make a connection with the interviewer because they're not looking at you or your body language because they're writing down everything you say... So they call you and tell you that there are stronger candidates internally and that they made the decision to choose them... oh and wait... this is a MONTH AFTER you had the interview or even more! Some DON'T EVEN GET YOU BACK! I finished my practicum June 4th and it's exactly August 4th and I already gave up trying to get an opportunity to work with them. It's not to brag about it but it's their loss, happily I'm going back to a company I used to work at before because they did express and made it clear several times that they want me back, and they have offered me a position.
