I made sure to do my research and came armed with 10 questions of interest. \r\n\r\n After the interview, I followed up with the recruiter who later informed me that HR enjoyed the depth and thoughtfulness of my questions and wanted to hold a second interview for the same role, but under a different portfolio.   \r\n\r\nI attended the second interview which was also 45 minutes and geared along with the same framework as the first. Afterwards, I was told that I'd receive feedback from the recruiter in 1-2 business days.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, I called the agency twice to get feedback and sent e-mails. A few minutes later, they returned the call and after a few seconds of small talk, I was informed that VHA didn't want to pursue my application at this time.\r\n\r\nThe excuse that was provided to the recruiter for my unsuccessful application was that I stated that I  \"assisted in tasks and duties in my experience, and didn't take charge of my accomplishments\", which is hogwash.  Even though \"my experience and skills were valuable\" and \"my questions were clever\",  I did not and could not honestly say that I managed certain aspects of former roles since I did not. While I did manage the operations of my portfolios, I will not lie about former experience. Doing so would be dishonest.\r\n\r\nI voiced my disappointment about being brought in for a second interview for the same role when the management team knew full-well that this wasn't going to go anywhere. I don't think managers/HR professionals, etc. even bother to think of the time, money and effort invested into job hunting, and dragging me in for a second interview when there was only supposed to be one, is just cruel.  I am a fellow HR professional and to sleight \"one of your own\" in an already close-knit community is beyond shameful.\r\n\r\nI should've paid greater attention to HR's body/verbal language towards the end of my interview. Saying things like \"all the best\" and \"thank you for your time\" is a kiss of death, nonetheless patronizing, when the team KNEW that I wasn't going to be hired from the end of the 1st interview. I realized that it was over when I saw the role re-posted on Glassdoor yesterday.\r\n\r\nI won't recommend this company or the associated agency to anyone I know in the future.", "Interview Questions": "Could you outline your experience with recruitment?"}], [{"date": "2 May 2019", "title": "Legal Counsel Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at VHA Home HealthCare (Toronto, ON) in Apr 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "It was a long but fair process.\n\nFirst there was a phone call from HR, then there was an interview with two senior people.
