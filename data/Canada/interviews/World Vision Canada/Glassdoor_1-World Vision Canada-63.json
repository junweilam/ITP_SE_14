It was one of the most frustrating and dehumanizing experiences I've had in my job search. Firstly, the fact that the interview was timed made me feel like I was being rushed and not given enough time to properly articulate my thoughts and experiences. It's difficult to showcase your strengths and qualifications in a limited timeframe, and it left me feeling like I didn't have a fair chance to present myself in the best light possible. Secondly, the lack of human interaction was disheartening. I understand that companies use one-way screening interviews as a way to efficiently narrow down the candidate pool, but it felt like a cold and impersonal way to evaluate job seekers. It was demoralizing to speak into a camera without any feedback or interaction from a real person. Lastly, the entire experience felt like a test rather than a conversation. The questions were often generic and did not allow me to fully express myself or share the unique qualities and experiences that make me a strong candidate. It seemed like the company was more interested in ticking boxes than in truly getting to know me as a person. Overall, I would not recommend a timed one-way screening interview. It's an inefficient and dehumanizing process that does not provide candidates with a fair chance to showcase their skills and personality. Of all organization and companies I would have expected World vision to have a more personalized and human-centered hiring practices. I wonder how World Vision HR department justifies one way interview with their core value that now sounds so insincere - \"We value people We regard all people as created and loved by God.

As someone who always looked up to World Vision as a world-renowned charity, I expected them to be more respectful and tactful during the candidate experience. First of all, expect delayed responses in emails. I'm very mindful of the fact that everyone is busy  - but when part of your job is keeping candidates up to date, I thought it was quite disorganized to have such long response times. \r\n\r\nInterview - I found some of the interview questions to be strange. It felt like they kept probing me to speak badly about past co-workers and bosses, which I would never do. \"Name a time where you didn't get along with a manager\" \"Name a time where you didn't get along with another department\" (obviously they didn't ask that word-for-word, but it was along those lines).  After repeatedly saying I've only had good experiences (which is the truth), they kept probing and  it felt like they wanted me to speak negatively about past employers?? I also understand that these questions are to determine how a candidate reacts in hostile or unfavorable environments, but it felt strange that they kept probing .\r\n\r\nAfter the interview - If you weren't picked for the role, don't expect the respect of an email or follow-up. They will ghost you. After working hard on their assignment and going through 2 rounds of interviews, I expected the decency of at least a follow-up email. I reached out a week after submitting my assignment, and never received a follow-up. So I contacted the recruiter, and he never responded. It's very unfortunate because [I thought] World Vision was a dream company, BUT if working for them is anything like the interview process (disorganized, disrespectful), then I'm glad I dodged a bullet. I understand not having the time to respond to every candidate with a follow-up. But when a candidate directly reaches out and gets ignored, it's completely disrespectful. Candidates are humans and deserve to be acknowledged, even if it's a rejection.
