Many of the questions sounded like they were taken from a simple Google search (I.e. \"how would you define customer service?\"), I was not asked about St Michael's Hospital or its mission, vision, and values, I was not asked about why I wanted to work at St Michael's, I was not asked any knowledge-based or skills-based questions. Due to this, I believe I was invited for an interview as a formality, and not because I was a candidate, which is incredibly disrespectful. The manager would audibly and loudly sigh when I would begin to answer an interview question. The manager exhibited, I felt, borderline hostile body language and facial expressions. If this is how an interviewee is treated, I already know how the employees are treated and I will steer clear of that department for future job prospects. After the interview, I checked the Glass Door reviews and my suspicions were confirmed by a review on here from a technologist who had worked in that department, take a moment and read it if you can.", "Interview Questions": "How would you define \"customer service\"?"}, {"date": "15 Jun 2017", "title": "Research Assistant Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through college or university.\u00a0The process took 1+ week.\u00a0I interviewed at St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto, ON) in Feb 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "I came in for an interview with the Research Manager, the Study coordinator and the other RA.
