I received an email confirmation of my application almost immediately after submitting on their application portal.  \r\n\r\nWithin this email confirmation I was: \r\n- Informed that \"Whilst we normally schedule any contact with you in advance, we may call you without prior notice. We only call from a telephone number originating in Canada and we do not use automated dialling or robo calling systems.\"\r\n- an update should be expected within 10 business days\r\nI didn't hear anything back until 2 months later, when I received another email.  \r\n\r\nThis second email entailed: \r\n- \u201cWe are excited to advise you that you are within the top 9, out of 140 applicants that we would like to move forward onto the next step of our recruitment process, a phone screen.\u201d\r\n- \u201cWe invite you to provide your availability based WITHIN the attached schedule by indicating the time(s) and day(s) that you would be available for a Zoom call lasting about 20 minutes.\u201d\r\nThere was a link at the bottom of this email that went to another site where one can enter their availability within calendar blocks.  I was not cold-called by phone as the first email mentioned may happen. After confirming the time I would be available for a zoom call, I received a third email with a calendar invite and Zoom link for the earliest time slot I had requested.  \r\n\r\nOn the day of the Zoom screening, a few minutes into what should have been the screening I received an email stating that they would be late, but are not longer than 10 minutes behind.  After roughly that long, the screening call commenced.  This consisted of fairly standard, rapid-fire screening questions that the interviewer was entering into a sort of survey (which is also where they were selecting the questions from).  They ranged from the normal screening questions answered initially in your application (e.g. Are you legally entitled to work in Canada?) to questions about your interest in the topic of the job.  I was also asked a personality-gauging question: \u201cHow many golf balls can you fit inside a school bus?\u201d \r\n\r\nI was asked if I was interviewing with any other companies at this time, which companies they were, and at what point in the interview process I was with them, as the interviewer explained that they were interested in moving forward with the applicants most committed to vying for this job.   I was told this time that I was in the top 4 of 191 applicants.  I was informed that the interview could run a bit longer since it was running late, but that we would need to pause around the time that the interview was originally scheduled to end so that they could email the next interviewee that they were going to be running late for their interview.  Within this screening interview, I was asked if I was interested in having an interview with the hiring manager, which I said yes, and a date and time was offered to me that was agreeable.  I was sent a confirmation email with the calendar invite for the date and time agreed upon.  The interview was rescheduled later via email as the hiring manger was out of office on the original date.\r\n\r\nThis was another Zoom interview, scheduled to last about 45 minutes.  This interview was similar, with some of the questions from the first screening interview repeated at first, before delving into more questions about my background and fit to the role.  This was also done as a sort of survey-like format, with the interviewer selecting questions to ask, and then typing in notes about my answers to the form.  In both the screening interview and the hiring-manager interview, I was given the opportunity to ask lots of questions.  Within the screening interview, most of the answers to my questions were along the lines of \u201cthe hiring manager would know more about that than me,\u201d so I opted to ask the majority of my questions during the hiring manager interview.  I was informed that I would be told of further steps at the beginning of the next week.  \r\n\r\nI did not hear from them from that point until the next month, when I received an email informing me that they had selected someone else for the role.  This email noted \u201cFrom an initial pool of over 200 applicants [\u2026]\u201d (in contrast to the initial 140 that grew to 191 over the course of the process). In total, the process took about 3 months and seemed to have a massive number of applicants that continued to grow over the course of the interview process.  The interviewers were both very nice to speak with, but the lack of communication during the interview process made it difficult as an applicant to gauge whether or not the lack of contact was an outright ghosting or if it was just due to a slow process.", "Interview Questions": "How many golf balls can you fit inside a school bus?"}, {"date": "5 May 2021", "title": "Communications Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at MaRS Discovery District", "Interview Descriptions": "First you have to do a video interview with only a few seconds in between receiving the question and the answer, it's a recording you send of yourself and if you advance this round you are asked for an in person interview with 3 people from the company.", "Interview Questions": "How do you deal with a difficult or tough workload / tasks you are unsure about?"}, {"date": "30 Jan 2022", "title": "Coordinator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 5 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at MaRS Discovery District in May 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "They reached out about 10 days after the job posting closed, and I did the usual screening call with HR, followed by an interview with the person that would be my Manager, and two of my future team members.
