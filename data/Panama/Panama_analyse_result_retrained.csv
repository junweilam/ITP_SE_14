Having the opportunity to work at AIESEC is unmissable being part of a team of national directors and leading the network has made me grow in many professional and personal aspects. Flexibility innovative environment and growth opportunities are the words that define AIESEC,0.0010080771,0.0009788125,0.99801314

Complete freedom of work tremendously democratic. It really is purposedriven and is willing to change to meet it's purpose. Very highpaced and full of learning and growing opportunities,0.000560051,0.0005433406,0.9988966
Very low compensation and almost no benefits whatsoever which makes working here almost a charitable action. Because of the very high ambitions highpaced industry and environment and the low compensation it's hard to maintain a lifework balance.,0.99908435,0.00074651284,0.0001690894
Being an assistant at the MLC is great because you get to review previous coursework while teaching other students. Not only that it is a nice way to earn a extra moeny. Schedules were quite flexible for me.,0.00021641469,0.00033624555,0.9994473
It could be quite repetitive.,0.85543156,0.14422064,0.00034788117
The schedules were very reasonable and the library was not opened 24 hours a day so there was no graveyard shift. Also the Head Librarian Mr. Blackie is a very understanding patient and nice boss.,0.0012043009,0.0034568093,0.9953389
The size of the library is REALLY small there is barely any space for the books and tables and there is NO space for new books. It is frustrating because the FSU PanamaCanal administration limits the Head Librarian TOO much and doesn't provide the quality that one is paying or tuition.,0.9991155,0.0007079551,0.00017650316

Global Brigades is a great place to work it has a dynamic environment and it's truly culturally diverse.   Even if NonProfits aren't your thing it is a great place to learn and put in practice knowledge for the benefit of others and grow professionally.  It is an organisation that is growing fast and there are a lot of projects to get involved that make a sustainable impact in different countries.,0.00018379248,0.00028595715,0.9995303

Living abroad is an amazing opportunity. You have the opportunity to gain field work experience as well as office skills. With the transition to all chapter advisors to Nicaragua it can be a bit more office time but there is still ample opportunity to get out on brigades and in the field if you show interest and take initiative.   Meeting awesome local staff! Navigating a crosscultural workplace can be trying at times but it's a great challenge to take on. My Spanish skills definitely improved while incountry don't stop speaking Spanish (it's also a great résumé booster!)  There is a lot of opportunity to travel and explore the country you are living in. Work//life balance is great.   I met some of my best friends in GB. I'll always remember my time in Central America!,0.00026952085,0.0004667391,0.9992637
Some of the brigade coordinators are extremely unprofessional and hard to work with. Can be difficult to manage that and a million other things at once.   Programatic changes are extremely challenging to implement. Program Associates // Managers need to be invested and involved in making those changes especially to new GB disciplines.,0.9986035,0.00124484,0.00015166694
This organization has such a wide range of services that it wouldn´t be difficult to encounter at least one aspect that triggers your professional interest. GB truly provides opportunities to test professional and personal capacities do to its ample volunteercommunity development vision. No matter what role you are working on the expectation is that all coworkers be immersed (to some degree) with tasks such as managing budgets staff and resources client service development project management impact measurement supervision etc.,0.0030035523,0.012270958,0.98472553
The variety of roles is scarce as the organization constantly strives for low budgetlean operations. In some cases various tasks and roles are assigned to one employee in order to maintain low costs which can be overwhelming at times. Nevertheless this particular downside has provided incredible growth opportunities for those that were able to organize and balance the work load.,0.9187871,0.07887654,0.0023363305
One of the fewer organizations in Panama committed to support and develop an honest development efforts to increase rural poor communities access to opportunities for improvement. Cross cultural environment open to improvements and always concern about the positive impact in small communities.   Most of the Program Managers are professionals with genuine interest in rural development and providing opportunities for local employment.

The organization cannot find a direction and stick with it. Staff turn over is extremely high which makes productivity next to impossible. American management was very unprofessional  and put forth little effort to work with his incountry team. Company executives are far more concerned with the student experience rather than local communities that we were trying to impact.,0.9989728,0.00087791006,0.00014935141
