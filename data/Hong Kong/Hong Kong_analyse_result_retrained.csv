I graduated from City University more than two decades ago. This question should not be directed to me. For a person like me suffered a financial crisis like the one in 2008 it is all about business models those schools tried to maintain and make you believe in they are tiering and tying with appropriate counter part economies. They should have a macroeconomy to maintain this is their obligation. In a growth market it is more like “a micro local economies” run by “Jesus Company” or “a believed family company”. Sorry to use that type of religious secularized term. Therefore the question is the skill sets you acquire from the University or institution is enough preparing you to pursue a career in these types of changing economies or inefficient economies.,0.97488934,0.024846962,0.0002636721

DO NOT RECOMMEND UNIVERSITY FOR ANY POSTGRADUATE LEVEL STUDIES. LIST OF PROBLEMS FROM ADMISSION TO COURSES Admissions offer has no email notifications until almost deadline Admissions office unable to check for admission documents that they asked for Admissions in person unable to find documents when its an email and asking for us to apply for an extension when the email has been sent with proof. They unable to find yet pushed responsibility on student Entry to uni QR code having errors requiring more documents  Uni map not clear at all with all locations having too long names to be included and instead showing a number and letter which don't correspond to the building Uni only putting up signs one way which is not where students enter making us walk all the way to the other end before seeing any signs that help Course reg for masters have no waitlist when asked they tell us to keep refreshing and trying.  Course reg for prerequisite thats registered still comes up as error needing office to manually add Unable to swap courses only drop then add with risk of no space and losing course After following their advice to keep adding they banned student's add drop calling it misconduct but only because their system can't handle it Course reg unable to contact office as one office deals with all graduate studies from admissions documents to courses to awards and forms.  No reply to emails when asking about difficulties Broken links to the online enquiry form literally opening a page is broken message No contact replies from office when asking must go in person and line up behind others with other problems showing how unorganised they are Phone lines always being busy asking us to call again every 5 mins taking two days to finally go through this is for graduate and admissions offices. After allegedly opening add drop again the system is still locked for over 5 days and over the weekend with the only office response being they did all they could. Finally after 4 days they admit the system itself is broken and they will contact CSE because they cannot fix it.  Allows students to use broken system with lots of bugs and having no self awareness to reply to any of our pains. No reply when telling them about the broken links and bugs. Finally all offices and professors push their responsibilities when asked saying its another offices problem many times until offices are saying its each others responsibility. Almost always ends up being the SGS office's responsibility for everything. Overall Poorly managed postgraduate level studies management with staff admitting they focus more on undergrad as it has government support while postgraduates pay more than triple the university fees to cover while still receiving subpar support.,0.9990387,0.0008199013,0.00014153693

It is only suitable for people who look for routine and boring job and it is good for wasting your time. The workload is sometimes massive but learn nothing at all.  Some colleagues work very stupid and use the most stubborn way to work on a very simple piece of work. The culture in the company has already been default and no one would try to change it or no one would accept changes. It takes super long time and hierarchy to process a new idea. They are afraid to make mistakes so no one would improve. You must stick to the stupid rules if you want to survive here.  For the management most of them have worked in this university for over 10 years so they feel like only they have the right to say and do not listen to the subordinates' opinions and just instruct the juniors with their own ideas only. Usually they have nothing to do and just order the juniors to do their work and push all the blames on the junior.  If you still have hope and passion to your life do not waste a single minute here.

The university is spread out and buildings that are associated are not always next to each other. The PhD and research assistants for some departments are miles away from the actual department and within buildings students often had difficulty finding rooms. Additionally there seems to be a lack of coordination within and between departments as well as poor communication between administrative offices  and department offices especially with faculty who sometimes seem really far out of the loop with current best practices and policies.,0.9990765,0.00077559735,0.0001478794

Not so much the cons about working at the university but your experience as a research assistant would largely depend on who your supervisor is. If you meet a nice boss then congratulations!

Best reasons to work with the College of Business Information Systems Department is that you teach what's been assigned to you and grade assignments and help students out. If you can finish your work then you're basically free to learn new skills and network with academics from other departments,0.0003024988,0.000566468,0.999131
The downsides of working with the College of Business Information Systems Department at the city university of Hong Kong is that the over all climate is the pursuing of excellence through University rankings which is attained through publications in well regarded journals. This leaves academics with very little time other than to keep pushing out more papers which tend to be trivial at best.,0.99617237,0.0036022137,0.00022544067

Many cons:  HR policies are terrible terrible. especially leave policies. They are so bad that it interferes with the ability to do research. Its such a waste. They pay people a lot but dont allow them to do their research  Student quality is average and below average. English standards are appalling.   Offices are too small and uncomfortable. If you want high quality research I can guarantee you one thing  it wont come out of dingy offices!,0.9988254,0.0010103309,0.00016435698

The management focused on traditional journal impact factors thus developed indicators unfair to new and emerging disciplines. If you are working on an old discipline and published in IF >4 journals you will do well here. But if you aspires to establish yourself in a new area and published conferences books and new journals you will find little support here.  Also that the management seldom consults its faculties before deploying new policies. Most policies were discussed behind closed door and decreed university wide.,0.9967818,0.003075878,0.00014224256

1. For the department I worked for (Betting System and _________ under EDC_) there’s a lot of underlying politics but people who leave or are still here would like to sweep it under the rug just to stay out of the radar in order to continue to be paid. It is almost near to bullying in the office environment. For example one of the colleagues was told not to enter the test bed 1 month prior to her last day she was left outside the office and felt alienated. The reason? There are no seats for her and they needed to train new people which was fake because there were so many empty seats inside the test bed(lab where we worked).   2. Related to the above some got talked at the back and people would have rumours spreading out about a particular group or person. At times victims would overhear it and no one would stop the discussion. The emotional distress caused is very real.   3. Grey area for covid policies  Karaoke nights were held even people were told by HR that they should respect the club’s policy. Due to Covid there was this strict club policy to hope people would not catch it as easily while a lunch farewell was called off a karaoke night was held instead. This was obviously not to alarm the higher ups. The covid policy was blurry and it felt like only the people who sided with the bosses could get an extra benefit from it.   4. Fringe benefits but paid from your own pockets  at times the wider team would call for lunches and fruitgiving. Many of the times though it came from everyone’s pay not even funded by the team. What if people did not want to participate in getting a bubble team for tea? You would be an outcast in the system.   5. Agile ft. waterfall  the whole approach was so wrong. The project skills and approach was almost…legacyfeeling. No transparency and transfer of skills would be hard because people keep notes to themselves and take you for granted if you are skilful enough to figure it out.   6. Promotion is slow and not something to be looked out for if you do not belong to the small circle (related to point 1) of people. People have been leaving and even though reorg was told to happen soon if the bad practices stay it’s just not going to help with the big picture.,0.99860007,0.0012570501,0.00014289764

 Well known organization in Hong Kong (when you say that you work for HKJC people will tend to associate it positively: large organization race courses major events)   Some recent executives hires (smart / competent guys) are starting to voice what should be done. The problem is that some other people above them are not letting them executing in this direction.,0.013142193,0.98518294,0.0016748698
" Lack of company culture. The tagline ""One Club One team One Vision"" couldn't be more off the reality. Teams are siloed and tend to not want to work with each others. Basically some teams have developed fortress around them to protect their work knowledge and ultinatelly their job. As a result it's a pain to get people from different teams to work together. It's even sometimes impossible. Vision. Top managers do not articulate clearly and communicate HKJC's vision (if not that it is a world leader in horse racing). Basically one could feel like if the whole strategy was top secret and should only be known by the board of Stuart BoM and executives. In this context how do you want teams to be motivated and work together in the right direction? Also few to no offsite. Basically you spend all your time at the office which is a toxic situation. HKJC also celebrates individual performance (naming people during townhall) not teams.   Company organization. The Board of Stuart is all powerful. Surely these people are experienced and smart but i believe they are outdated and not in phase with the reality of things. They are also risk averse. Most execs know this but noone dare to say it. In a context of command and control you will be singled out and noone will support what you say. I believe the CEO is very capable but not empowed to do his job properly. In this context the company cannot work well you need to fix the foundation first before spending a massive amount of cash on other matters.   Failure is not allowed. KPIs are aligned with technical performance in a context where most systems are aging. As a result people are afraid of change (it could cause incidents) and protect their silo (my silo did its job look here is the signature that's must be someone else). How do you want improvement in such context? Failure is part of the learning process.   People are not valued. Dozens of very competent people are hired (in a way lured by what they sell you which is often different from the reality) and then leave within a year because they do not feel valued or find the working style too messy (""messy"" is a word used by hundred of people to define HKJC's working environment).  The building at Sha Tin racecource (SCTC) is big recent and modern however it quickly become a boring place. The rooftop area is massive but poorly utilized. There is no gym facility quicly accessible (you need at least 15 minutes to get to an old style gym room) and restaurant options are poor (the food in the building is not good / healthy).   People are not empowered. They treat people like dumb. A developer will spend a significant amount of her/his time in meetings and writing documentation instead of writing code. Staff are mostly scared to voice their opinion or suggest improvements. The reason being the command and control culture in place. HKJC also use a lot of vendors instead of relying on its internal staff to do the job. My take on this is that only vendor will stand HKJC's culture and thus do the job till the end (because they are paid to do it). They do not invest in their own people. Training are also poor.   Architectural decisions are poor. This is IT specific but given that their whole business is IT based any wrong decision made here will slow you down.   Products are too complex. Operations are too complex made of too many approval process (normal in a command and control culture). They should simplify operations and services / products. This is also the problem of monopolies who want every single feature instead of making economic choices. As a result your IT and whole company is in a pain to support so many services / products.   Creativity is absent. I haven't seen any creative solution while working there. It goes in pair with not empowring people fear of voicing opinion and command and control culture. As a example they are still developig solution like QR code. The mobile apps are also extremely poor.   Executives are too proud to listen. Smart internal staffs and consultants have advised HKJC on what they should be doing to improve but suggestions were constantly rejected. The ""open door policy"" is not representative of a behavior of listening to people. There are cases were the staff is threatened or being talked aggressively too because they voice their opinion.   Retaining people not competent enough. Many people have been working there for decades and life employment at HKJC is a concept that is still there. So HKJC keeps its people even if they are aggressive towards other people low performers putting hurdles into other people's way or else. If you are working there you will have to deal with these people and thus waste time.   Long working hours because of presenteeism quantity of meetings people not competent enough who need to be repeated multiple times what should be done. Working hours are defined such as 8:43 to 6:37 (where on earth do you see this anymore?).  At this point in time (2020) i would not suggest to work for their IT and Sustainability HR Marketing or other departments heavily administered. Wait at least a few years to see if their culture gets better. Risk department may be a better working environment. Regarding the Charities department i don't know.  Time is your most important asset always make best use of it.",0.9982337,0.0016129435,0.00015339573

The school doesn't care about your career you write your proposals and get grants but they don't give you enough lab space and resources to do your research yet they require a ton of research output which is ridiculous.   All they care about is your papers and grants and not your personal well being and career they want to input minimum resources and get the most of you.

The managers or above are incapable to give directions and guidance to fellow staff. The whole office is totally bureaucratic and full of office politics. No creativity is allowed but the only survival skill is to please the top management. Super high turn over rate not limited to program team but the actual whole office. The director is the key driving force for the high turn over rate as unreasonable tasks are always given within a super tight deadline and after the submission you will find all the effort wasted as the tasks are not going to executed but just to occupy your time. Besides humiliating words are often come out of top management's mouth. Staff often being humiliated in front of all the staff during the meeting.

A lot of freedom in work allowing to you make your own research subgoals and your own research approaches. But this is very different in different teams usually dependent on the leader's personal style. If you are luck to have a very openminded leader then your creativity will be inspired well. If you are unlucky to have some typical Hong Kong style professor as your team leader then usually they want you to work on what he / she has been working for 20 or 30 years because they reject to learn new things.,0.0019080933,0.99715185,0.0009399854
A lot of researchers tend to work along do not communicate. The evaluation of work and employment process is usually quite racial.

i have been with Hult for four years now and one of the main reasons i like working here are the entrepreneurial and international environment offered. You have the opportunity to try new ideas challenge yourself you do are the creator of your own success. Hult is extremely international: i have colleagues coming from all around the world and most of them speak at least three languages. Thus what i love is the fact that as part of my job i have been travelling everywhere getting to know different markets. You do have the chance to grow as long as you take initiatives and you are flexible I have been getting more and more responsibilities on a yearly basis moving forward in my career this is something that not many companies offer you in such a short time and i have been moved to our Hong Kong office after over three years in London and for me this was a great opportunity.,0.0008858469,0.0022302207,0.9968839

You are extremely empowered to do your job.  The work Seefar does is really inspiring.  Low levels of hierarchy and a pretty flat org structure. You can collaborate and talk with anyone in the organisation without barriers to get stuff done.  You are entitled to unlimited leave. No one abuses it. Management encourage you to take more leave.  Your work hours are flexible.  Recently introduced a pension benchmarked pay rates and home office support.  The team is extremely close for a remote workforce. Probably because we get together in person a lot and everyone is friendly and helps each other so much.  There doesn’t seem to be any hidden agendas or internecine warfare the best ideas almost always win. People are also really willing to be challenged and challenge each other to come to a good decision. This level of openness is really hard to find.  Management is really solid and often inspiring actually. Not many organisations could have done what Seefar has done in such a short space of time. There is also a clear focus on ppl and they are doing as much as they can given how fast we are growing. Kudos to them.  People are asked to leave if they aren’t a good fit either for values workstyle or performance. That doesn’t happen in many development organisations. It means our team keeps getting stronger is not weighed down by dead weight. But you are supported so almost everyone thrives. It is mainly arrogant people who don’t do well at Seefar at least that is my observation based on me thinking about this a lot.  Seefar seems to take things back to their roots before deciding on a new system. It is unlikely that something will get implemented just because someone ‘did it that way’ somewhere else. If there is a problem management are quick to act and get it fixed.  Genuinely the best job I’ve had.,0.11600067,0.7225908,0.16140853
Seefar has a high performing culture and management encourage continual feedback to everyone so we all get better faster. That is pretty unique and most people have not truly been in a culture like this before. A really powerful example for me was that at our last summit someone openly gave the CEO negative feedback and it was appreciated by him. The downside is that this can be tough to get used to for some people mainly those that are underperformers.  A lot is expected of you for your level so you need to be prepared to grow into your role and become effective pretty fast.  There is an environment of dedication so if you are not careful you will overwork yourself. While management have been conscious of this and have been encouraging us to not work so hard they have only just implemented systems to stop this which had made a big difference to everyone (in what other organisation do you need to do this?!). But it is easy to go down a rabbit hole exploring something and forget to finish work for the day!  Seefar is growing fast so org structures are fluid. However not a big problem.  Management don’t spend much time or money on promoting the Seefar.,0.8651806,0.13349159,0.0013278221

if you're a fresh graduate looking to enter an enterprise to learn how a reallife job works. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is definitely a great place to start and to build up your career goal. People are nice here and they are taught to follow the Church Standards.

it depends on what job position you have but there's a limitation to what you can learn from the IT side. It is a religious organization so it does not need an overcomplicated system or IT stuffs. The Church is run exactly like how a company runs so you can learn how an enterprise works.

I worked here as a postdoctoral fellow during 2016. I come from EU and I can confirm that all the other foreigners who work at my position in UST agree to these comments below:   The working condition is very poor! as a staff you still have to sit in a lab with a very limited space and the chair does not even have arm stand. The space behind the desk is so small that you often have to move others to be able to get out of the lab.    Some labs suffer immensely from tidiness problems and cleaning. It's very common to see cockroaches walking on the desk and dropping from the ceiling (I'm not joking!). University only cleans the floor of the lab ONCE every year!    The corridors are full of garbage and tools left behind by construction workers. This is not even temporary and they are there all year round. The obstruction would cause a disaster in case of a fire as people can't get out quickly. At night the  light is off in the corridors and many of the tools have sharp edges which can hurt people. University did nothing to fix the issue even after complaints.    The food at the university is overpriced and extremely poor quality. Even the more expensive Chinese restaurant in G/F has bugs in their vegetables. Most Chinese friends of mine don't eat the vegetables in their dish at all.   The administration is extremely incompetent. They can't even post a letter with tracking code. There is SF in the university but they don't even know about it or pretend to avoid it. Sadly the SF employee does not even have an office! he is sitting in the middle of the corridor outside all year round.   The university does not inform the new employees of any important information and practical details. There is no welcome package for new employees. You just have to magically figure everything by yourself or walk around and ask anyone you can find. Basically you go there with 0 information and you have to squeeze everyone to get some drop of information. A simple example is printing your business card which is possible but no information available as to how to do it. The website of the university is a total mess. It looks like every piece of it was paid to a different intern student to make. Absolute disaster of a website.    The toilets near the labs are a nightmare. Extremely dirty and people treat them so badly. It's the most disgusting experience of a daily life to go to toilet in this university. If you are faculty and sit in the other building then the toilets seems to be better but this is another major issue here. The faculty members are all sitting far away from the labs in an isolated place which has better care. University clearly has double standards in treating labs and faculty members.    The IT support is extremely poor in response and very inefficient. They take a very long time to process any request and sometimes simply ignore people. A simple card activation takes 3 days and they hesitate to give a temporary card just because it has some paper workload for them.    The computers in the labs are so outdated and poor that renders them totally useless in many cases. The IT support just doesn't bother to upgrade any computer unless they are really old. I don't know the exact policy about upgrading but it is very clear that the current policy is not working. We can't even compile a program on these computers due to their insanely poor CPU.    The transportation to this university is a total pain. There are only busses and no metro. The bus system has no arrival and departure time estimates ( as in app or website) and in rush hours there are not enough busses and often you end up wasting a lot of time in a queue.   Overall I chose this university because of their high ranking in the world but man this is one huge lie! Stay away from this university at all costs.,0.99894685,0.0008998181,0.00015335693

"Worked in 2 different units at the University during these years the workloads may vary which depending on the culture of belonged School/ Department/ Unit/ Centre.   For the workload I know that many employees are overload especially for the newly join employees. Meanwhile the salary increment and benefits are definitely unfair to them when comparing with Old Seafood. The problem of equal work for unequal pay is a very common and serious problem in the University.   Furthermore there are not too much professional development to administrative support staff. If you want to have a promotion you are better to ""jump"" and change your working places rather than stay at work and wait for several years.  The most critical issue for working here are the poor management particularly stick on Rule of Man management. This is a serious problem for some Faculty. The office politics and dynamics also catalysed low staff morale in the workplace and numerous unfairness to staff. The managerial level tends to ignore these problems. They don't know how to retain and treasure a staff and always think that can be easy to replace by others. They also don't know how to manage their office in a sustainable way.

The University of Hong Kong’s world ranking seems to be in the top 30 ahead of Tsinghua and Peking University. The overall academic atmosphere is also good and it is taught in English and the education model is relatively advanced. It has an international environment. I believe that if I can study at the University of Hong Kong I will get in touch there. The people and things we arrive are more challenging than those on the mainland and can train people. After graduation you should learn more than Tsinghua North. Some students study Chinese in Hong Kong. After graduation they feel better than those who study in the mainland regardless of their overall quality thinking and ability.
