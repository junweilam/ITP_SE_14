I come from EU and I can confirm that all the other foreigners who work at my position in UST agree to these comments below:\r\n\r\n- The working condition is very poor! as a staff you still have to sit in a lab with a very limited space and the chair does not even have arm stand. The space behind the desk is so small that you often have to move others to be able to get out of the lab. \r\n\r\n- Some labs suffer immensely from tidiness problems and cleaning. It's very common to see cockroaches walking on the desk and dropping from the ceiling (I'm not joking!). University only cleans the floor of the lab ONCE every year! \r\n\r\n- The corridors are full of garbage and tools left behind by construction workers. This is not even temporary and they are there all year round. The obstruction would cause a disaster in case of a fire as people can't get out quickly. At night the  light is off in the corridors and many of the tools have sharp edges which can hurt people. University did nothing to fix the issue even after complaints. \r\n\r\n- The food at the university is overpriced and extremely poor quality. Even the more expensive Chinese restaurant in G/F has bugs in their vegetables. Most Chinese friends of mine don't eat the vegetables in their dish at all.\r\n\r\n- The administration is extremely incompetent. They can't even post a letter with tracking code. There is SF in the university but they don't even know about it or pretend to avoid it. Sadly the SF employee does not even have an office! he is sitting in the middle of the corridor outside all year round.\r\n\r\n- The university does not inform the new employees of any important information and practical details. There is no welcome package for new employees. You just have to magically figure everything by yourself or walk around and ask anyone you can find. Basically, you go there with 0 information and you have to squeeze everyone to get some drop of information. A simple example is printing your business card which is possible but no information available as to how to do it. The website of the university is a total mess. It looks like every piece of it was paid to a different intern student to make. Absolute disaster of a website. \r\n\r\n- The toilets near the labs are a nightmare. Extremely dirty and people treat them so badly. It's the most disgusting experience of a daily life to go to toilet in this university. If you are faculty and sit in the other building then the toilets seems to be better but this is another major issue here. The faculty members are all sitting far away from the labs in an isolated place which has better care. University clearly has double standards in treating labs and faculty members. \r\n\r\n- The IT support is extremely poor in response and very inefficient. They take a very long time to process any request and sometimes simply ignore people. A simple card activation takes 3 days and they hesitate to give a temporary card just because it has some paper workload for them. \r\n\r\n- The computers in the labs are so outdated and poor that renders them totally useless in many cases. The IT support just doesn't bother to upgrade any computer unless they are really old. I don't know the exact policy about upgrading but it is very clear that the current policy is not working. We can't even compile a program on these computers due to their insanely poor CPU. \r\n\r\n- The transportation to this university is a total pain. There are only busses and no metro. The bus system has no arrival and departure time estimates ( as in app or website) and in rush hours there are not enough busses and often you end up wasting a lot of time in a queue. \r\n\r\nOverall I chose this university because of their high ranking in the world but man this is one huge lie!
