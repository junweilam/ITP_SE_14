For the department I worked for (Betting System and _________, under EDC_) there\u2019s a lot of underlying politics but people who leave or are still here would like to sweep it under the rug, just to stay out of the radar in order to continue to be paid. It is almost near to bullying in the office environment. For example, one of the colleagues was told not to enter the test bed 1 month+ prior to her last day, she was left outside the office and felt alienated. The reason? There are no seats for her and they needed to train new people, which was fake because there were so many empty seats inside the test bed(lab where we worked).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Related to the above, some got talked at the back and people would have rumours spreading out about a particular group or person. At times victims would overhear it and no one would stop the discussion. The emotional distress caused is very real.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Grey area for covid policies - Karaoke nights were held even people were told by HR that they should respect the club\u2019s policy. Due to Covid there was this strict club policy to hope people would not catch it as easily, while a lunch farewell was called off, a karaoke night was held instead. This was obviously not to alarm the higher ups. The covid policy was blurry and it felt like only the people who sided with the bosses could get an extra benefit from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Fringe benefits, but paid from your own pockets - at times the wider team would call for lunches and fruit-giving. Many of the times though it came from everyone\u2019s pay, not even funded by the team. What if people did not want to participate in getting a bubble team for tea? You would be an outcast in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Agile ft. waterfall - the whole approach was so wrong. The project skills and approach was almost\u2026legacy-feeling. No transparency and transfer of skills would be hard, because people keep notes to themselves and take you for granted if you are skilful enough to figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Promotion is slow and not something to be looked out for, if you do not belong to the small circle (related to point 1) of people. People have been leaving, and even though re-org was told to happen soon, if the bad practices stay, it\u2019s just not going to help with the big picture."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "AM", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work from home, 2.8 month bouns for good performance", "cons": "hierarchy, hierarchy, hierarchy\r\nAs a assistant manager, my ability is obviously higher than Assistant executive.

Basically, one could feel like if the whole strategy was top secret and should only be known by the board of Stuart, BoM and executives. In this context, how do you want teams to be motivated and work together in the right direction?\r\nAlso, few to no offsite. Basically, you spend all your time at the office which is a toxic situation. HKJC also celebrates individual performance (naming people during townhall), not teams.\r\n\r\n- Company organization.\r\nThe Board of Stuart is all powerful. Surely these people are experienced and smart but i believe they are outdated and not in phase with the reality of things. They are also risk averse. Most execs know this but noone dare to say it. In a context of command and control you will be singled out and noone will support what you say. I believe the CEO is very capable but not empowed to do his job properly. In this context, the company cannot work well, you need to fix the foundation first before spending a massive amount of cash on other matters.\r\n\r\n- Failure is not allowed. KPIs are aligned with technical performance in a context where most systems are aging. As a result people are afraid of change (it could cause incidents) and protect their silo (my silo did its job, look, here is the signature, that's must be someone else). How do you want improvement in such context? Failure is part of the learning process.\r\n\r\n- People are not valued.\r\nDozens of very competent people are hired (in a way lured by what they sell you which is often different from the reality) and then leave within a year because they do not feel valued or find the working style too messy (\"messy\" is a word used by hundred of people to define HKJC's working environment). \r\nThe building at Sha Tin racecource (SCTC) is big, recent and modern however it quickly become a boring place. The rooftop area is massive but poorly utilized. There is no gym facility quicly accessible (you need at least 15 minutes to get to an old style gym room) and restaurant options are poor (the food in the building is not good / healthy).\r\n\r\n- People are not empowered.\r\nThey treat people like dumb. A developer will spend a significant amount of her/his time in meetings and writing documentation instead of writing code.\r\nStaff are mostly scared to voice their opinion or suggest improvements. The reason being the command and control culture in place.\r\nHKJC also use a lot of vendors instead of relying on its internal staff to do the job. My take on this is that only vendor will stand HKJC's culture and thus do the job till the end (because they are paid to do it).\r\nThey do not invest in their own people. Training are also poor.\r\n\r\n- Architectural decisions are poor.\r\nThis is IT specific but given that their whole business is IT based any wrong decision made here will slow you down.\r\n\r\n- Products are too complex.\r\nOperations are too complex, made of too many approval process (normal in a command and control culture). They should simplify operations and services / products. This is also the problem of monopolies who want every single feature instead of making economic choices. As a result, your IT and whole company is in a pain to support so many services / products.\r\n\r\n- Creativity is absent.\r\nI haven't seen any creative solution while working there. It goes in pair with not empowring people, fear of voicing opinion and command and control culture. As a example, they are still developig solution like QR code. The mobile apps are also extremely poor.\r\n\r\n- Executives are too proud to listen.\r\nSmart internal staffs and consultants have advised HKJC on what they should be doing to improve but suggestions were constantly rejected. The \"open door policy\" is not representative of a behavior of listening to people. There are cases were the staff is threatened or being talked aggressively too because they voice their opinion.\r\n\r\n- Retaining people not competent enough. Many people have been working there for decades and life employment at HKJC is a concept that is still there. So HKJC keeps its people even if they are aggressive towards other people, low performers, putting hurdles into other people's way or else. If you are working there, you will have to deal with these people and thus waste time.\r\n\r\n- Long working hours because of presenteeism, quantity of meetings, people not competent enough who need to be repeated multiple times what should be done. Working hours are defined such as 8:43 to 6:37 (where on earth do you see this anymore?).\r\n\r\nAt this point in time (2020) i would not suggest to work for their IT and Sustainability, HR, Marketing or other departments heavily administered. Wait at least a few years to see if their culture gets better.\r\nRisk department may be a better working environment.\r\nRegarding the Charities department, i don't know.\r\n\r\nTime is your most important asset, always make best use of it."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "One of the top three in Hong Kong", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "12 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Senior Project Development Manager in Hong Kong", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The core business is horse racing (with the highest returns worldwide)  the proceeds of which are largely returned to the community and the Government in terms of projects, charitable donations and taxes.
