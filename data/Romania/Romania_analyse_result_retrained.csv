AIESEC offers the best practical experience for students. You not only get to develop the skills you will need in a future workplace but the community the conferences and the whole culture behind it will make your Uni years 10000 times better.   The great part about it is that you can be a part of various teams during your time in AIESEC such as sales marketing project coordination etc so you get an insight into what you can do in the future.   Last but not least you have the opportunity to travel and meet international students as the core of the NGO is international exchange.,0.00024284539,0.00032328765,0.9994338

The Staff has so many unresolved issues between themselves. They don't talk about the problem but they gossip about the problem. They all have issues amongst themselves. The Chief of Staff is unknowingly gossiper and defensive. She has no leadership and management skills very unprofessional.
