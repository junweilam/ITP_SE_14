They don't talk about the problem, but they gossip about the problem. They all have issues amongst themselves. The Chief of Staff is unknowingly gossiper and defensive. She has no leadership and management skills, very unprofessional. Instead of leading the Staff to normalise each other's differences, she is the one building a wall or barrier between them! She has the tendency to blame other person, cite other weaknesses infront of other people to make her look as the good one!"}]]
