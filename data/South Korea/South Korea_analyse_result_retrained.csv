 Senior Management is seriously out of touch with teaching department and has little to no interest in employee wellbeing.  despite policies to protect diversity and mental health etc the reality is far from that.  Director is petty and makes decisions based on personal and unprofessional bias.  ever decreasing package of benefits.  People with a nonacademic background making academic decisions.

BC Seoul is VERY well paid in the industry. There is huge amounts of overtime going and the base salary is very nice: up to 750 pounds sterling per month 2.3 million won local per month 830000 rent allowance per month medical insurance flights bonus and taxfree for the first two years. If you're not saving a thousand pounds a month there is something wrong. When you work it out it is like earning 50k in the UK.   Professionally you will teach on a huge range of courses thus giving you a beefy CV and coupled with the professional development (CELTYL / TYLEC DELTA PGCEi MA) you'll come out on top. You'll also get very good support from your colleagues  The centre has very good management these days who are responsive and understanding in most cases.  As of now (September 2011) there is a positive atmosphere in all three centres in and around Seoul and people seem to work well together.

Didn't pay properly and management chased me round in circles about it before ignoring me completely. It is giving the impression that that mistakes have been made and no one is willing to admit to them (I do not know for certain). I am now considering contacting the Korean Labor Board about them. Management blames others for their mistakes. Some of the materials in the curriculum were not level appropriate and very little time to adapt it. Refusals to believe that the books or children have been levelled incorrectly and  criticisms from managment  about your time management when you put in the neccessary extra time (extra to the designated prep time) to adapt the materials.,0.9988758,0.0009793867,0.00014476632

Unclear policies and a dictatorial approach to decisions. Promotions are given based on friendship and relationships not performance. Written regulations are not followed creating uncertainty. All decisions are made by a small group at the top with the President having the last word. Faculty (specially foreigners) are left out of the decision making process.

The university does not offer salary increase year on year or even when renewing contracts though the practice is against labour laws.  Some professors have not had the contracts reevaluated or changed in over 6 years.  Korean professor's tend get paid 60% more then international faculty.  Daegu does not offer much on the side of an active life as Seoul does.  People can tend to be conservative which leads to input by internal staff being side lined.  Issues with exam papers being checked by teachers assistants (students) have been noted.  Things are so dire that international academia have a private facebook page where complaints are logged.  Its a family run business and does feel like a dictator is keeping an eye on its play ground.,0.99891627,0.0009428321,0.00014089835

The university is run as the possession of the president and so decisions on promotions remuneration curriculum and regulations are made arbitrarily at his personal whim; pay is mediocre; campus food is horrendous; retention of foreign students is very bad; administration has a hostile and dismissive attitude towards foreign faculty in tenure promotions housing research funding and benefits. I saw fire doors locked; walkway lights to the dormitory turned out on January nights; a violent student threatening an instructorall ignored by administration.

Salary abuse: Korean staff get paid 30% to 80% more then international staff. Twice a year bonuses to Korean staff of 1000000 krw and up. The ground staff get paid more then the international staff. Family business: If you are connected or know anyone close to the university presidents family you can automatically be on a tenure contract as your first job.  Plagiarism: As salary increase is primarily dependent on number of papers issued or exhibition held most Local staff either plagiarises foreign papers into Korean and have it published in local journals or re use exhibition under new titles in different venues.  Bribery: Though university makes all its teaching faculty staff sign a form declaring no good or monetary amount will be taken from students or their family members this is not followed through. Gifts as small as coffee or meals are common to larger donations (that is what it is called in the uni) cash or luxury items are common.  African / Eastern European connection: Due to the shrinking nature of Korea's student population the university is scrambling to attract international students. But with only a handful of English speaking professors (one in each department) while most 3/5 professors in each department cannot even understand English. It  seems wrong information is being provided to foreign universities.   Cafeteria: Cannot provide food for special dietary students. Vegan students are at times told soups are vegetarian but contain pork or beef broth.  Pollution: exterme amount of food is wasted in cafeteria and dumped in 20 gallon bins (2030 a day). Students/Professors smoke and spit on the ground everywhere.  Students: You will have to deal with drunk /hungover students in your class twice a year at the very least. Students require smoke break each hour. They seems invested into their looks then the lecture (hair rollers and make cup mirrors are a common sight to be seen) Salary: Salary increase only happens after 7 years if you are luck and that to of just 10 %  this is foreign staff.,0.9985667,0.0012894282,0.00014391005

Regrettably though the courses are taught and assessed in English the admin does not support the students in acquiring higher levels of academic English. The profs in the English department have a higher workload and lower pay than the professors in every other department. Also because the academic English curriculum is determined by people in New York who have never been to Korea profs can't design classes that are useful for students.

I taught a few courses on US army bases for UMUC over the past several years. Recently after asking me to sign a new employment agreement for 2019 they notified me that I wouldn't be needed after all and that I was being dismissed. The stated reason for the dismissal was that I haven't been offered any course to teach for 18 months.  I asked several times about this 18 month policy as I couldn't find any mention of it anywhere on the faculty policy website. Finally after I sent several emails a person in HR told me that someone from academic affairs would be reaching out to me soon.  That was several weeks ago and I haven't heard anything more from anyone at UMUC.  They just ignore my emails and now they have closed my UMUC employee email account. I can't help but feel that I have been thrown under the bus. Has anyone else experienced anything like this at UMUC?,0.9984616,0.0014254192,0.00011300658
