Recently, after asking me to sign a new employment agreement for 2019, they notified me that I wouldn't be needed after all, and that I was being dismissed. The stated reason for the dismissal was that I haven't been offered any course to teach for 18 months.  I asked several times about this 18 month policy, as I couldn't find any mention of it anywhere on the faculty policy website. Finally, after I sent several emails, a person in HR told me that someone from academic affairs would be reaching out to me soon.  That was several weeks ago and I haven't heard anything more from anyone at UMUC.  They just ignore my emails and now they have closed my UMUC employee email account. I can't help but feel that I have been thrown under the bus. Has anyone else experienced anything like this at UMUC?"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "adjunct", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Adjunct Professor in Seoul", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Limited oversight, good flexibility, fun classroom experience.", "cons": "Taught 400 level courses to students who never had freshman comp."}]]
