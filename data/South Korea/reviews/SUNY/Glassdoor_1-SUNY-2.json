(If you want to come to Incheon, the other universities here pay much better than SUNY.)", "cons": "Regrettably, though the courses are taught and assessed in English, the admin does not support the students in acquiring higher levels of academic English. The profs in the English department have a higher workload and lower pay than the professors in every other department. Also, because the academic English curriculum is determined by people in New York who have never been to Korea, profs can't design classes that are useful for students. This reduces job satisfaction considerably."}]]
