Gifts as small as coffee or meals are common to larger donations (that is what it is called in the uni) cash or luxury items are common. \r\nAfrican / Eastern European connection: Due to the shrinking nature of Korea's student population the university is scrambling to attract international students. But with only a handful of English speaking professors (one in each department) while most 3/5 professors in each department cannot even understand English. It  seems wrong information is being provided to foreign universities.  \r\nCafeteria: Cannot provide food for special dietary students. Vegan students are at times told soups are vegetarian but contain pork or beef broth. \r\nPollution: exterme amount of food is wasted in cafeteria and dumped in 20 gallon bins (20-30 a day). Students/Professors smoke and spit on the ground everywhere. \r\nStudents: You will have to deal with drunk /hungover students in your class twice a year at the very least. Students require smoke break each hour.
