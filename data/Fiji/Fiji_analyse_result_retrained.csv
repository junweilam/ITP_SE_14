Interesting colleagues from around the world Most people travel heavily with opportunities to visit unique places Work can be really interesting but this largely depends on which division you work forthe organization operates as 7 related organizations at times Pretty transparent processes in terms of hiring compensation etc Good benefits compared to the US,0.00022640699,0.00035254614,0.9994211
Very disorganized at times without a clear vision Most people are on a 3 year contract so you can't get a promotion during that time unless you apply and are hired for a different position. This is rare as there are few relevant openings No support for spouses (who aren't allowed to work) Poor customer service from support areas (admin IT finance) For Americans: This company bases it's salary on the SDR and pays in local currency. This can have adverse impacts on your finances. i.e. I wasn't able to refinance my mortgage because of the combination of being on a 3year contract and being paid in foreign currency.,0.9991523,0.0006918025,0.00015592098
