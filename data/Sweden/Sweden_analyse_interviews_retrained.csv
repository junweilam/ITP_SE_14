The 1:1 interview focused on discussions of my research experience leadership experience communications experience and vision for a specific project. The employer was searching for someone who could switch between and integrate different resolution levels involved in project management from the design implementation analysis and interpretation of specific experiments to the recruitment management and training of team members to tactical decision making on project directions and also strategic decision making on long term project development and targeting.  A presentation to the host laboratory involved explanation of past findings methodological capabilities and most critically vision for the future of the project in question. Q and A was open ended but focused predominantly on scientific findings rather than project/management issues.  An extensive document (fitting a KI proforma) was required detailing past research training management and leadership experience. Publication lists conference and invited speaker presentations patents/licenses held commercialisation history and awards/fellowships/grants were all key parameters for external review by internationally renowned professors.,0.057957165,0.941458,0.0005848308
Had to work hard to make contact with group leader  they get tons of junk applications so if you don't hear from them by email don't give up. Emailed a couple times no word. Started calling office no answer. Eventually after many calls over a couple weeks was forwarded to secretary who took pity on me and gave me his cell phone number made contact. At this point he was already impressed which made the rest a lot easier. Flew over at group leader's expense. If you visit other group leaders there say so or they will get very annoyed. Made a research presentation (unusual for PhD studentships) two 1:1 interviews one with group leader other with close collaborator in the department. Very straightforward although I was familiar with the field no surprises no brainteasers. Generally was a discussion of projects science and personal history. Offered idea for a project which was clearly appreciated although equally clearly not seriously considered. Met lab members who described ongoing projects in the lab. Lunch with the boss and collaborator. Dinner with the lab minus boss. Overall exciting fun interesting busy and lots of information to absorb.,0.007237659,0.98936415,0.0033981511

Not professional at all. Supervisor was wearing pijamas during the interview process. Very biased interview.

I emailed the Professor twice one week apart and my emails got completely ignored.  I called the Professor 5 weeks after the interview and he told me he had been on vacation for the past two weeks and that he had already selected other candidates and I was effectively rejected.
