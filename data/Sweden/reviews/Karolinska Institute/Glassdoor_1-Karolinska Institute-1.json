Everyone takes off four weeks (or more) during summer (mostly July and August), and free time is not something strange to most people here (although some bosses work all the time and would prefer if their underlings did as well).\r\n\r\nThere are some excellent labs here. If you happen to work in one or collaborate with them, you can expect to do well and publish in excellent journals.\r\n\r\nStockholm is great. It is not a cheap city, and the housing situation is difficult (sign up for apartments as soon as you can!), but the air is clean, the tap water is drinkable (which is not the case in most US cities), people are relaxed and friendly overall, and quality of life is high.\r\n\r\nIf you are employed at Karolinska, you will be well taken care of. With your Swedish personal number (\"personnummer\") in hand, you will access to health care, child care etc., such that living here - especially when you have kids - is very nice.", "cons": "As others have mentioned, Karolinska as a place is very much defined by its history and traditions. The attitude of \"We are special and unique\" can be felt in some places, and certain formal issues are of great importance, which can seem a bit ridiculous in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nForeign postdocs are usually placed on stipends for their first two years, which makes it difficult for them to get access to healthcare  and other benefits mentioned above. There is now a Postdoc Association that is lobbying for change, and some change has already been achieved, but overall postdocs have fewer rights (and sometimes smaller salaries!) than Ph.D. students at Karolinska.\r\n\r\nIn many places at Karolinska (and in Sweden), there is a strong sense of entitlement. Swedish Ph.D. students often feel very much entitled to their rights, rather than realizing that they have to work hard to get a good educational experience. Administrators feel very much entitled to their free time and all kinds of strange off-days (besides the numerous holidays), so that \"getting things done\" can be difficult when it requires support from administrative staff. Don't get me wrong: I like that Sweden provides for a good work/life balance, but in a competitive environment such as global science, I can't help but feel slowed down on a regular basis because of other people in the organization.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned by others, Karolinska is rigged / run as a \"boys club\" in many ways. It is very important to know and be affiliated with the right people, otherwise your success within the organization can be severely limited. Folks who have been at Karolinska for several years know this, i.e. it is an open secret, yet nothing is done about it. Family ties (seriously!) can define the success of certain groups and group leaders, rather than their respective scientific excellence -- calling this nepotism or politics would be an understatement.\r\n\r\nKarolinska has strong policies regarding the proper conduct of research, transparency, harassment etc., but their implementation (at least from my point of view) leaves a lot to be desired. This leaves one with the impression of phony and hypocritical values, as opposed to real rigor and integrity."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Riding on it's reputation", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Jul 2013", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Stockholm, Stockholm", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Generally a high level of research, high publication rate in journals of good impact factors.

Access to a good benefits system IF (and only IF) paid by salary.", "cons": "1. Post-docs (that have not previously been at Karolinska) can be paid by stipends for up to two years. The minimum stipend is the same as a starting PhD student - Karolinska does not value international post-docs. The highest stipend may be sufficient to make up for the lack of any work related benefits (pension, parental leave, unemployment, ill health) but is rarely given.\r\n2. Karolinska infrastructure is very lacking, despite being almost completely duplicated at central and departmental level. Groups have to pay for rent for every last square meter of lab space, for karolinska e-mail addresses and in addition, 25% overhead is taken from every grant, with the overall impression being that very little is received from Karolinska in return for all this money and leaving every department more a building of groups than a coherent department.\r\n3. Due to stipend loophole described in 1., PhD students are working in much better conditions than post-docs on stipends in many cases. International post-docs on stipends are only recently being accepted into working unions and only recently allowed to apply for access to the state benefit system but there is still a lack of clarity and information in place.\r\n4. Perhaps the most difficult point to provide evidence for - there is a lack of transparency over a wide range of issues that affect international stipend funded post-doc working conditions. For instance, few realize that a stipend funded post-doc should have an agreed set of targets to achieve (similar to a study plan) for their period of research. This is rarely, if ever, enforced, to the detriment of the post-doc. On a stipend you technically have no contract, leaving you very vulnerable. Those with a salary and contract are limited by the contract not being provided in a paper copy but placed in many small areas on the intranet and often not adhered to. Running of departments, ways to get involved in teaching, organizing of departmental conferences, writing department newsletters, posts of responsibility etc. are given only to people directly known by the senior staff in the department, leaving those working in young groups with fewer opportunities to gain valuable experience or join in.\r\n5. Grant writing in Sweden, especially for international researchers, can frequently be a closed box, with no rational or feedback given and significant evidence for grants awarded to those associated with an 'old boys' style club."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bullying management, toxic environment", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Consulting Project Director in Solna, Stockholm", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Access to all available techniques, KI is a known brand and therefore gives \"credibility\".
