A supportive environment in which everyone places confidence in you.  Established global network.  Established tools (internal working systems materials etc).  You can have a lot of ownership and freedom to create your own team project...

If you are a type that needs someone to give you work details from AZ this is not a place for you. AIESEC is all about making mistakes learning from it and making ambitious things in a short period of time.

It can sometimes be a bit depressing to hear about how we pollute the world. Although Greenpeace is fighting to make a change it made me feel that there will be too little time to turn the pollution and climate change around.  As a developer there were not much career opportunities.  But those are the bad things I can come up with from my perspective.,0.99889153,0.00095888047,0.00014950642

 Bullying in order to force out employees was common usually enacted by management at different levels who were aided by HR. At no fewer than four occasions did I witness a person who just had broken down by how they were treated. At least one had to be taken to a mental ward (and then quietly dropped by Greenpeace Nordic at once afterwards).    Racist remarks by one staffer towards three POC were reported to HR. HR chose to take no action.    Management was deeply misogynistic both at organisation and volunteer level. Esp one Volunteer Coordinator seemed to use the volunteers as a dating pool and kept dating different volunteers often at the same time.    Organisation Veterans could act with impunity. I was twice threatened by organisation veterans who where never punished for their behavior.   Project Employees were expected to stay on but never got any word about a new contract until their last week. They were then treated as traitors for moving on.   Salaries for organisation veterans were usually above average with some excuse as to why. Salaries for everybody else was below average. Asking for a raise for any reason got at least one person sacked.,0.9985868,0.0012684773,0.00014476516

It's sucks you in like quicksand. High divorce & separation rate. I see you must protect your personal life on the campaign side.

Considering the context's hardship the communications between the units of one delegation sometimes goes down in responding to the recommendations provided other unit. The local field officers afford heavy tasks in a societies of needy people who do not care about the regular work hours. In few cases the brave management only can change the orientation of project implementation depending on the pop up facts. Comparing to other organizations the ICRC pay less for the local staff.

"The administration has no idea how to handle an international student the phd students are paid lower than in other schools. There is no protection against what a professor might want to do to a student. A lot of things are very unclearly negotiated contracts abruptly end salaries are changed on whim. Many people in positions of power simply don't care about the lower ones. Things like IT don't really work the student needs to be a handyman an IT or whatever else that might be required all at once without support. No prospects of getting to higher positions within the insitute. It is actually not even allowed to be employed by Karolinska after finishing PhD (max 2 years). In certain environments everyone is swedish. Central emails are sent in swedish disregarding internationals that don't speak the language. Many things are not compensated since ""they are not allowed"". Work visas are renewed every year costs a lot and are never compensated.",0.9990872,0.0007606911,0.00015207549

Ki has a modern infrastructure with potentially good access to relevant clinical samples to conduct translational research. The nearby SciLife provides great technological platforms. There are many internal and external research grants available for researchers to apply at any stage of their career and collaboration and mobility programs for students.

KI is an OK place to work as long as you are NOT an ambitious young researchers who wants to push his/her career to the next level (without political connections). There are some great groups that do excellent fastpaced work and you may have a chance to boost your career based only on your merits there but choose wisely. In general I would say that most of the research staff is quite relaxed and almost impossible to push to get things done quickly especially if that entails working extra hours. Criticisms are not received well and it is hard to address structural issues resulting in a quite unprofessional environment. For postdocs. Postdocs from abroad are systematically recruited on a stipend (no taxes=no benefits) for 2 years or so with no fixed pay scheme but only 'recommended' levels. This affects in particular nonEU citizens and may result in cases where postdocs earn less than graduate students or technicians to do way more work. This clashes with the expensive cost of living in Stockholm and the inaccessible public housing system to foreigners.,0.9942925,0.004937949,0.0007695521

The pay is low and the minimum only recently became above that of a PhD student recently  and that increase was due to pressure from the KI Postdoc Association. Despite some effort centrally to increase the information given to newly arrived postdocs this relies on the staff in the departments to pass it on. This is patchy at best.  Lack of a clear career ladder or career goalposts. It is unclear why people receive funding.  Nepotism.  An unwillingness to embrace change.,0.9990834,0.0007633467,0.00015327278

Can be a great place for a PhD if you find the right group matches your interest. Courses and research schools are organised at the university level to allow you top up your knowledge. They can be very useful to allow you to broad your knowledge and network with other students and researchers.

The resources available at each department and each group can be quite different. Different departments can have different rules regarding to PhD education. It can also take some time to really know the system well (but guess thats the same everywhere). There are quite a lot of administration and form fillings that need to be done. Some information are circulated only in Swedish and so you can miss out information (and sometimes important ones) if you don't know Swedish language.,0.46944878,0.53014684,0.0004043687
"Karolinska Institute is well known worldwide i.e. as a ""CV element"" it is good to have worked here.  Swedish work/life balance is probably second to none. Everyone takes off four weeks (or more) during summer (mostly July and August) and free time is not something strange to most people here (although some bosses work all the time and would prefer if their underlings did as well).  There are some excellent labs here. If you happen to work in one or collaborate with them you can expect to do well and publish in excellent journals.  Stockholm is great. It is not a cheap city and the housing situation is difficult (sign up for apartments as soon as you can!) but the air is clean the tap water is drinkable (which is not the case in most US cities) people are relaxed and friendly overall and quality of life is high.  If you are employed at Karolinska you will be well taken care of. With your Swedish personal number (""personnummer"") in hand you will access to health care child care etc. such that living here  especially when you have kids  is very nice.",0.0015354003,0.012659772,0.98580486
"As others have mentioned Karolinska as a place is very much defined by its history and traditions. The attitude of ""We are special and unique"" can be felt in some places and certain formal issues are of great importance which can seem a bit ridiculous in the 21st century.  Foreign postdocs are usually placed on stipends for their first two years which makes it difficult for them to get access to healthcare  and other benefits mentioned above. There is now a Postdoc Association that is lobbying for change and some change has already been achieved but overall postdocs have fewer rights (and sometimes smaller salaries!) than Ph.D. students at Karolinska.  In many places at Karolinska (and in Sweden) there is a strong sense of entitlement. Swedish Ph.D. students often feel very much entitled to their rights rather than realizing that they have to work hard to get a good educational experience. Administrators feel very much entitled to their free time and all kinds of strange offdays (besides the numerous holidays) so that ""getting things done"" can be difficult when it requires support from administrative staff. Don't get me wrong: I like that Sweden provides for a good work/life balance but in a competitive environment such as global science I can't help but feel slowed down on a regular basis because of other people in the organization.  As mentioned by others Karolinska is rigged / run as a ""boys club"" in many ways. It is very important to know and be affiliated with the right people otherwise your success within the organization can be severely limited. Folks who have been at Karolinska for several years know this i.e. it is an open secret yet nothing is done about it. Family ties (seriously!) can define the success of certain groups and group leaders rather than their respective scientific excellence  calling this nepotism or politics would be an understatement.  Karolinska has strong policies regarding the proper conduct of research transparency harassment etc. but their implementation (at least from my point of view) leaves a lot to be desired. This leaves one with the impression of phony and hypocritical values as opposed to real rigor and integrity.",0.99739826,0.0024127623,0.0001888744
Generally a high level of research high publication rate in journals of good impact factors. Reasonably good funds for experiments good access to equipment and good opportunities for collaborations with in the university. Access to a good benefits system IF (and only IF) paid by salary.,0.00025437973,0.00022848515,0.9995171
1. Postdocs (that have not previously been at Karolinska) can be paid by stipends for up to two years. The minimum stipend is the same as a starting PhD student  Karolinska does not value international postdocs. The highest stipend may be sufficient to make up for the lack of any work related benefits (pension parental leave unemployment ill health) but is rarely given. 2. Karolinska infrastructure is very lacking despite being almost completely duplicated at central and departmental level. Groups have to pay for rent for every last square meter of lab space for karolinska email addresses and in addition 25% overhead is taken from every grant with the overall impression being that very little is received from Karolinska in return for all this money and leaving every department more a building of groups than a coherent department. 3. Due to stipend loophole described in 1. PhD students are working in much better conditions than postdocs on stipends in many cases. International postdocs on stipends are only recently being accepted into working unions and only recently allowed to apply for access to the state benefit system but there is still a lack of clarity and information in place. 4. Perhaps the most difficult point to provide evidence for  there is a lack of transparency over a wide range of issues that affect international stipend funded postdoc working conditions. For instance few realize that a stipend funded postdoc should have an agreed set of targets to achieve (similar to a study plan) for their period of research. This is rarely if ever enforced to the detriment of the postdoc. On a stipend you technically have no contract leaving you very vulnerable. Those with a salary and contract are limited by the contract not being provided in a paper copy but placed in many small areas on the intranet and often not adhered to. Running of departments ways to get involved in teaching organizing of departmental conferences writing department newsletters posts of responsibility etc. are given only to people directly known by the senior staff in the department leaving those working in young groups with fewer opportunities to gain valuable experience or join in. 5. Grant writing in Sweden especially for international researchers can frequently be a closed box with no rational or feedback given and significant evidence for grants awarded to those associated with an 'old boys' style club.,0.9989918,0.00085988804,0.00014822562

Postdocs are purely temporary workers could get unemployed whenever the PI decides so. Turnover is unusually high. Most people can't finish their projects not to mention publish. What's more it is very difficult to get funding without connection. It's a lot of nepotism and lack of transparency. There is very little chance to advance an academic career as a postdoc partly due to high competition but mostly because no one cares about postdocs,0.9991442,0.0007005656,0.00015516394
Incredible opportunities for networking if you have the guts to try and perseverance: PhD studentinitiated summer schools and course featuring megastar scientists from around the world  Group leaders are generally very friendly and happy to help  important if your own supervisor frequently unavailable which as everywhere can be the case.  Able regularly to attract the absolute best scientists from around the world for seminars conferences etc. that unquestionably blows most other top universities out of the water and is on a par with Cambridge MA California and Cambridge UK. This is of course due in part to KI's role in awarding Nobel Prize.  Many truly worldleading researchers though some departments obviously stronger than others.  Solna campus is quite attractive and pretty close to Stockholm centre (but Huddinge campus is the armpit of Sweden and very far from downtown).  PhD studentship is generally solid but not overly long (avg ~5 years). PhD's from otherwise similar labs have consistently and substantially greater competence than those with <4 years and have more to show for it as several publications are a de facto requirement.

Postdocs have a relatively bad deal: salary barely higher than PhD students stipend only no benefits will rarely be funded by supervisor longer than 2 years because law requires them to be employed thereafter.  To be a group leader you need to get your own funding in advance from external sources and you always have to pay large overhead.  No strong sense of University spirit (absolutely does not compare to US system but similar to UK). Despite many social events few if any are Institutewide.  In Sweden:  incredibly high cost of living without very good pay (especially considering working hours). housing especially problematic. much easier to buy property in the Stockholm area  although this is changing  but otherwise make sure your employer arranges a few months' accommodation BEFORE you arrive.

"Really research the supervisor you are going to work with. Some professors have very strong connections and are toxic. They will use this power in conflicts and have zero care for the career of a student. Ask from their previous students etc. This becomes extra important if you are an immigrant and dependant on your Visa to stay in the country. Professors know this and will use it to their benefit.  On the KTH website it is stated that students have the right to change supervisor for any reason however this is practically very hard and is covered in layers of politics. In cases of conflict professors in high positions will have each other's back and the student will suffer badly. HR and other systems in place for handling these conflicts have zero actual power and keep themselves out of any conflicts at the cost of the student. These problems seem to be  Some professors have toxic rivalries and resentment toward each other and they have no problem dragging their students into this. I knew these things are quite common in academia because of the large power professors have but was expecting the situation to be better at a ""Swedish"" institute.

As an employee you are a part of a great and intelectually stimulating environment. PhD students are compensated with a well above average salary for Sweden as well as the EU.

There are large variances between different departments in the way they work how they value research requirements for obtaining a PhD degree and their expectations from the PhD student.

Working at one of the best European technical universities  offers great opportunity for conducting research.

The team has good potential to produce relevant research on climate change and energy issues.,0.00016394535,0.00020586702,0.9996302
In sum the unit has serious managerial problems. These are evident in the approach of the management which is completely in contrast to Western European standards and especially Swedish. Workers are constantly criticized without being given exact tasks and instructions to perform them.  Among themselves they regularly complain about different types of humiliation they experienced from the management.  Because of this atmosphere there is a lack of team spirit  instead all work in fear and stress.  It is a very difficult place to work because management has high demands but does not devote time to workers on defining their tasks. In addition feedback is limited and poor and is exhibited by the constant criticism.,0.9990571,0.0007990386,0.00014387627

Smart people around you you get to take a lot of responsibilities managing students and your own research. In my department we have a lot of industrial collaboration which is a good way to network. KTH is located near the city of Stockholm which makes it easy to get lunch with colleagues from other companies. Good benefits with christmas lunches conference trips student discounts gym membership premiums etc. Start salaries for PhD students are comparable to start salaries as an engineer in industries if you account for all the benefits we receive.,0.0002014723,0.00025583236,0.9995427
As a PhD you get a lot of administrative burden with students conference trips and more. Sometimes you wonder why they can't employ someone to take over some of this burden so that we can spend more time on our research.

1) More relaxed/easygoing environment in comparison to other universities. 2) Good research and funding. 3) Freedom to innovate and pursue your own leads/ideas. 4) Good salary for the PhD level 5) People are friendly and helpful although you will need to often need to initiate contact with others. 6) You are an employee but at the same time are also classified as a student so you can use this to obtain discounts on subway fare electronics etc. 7) You get a small annual stipend for health related things (like gym massage etc).,0.00021027615,0.00026007395,0.9995297
1) PhD takes very long (about 5 years).  2) Part of the PhD taking longer is that you will be required to teach undergraduate students and perhaps assist in masters courses. This is not a bad thing however it can take ALOT of your time (sometimes 1pm5pm 23 days a week). 3) On top of teaching you also have to take your own courses. Some credits can be carried over from Masters depending on your university and if the courses were up to the standard set at KTH. However expect to take about 68 courses total over the entire degree. 3) Things can move too slow sometimes.

This is addressed to anyone who considers to do a PhD:  The Ph.D. comes along with a strong dependency on your principal supervisor. This dependency is sometimes used by the supervisor to make pressure on the PhD student e.g. to be the coauthor on a paper of the student although the contribution was only minor not reviewing the paper and delays on purpose to make the student work on departmental work rather than research etc.   Some supervisors are very hierarchical and treat students with very little respect for example: yelling or not considering the opinion of the PhD student. Some research engineers are dismissed with 1 month notice. Some supervisors create their own system within the KTH system and force alignment of their direct employees to their own rules.  I was employed at the Energy and Climate studies Unit (ECS).  Many colleagues have experienced extremely disrespectful treatment here...,0.9986129,0.0012463105,0.0001408635

"Inflexibility resistance to change or to accept new ideas that are not ""Swedish"". lazy staff no one wants to work and they engage in endless fika (i.e. coffee break).  They claim they are creating worklife balance but it is actually the foreigners who work in our department. There is a hidden agreedupon approach for systematic discrimination if you are not Swedish or related to a Swede or you don't speak Swedish although the university claims to be ""international"".
