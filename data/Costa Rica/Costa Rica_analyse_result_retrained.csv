Job satisfaction can vary depending on the leadership in your department.  in 20 years at Sharp I've had wonderfuland terrible managers.  I do best when I'm given a little direction and then allowed to match my strengths to the needs of the dept.  Some people need more oversight in order to be productive.  The trick is finding a manager who can do either or both depending on the employee.,0.028188849,0.97111267,0.00069858483
