I wasn't collected from the airport as my buddy got the wrong day, I was left for 2 days at my host family not being contacted by aiesec so not knowing what was next. I was told that if I didn't speak the language it wouldn't be a problem - it was. I was told that most they volunteers would be from Europe or speak English at least, they were from Brazil and Mexico and not many could speak English. The project was only 3/4 days a week for a few hours so most of the time was boring. It was difficult to communicate with the children in the orphanage as I didn't speak the language. The other volunteers didn't often have the money or effort to do other activities or explore the city so most days were boring. Aiesec in Lima in UPC university was unorganised, I only met the person who interviewed me 2 times for 5 minutes! The leader went away so a vice leader was in the office but was ALWAYS late to the meetings we started to have and she never answered her phone, ever. Overall the experience with aiesec was terrible, it's just students running it and not getting paid so they don't always put much effort in. I was just left to figure it out myself and try and make the most of it but I would never travel with aisec again. The only things I enjoyed we're the traveling that two kind Peruvians arranged for us (who were not in aiesec) and the friends I made."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great Chances to Learn", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Volunteer in Lima, Lima Region", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You can learn, network and add great things to your CV!
