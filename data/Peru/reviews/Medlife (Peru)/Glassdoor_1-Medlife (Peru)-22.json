However, if you are goal-oriented, flexible, and able to work in fast-paced environments you will thrive. \r\n\r\nIf you bring value to the organization you may be considered for a manager position within a reasonable time instead of having to wait 10 years to go through several positions on an org chart. \r\n\r\nNo real hierarchy. Interns, management and the CEO will all be together in meetings constantly which means if you have great ideas, speak up because you can be heard. \r\n\r\nSmall team allows you to easily foster a relationship with colleagues and management. I started as an intern in 2016 and by the time I left I had friends who have become part of my life. \r\n\r\nThe CEO (Nick) is someone who constantly supported my career/life goals even if that meant moving abroad or making a career shift to another company. He is always willing to chat about non-work topics too so don't be surprised if he knows your pet's name or gives you advice on opening your first brokerage account.

There is a strong sense of mission and responsibility to the people and communities we serve that starts with the founder Dr Nick Ellis. It is important to mention that the founder (not owner) does not receive a salary from the organization. He recently shared the financials with the organization following recent glassdoor posts in order to provide total transparency to the team - while I will not share them here, I will say that they are not at all similar to what has been presented in the previous negative reviews, I suppose it is easier to believe the worst in someone. Nick at many times has gone over and above to support people on the team so its really a shame to see him and his family dragged through the mud here.\r\n\r\nIt has been incredible to work alongside committed leaders and individuals during a time of crisis, the team has come together and will be stronger for it.

A culturally diverse team brought together by the unifying desire to truly relieve the suffering of countless communities around the world. Experienced MEDLIFE staff develop an unparalleled capacity to show and make decisions with both empathy and compassion while still keeping an eye on the larger goals at hand for the organization and movement.\r\n\r\n- Top Down Work Ethic\r\nMEDLIFE as an organization has the strongest work ethic of any organization that I have ever been apart of. This can be traced directly back to the Founder of the organization. MEDLIFE staff truly work for the communities. Teams consistently go above and beyond the expectations of their position as well as the expectations from their superiors. In my opinion this is a reflection of two themes that are strongly rooted in the organization. The first is that staff truly care about the communities they serve. It is a clear mandate to \"treat patients as if they were family\" and that means putting in the effort to ensure that working in solidarity is of the utmost personal importance to every member of staff. The second reason for such overwhelming unity in this area is embodied by Dr. Ellis. He has always served MEDLIFE above and beyond the expectations of any normal CEO. He was forced to juggle Med School and Residency while managing an NGO for nearly a decade. Even today, Dr. Ellis spends half of every month as an ER Doctor in the United States of America and then the other half at one of MEDLIFE's sites. The pure will and determination it takes to split your personal and professional career across two countries in order to simply bring a better quality of life to people he has yet to meet is a sacrifice that few would make - and that the staff of MEDLIFE embody and show their appreciation with their own strong work ethic.", "cons": "- Clear Organizational Communication\r\nOn the day of this review, MEDLIFE staff are spread across 5 countries, several languages and dozens of geographical and personal cultures. This can be a strength but often is a challenge. Juggling timezones, connectivity and depersonalized communication methods (email, text) it is easy to lose a message or direction and have different sites or teams pulling in similar yet different directions. The root of this problem are communication practices which are improving significantly and not the remote offices themselves.\r\n\r\n- Emotional Toll\r\nNormally I would say that a level of emotional connection to your work is something to be desired. Within MEDLIFE I think the emotional connection that staff have with communities and patients is essential and one of the strongest assets that exist for motivation and organization unity. That being said, the realities faced by communities are real and arduous. MEDLIFE's work, just like life in general does not always have a happy ending and this can be straining to those who might not have the experience or emotional intelligence/maturity to understand when they are reaching a point where taking a step back is important. This is not a criticism necessarily of MEDLIFE but a reality of the work.  It is impossible to effectively advocate for people without understanding their stories - but those stories can also take involve a lot of raw emotion that needs to be managed delicately.  Staff should be aware of this and Managers should keep an eye out for these moments to ensure that others can take a step back to collect themselves and not let it effect people in a way that can be very emotionally taxing and distract from the mission."}]]
