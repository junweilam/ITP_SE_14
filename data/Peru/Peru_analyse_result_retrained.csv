Unfortunately although the aiesec organisation in your home country or university may be great or really helpful they couldn't possibly have visited all the possible locations that aiesec can take you I decided I wanted to visited South America and chose Lima Peru as I thought that it was possibly a safe choice. I wasn't collected from the airport as my buddy got the wrong day I was left for 2 days at my host family not being contacted by aiesec so not knowing what was next. I was told that if I didn't speak the language it wouldn't be a problem  it was. I was told that most they volunteers would be from Europe or speak English at least they were from Brazil and Mexico and not many could speak English. The project was only 3/4 days a week for a few hours so most of the time was boring. It was difficult to communicate with the children in the orphanage as I didn't speak the language. The other volunteers didn't often have the money or effort to do other activities or explore the city so most days were boring. Aiesec in Lima in UPC university was unorganised I only met the person who interviewed me 2 times for 5 minutes! The leader went away so a vice leader was in the office but was ALWAYS late to the meetings we started to have and she never answered her phone ever. Overall the experience with aiesec was terrible it's just students running it and not getting paid so they don't always put much effort in. I was just left to figure it out myself and try and make the most of it but I would never travel with aisec again. The only things I enjoyed we're the traveling that two kind Peruvians arranged for us (who were not in aiesec) and the friends I made.,0.99442416,0.005355532,0.00022038668

The best things about MEDLIFE are the people and the support provided to the partner communities:   You will get to visit the field constantly depending on your job which is really what helps you understand your job/mission better and see the MED Programs team in action.   You get to travel internationally to other locations and the org has become almost completely remote since COVID started which means you can work with your pajama pants next to your dog.   It definitely is a work hard/play hard type of culture. However if you are goaloriented flexible and able to work in fastpaced environments you will thrive.   If you bring value to the organization you may be considered for a manager position within a reasonable time instead of having to wait 10 years to go through several positions on an org chart.   No real hierarchy. Interns management and the CEO will all be together in meetings constantly which means if you have great ideas speak up because you can be heard.   Small team allows you to easily foster a relationship with colleagues and management. I started as an intern in 2016 and by the time I left I had friends who have become part of my life.   The CEO (Nick) is someone who constantly supported my career/life goals even if that meant moving abroad or making a career shift to another company. He is always willing to chat about nonwork topics too so don't be surprised if he knows your pet's name or gives you advice on opening your first brokerage account. The guy has 10 new ideas each week help him dissect the great ones from the good ones and focus on how to implement the first ones. Do that and you will be set!,0.0034460986,0.015401116,0.9811528

I actually worked for MEDLife for only 3 months about a year ago. Found this recent review and decided that I’ll review myself. I cannot stress enough how accurate these reviews are especially the last one.   I was told I will have the opportunity to be a part of something bigger contribute and make the organization better. Truth is my ideas never really mattered. No matter what I proposed the decision comes down to the CEO and expansion manager who said my proposals were written by a third grader. This “global company” doesn’t care about their employees.  It may seem good in the beginning but if you don’t meet their unrealistic expectations your time is up. They start with the “work here for 3 months and we will give you a full year if you do well” excuse to exploit tourists. Don’t buy into it. They never really explain what you need to do very well anyway.   The CEO gave us a big lecture on how we need to avoid making communities feel like western countries are coming into their lives like colonists. However he does just that. Don’t buy into this nonprofit. Glad I got “terminated”.  Expansion manager isn’t good. Rude cliquey and chooses who she likes. Only those people will move on on he company but not by much.,0.9980636,0.0017602326,0.00017611902
I worked with Medlife for two years in their Lima office an intern and then as an Associate of Student Affairs and can say it was a pivotal part of my career. It was a wonderful opportunity to work abroad and be surrounded by supportive coworkers that were motivated by the organization's mission of serving underdeveloped communities. The organization is dedicated to improving the infrastructure of local communities and to providing followup care to patients requiring ongoing treatment. I saw firsthand how many communities grew and improved from their staircase and clean water projects during my time there. I would recommend Medlife to anyone looking for a position where they can be a selfstarter in a job that has a true impact.,0.0002401041,0.00029549084,0.99946445

Having worked for the NGO you can see on a daily basis the help that Medlife provides to low income communities.  The organization is structured to spend as little on administrative expenses as possible the CEO is a volunteer the HQ is in Lima Peru and all employees are encouraged to go into the field as often as possible.,0.0012173923,0.0017449202,0.99703765
Because Medlife tries to save money on administrative expenses it has in the past hired very inexperienced employees and interns who often have had very strong opinions without professional experience to backup those opinions and that has created a negative environment.,0.9988655,0.0009651651,0.00016929307
I felt the need to add my experience in the organization which is in stark contrast to some of the previous reviews which I find totally unfair and one aimed at hurting or damaging the organization.  First of all MEDLIFE is a US non profit organization  which means financials are open and transparent  they can be found on the medlife website. There is a strong sense of mission and responsibility to the people and communities we serve that starts with the founder Dr Nick Ellis. It is important to mention that the founder (not owner) does not receive a salary from the organization. He recently shared the financials with the organization following recent glassdoor posts in order to provide total transparency to the team  while I will not share them here I will say that they are not at all similar to what has been presented in the previous negative reviews I suppose it is easier to believe the worst in someone. Nick at many times has gone over and above to support people on the team so its really a shame to see him and his family dragged through the mud here.  It has been incredible to work alongside committed leaders and individuals during a time of crisis the team has come together and will be stronger for it. While most organizations are in hibernation mode waiting for things to return to normal we are forging ahead trying to support the communities that need it most.,0.60435444,0.39158475,0.004060819
It has been a challenging and difficult time for the entire team dealing with everything COVID related and it has put stress on everyone in the organization. Still it has been inspiring to see the organization step up to support those in need at this time and I believe it has given everyone a greater sense of purpose.,0.09555519,0.3401043,0.5643405

" Colleagues MEDLIFE attracts and retains some of the greatest people I have personally had the pleasure of working alongside during my professional career. A culturally diverse team brought together by the unifying desire to truly relieve the suffering of countless communities around the world. Experienced MEDLIFE staff develop an unparalleled capacity to show and make decisions with both empathy and compassion while still keeping an eye on the larger goals at hand for the organization and movement.   Top Down Work Ethic MEDLIFE as an organization has the strongest work ethic of any organization that I have ever been apart of. This can be traced directly back to the Founder of the organization. MEDLIFE staff truly work for the communities. Teams consistently go above and beyond the expectations of their position as well as the expectations from their superiors. In my opinion this is a reflection of two themes that are strongly rooted in the organization. The first is that staff truly care about the communities they serve. It is a clear mandate to ""treat patients as if they were family"" and that means putting in the effort to ensure that working in solidarity is of the utmost personal importance to every member of staff. The second reason for such overwhelming unity in this area is embodied by Dr. Ellis. He has always served MEDLIFE above and beyond the expectations of any normal CEO. He was forced to juggle Med School and Residency while managing an NGO for nearly a decade. Even today Dr. Ellis spends half of every month as an ER Doctor in the United States of America and then the other half at one of MEDLIFE's sites. The pure will and determination it takes to split your personal and professional career across two countries in order to simply bring a better quality of life to people he has yet to meet is a sacrifice that few would make  and that the staff of MEDLIFE embody and show their appreciation with their own strong work ethic.",0.31247923,0.32615244,0.36136833
 Clear Organizational Communication On the day of this review MEDLIFE staff are spread across 5 countries several languages and dozens of geographical and personal cultures. This can be a strength but often is a challenge. Juggling timezones connectivity and depersonalized communication methods (email text) it is easy to lose a message or direction and have different sites or teams pulling in similar yet different directions. The root of this problem are communication practices which are improving significantly and not the remote offices themselves.   Emotional Toll Normally I would say that a level of emotional connection to your work is something to be desired. Within MEDLIFE I think the emotional connection that staff have with communities and patients is essential and one of the strongest assets that exist for motivation and organization unity. That being said the realities faced by communities are real and arduous. MEDLIFE's work just like life in general does not always have a happy ending and this can be straining to those who might not have the experience or emotional intelligence/maturity to understand when they are reaching a point where taking a step back is important. This is not a criticism necessarily of MEDLIFE but a reality of the work.  It is impossible to effectively advocate for people without understanding their stories  but those stories can also take involve a lot of raw emotion that needs to be managed delicately.  Staff should be aware of this and Managers should keep an eye out for these moments to ensure that others can take a step back to collect themselves and not let it effect people in a way that can be very emotionally taxing and distract from the mission.,0.9934042,0.0063569886,0.00023887273
