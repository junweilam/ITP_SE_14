They are reckless leaders, completely oblivious to how low morale is, and worst of all, they are willing to demoralize their employees to make a point. As a result, the employee attrition rate has skyrocketed. 7) Hard work will not advance you at Africare. If senior leadership likes you enough, they'll make a new position for you.

They are reckless leaders, completely oblivious to how low morale is, and worst of all, they are willing to demoralize their employees to make a point. As a result, the employee attrition rate has skyrocketed. 7) Hard work will not advance you at Africare. If senior leadership likes you enough, they'll make a new position for you.
