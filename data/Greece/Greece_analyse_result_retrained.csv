A lot of drama and lack of professionalism (probably because it is organized solely by students) which often leads to a toxic environment.Quite difficult to keep a balance between your studies and your work. In many cases volunteers are required to work after leaving office. In many cases superiors put pressure to new team members to do things (e.g. host people) that they dont want to forgetting that this work is ENTIRELY VOLUNTEER!!Many volunteers care only about bringing results to their supervisors and they dont care about the quality of work.,0.9989072,0.0009373167,0.00015548083

 Ideal environment for someone to meet new cultures and cooperate with people from all over the world.  Great  Team Experience especially when you move up in hierarchy because you have to manage a team of students that work voluntarily like you   Many AIESEC events take place where you can meet members from many other territories  Companies share knowledge with you and help you become more professional on your work  You gain valuable experience on fields such as Sales Marketing HR Finance Customer Service   You take responsibilities that you probably wouldn't have the opportunity to take if you would have chosen to work on something parallel to your studies.  Fast promotions to higher positions (Executive Boards of AIESEC change every year)   Constant Support and lifetime friends.,0.000379605,0.00039864331,0.9992217
 Work/ Life Balance is the main disadvantage. As you move up in hierarchy you have to commit a lot of time to complete the tasks needed. In addition to that you have to  perform well on your university.  It is voluntary so you have to be careful on your finances or maybe work parttime in order to get by and be financially independent.  After AIESEC it is common to feel that you know a lot of things on your field. It is true that you gain a lot more skills and experiences in comparison to a plain student but it is important to let your mind free when you get into the job market. AIESEC works in a certain way and the job market in a different one. Don't compare AIESEC to your future workplace because it is not the same.,0.63842577,0.36083803,0.0007362359
It promotes diversity. It gives you also the opportunity to expand your social network and provides you with experience needed for your future career.
