The organisation is OK as a start within the international development sector. However, if you do get other choices, go for something else. Many complain that the organisation is toxic and not rewarding people that deserve to be. From what I have seen, I can agree with this in part. Don't expect to be appreciated or respected for the extra efforts and ideas that you will want to bring onboard and implement in your daily workload. It will not be the type of organisation that you would like to serve on a long term or develop a career within. Most are leaving with the first better occasion that they get. So, if you plan or ended up working for IDLO (as you have no other better choice), do yourself a favour and keep looking for some other opportunities. Don't get to comfy or devoted to the organisation or your department. The management is very poor, thinking only about the internal impact to themselves and this module is replicated on all levels. In fact, most of the leadership likes to portrait results obtained by their teams as their own ideas, forgetting to recognise the hard efforts and great expertise of actual people that worked on those. The organisation is trying to find new ways to growth and develop into a better development institution (regularly by copying bigger agencies and development entities), but failing to do so as there is to much inside bureaucracy and lack of commitment to own staff. It is unfortunate and shameful (as it could be different), but there is a total lack of communication between organisations' divisions, management, and a clear lack of stability regarding the future career growth and now support for personal career development."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Overall good place to work with nice and international colleagues", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Regional Program Accountant in Rome", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "relatively high salary\r\n1/2 of the month with quite decent working hours\r\nmoral boost from contributing to a positive impact in developing economies", "cons": "low possibilities to grow and be promoted \r\nmanagement at the time was not the best, as they were often disorganized and not clear in the instructions given"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Would not recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Program Manager in Rome", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great colleagues at the working level", "cons": "Consistently poor management and HR"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bad management and work conditions", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Consultant in Rome", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly, international Part of staff,", "cons": "They not maintained there promises, bad and selfish management."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Admirable Mission - Poor Execution", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Jul 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Rome", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Will have lots of responsibility which could sometimes be relevant to your career path\r\nGood office location", "cons": "No direction, poor management.
