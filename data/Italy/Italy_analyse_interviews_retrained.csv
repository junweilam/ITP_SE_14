I applied online through the WFP website. After 3 weeks I was asked to do an interview by zoom. I met with 4 people in the Panel. It was a challenging yet very interesting interview. They asked me about the application and some background history. They asked why I want to work for the WFP. I received an email one week after saying that although my interview was very good I didn't get the job because of the lack of experience in the UN system.,0.03892233,0.9589582,0.0021194555

The invitation to Interview was an email that had been forwarded which I felt could have been avoided to make it feel more personal. I had two interviews pretty normal competency based questions around teamwork and leadership skills. I applied for the position in December  first Interview was in April and the next one in May so a rather lengthy process! After 3 weeks I asked for feedback and was advised they would get back to me after 2 more weeks. I asked one more time after that and I have still not heard anything back from them. I will leave it at that. I understand that there are a lot of candidates for these positions but I still think they should have the courtesy to inform you if you weren't successful after your interviews or just update the online status...

Lots of mail and two Skype interviews with a very fast process. All of this process was unproductive due to their strict guidelines regarding interns and to the lack of attention of the recruiters (no appropriate interviews with a brief and rude mail to explain the negative feedback): it looked like they needed an intern (maybe for the summer) but they're looking for a perfect candidate.,0.99871004,0.0011251448,0.00016475038
"I applied online in November and was called for a phone interview in December after which I was asked to write a report summarizing the  interview I had. A few weeks latter I was invited for a technical text which was sent to me via email and I had to submit my response within 24 hours. This was the most intensive UN (technical) text I have ever written (I have written more than 10 of them for other UN organization). Basically I was given a report based on which I had to prepare my audit plan. I was then invited to Rome for a Face to Face interview after which I was supervised to write a 2 hour management test mainly to test my soft skills and how I am able to prioritize my work in the real work environment. After this I had the opportunity to be interviewed by the Inspector General. 8 of us made it to this stage.  A few weeks latter they came back to me saying the position has been offered to a more senior candidate. However because they were very impressed with my performance through the whole process they would offer me a lower level position (which was one level lower than what I had applied for) if I would accept it and depending on my performance on the job I will be considered for that higher level post if any became vacant in future. well I was very disappointed but it sounded like a very good opportunity for advancement in my career and it was in the field I had longed to get back to so I accepted. Additionally they had given me a very good impression of WFP throughout the whole process so .... it sounded like an organization I would love to be a part of. Finally and lastly I was invited for a French test since I had listed French as my second language. My phone number was given to a testing company to call me and their number was also given to me. Because I had already read on this site about someone's experience where he was called an hour latter than I agreed I decided to call the  testing company myself when they were 10 minutes late. It was an oral and listening test to determine my level in French. The evaluator was speaking at normal speed so it was not very fast. some of the questions asked were: tell me about yourself what will you do this weekend where do you normally go when you want to be alone where would you like to go on pension describe how to make tea how will you describe the global economy to someone what will you say to a friend who invited you to a party but you would not be able to attend because of other commitments etc. In all I think they asked about 20 questions but I am not very sure and it took exactly 30 minutes to complete the test. I googled how to prepare for a language test and I found many helpful sites. One of the most helpful websites had an article called ""How to prepare for a foreign language oral or speaking exam and succeed and do well"". All the tips given here were very helpful. There was also another site with an article called ""How to prepare for your foreign language oral exam"". Soon after writing the exam I received the intent of offer email with some forms to sign.  I have not received the contract yet but hopefully I will receive it soon and I am enthusiastic about the contributions I can make to the audit team.",0.22235729,0.7763231,0.0013196276

Applied online and got an email that I would have a phone interview in a month (and this was already a month after I'd applied).  After interview I heard back within a few weeks.  The whole process took about 3 months. They looked at my college classes to make sure that I was properly prepared for this type of interview.  Before the interview I was given a take home assignment to complete that would be discussed in addition to the interview.  The assignment was a little confusing but I managed to complete it almost entirely correctly and they were impressed that I was able to figure it out.  During the interview they asked about my past experience and I if I already knew about the computer programs that would be used during the internship.  Overall they were very nice and the interview was pretty straight forward.,0.0025262702,0.9965054,0.0009684151

I applied online for an advertised vacancy. They were quite quick at advising me of reaching the shortlist which is unusual for the UN. Most of the HR processes were surprisingly quick.  First I had to do a language test in a WFP official language other than English. Or you have to provide evidence of some kind of certification of your language level. I had no such certification so I signed up for a test.   Little information about the test was provided beforehand. Basically though an external firm was given my phone number and a time to call which had been agreed with me.  They called almost an hour late however. The test was conducted purely over the phone so it could only focus on listening and speaking ability  the former particularly not being a strong point for me. The tester would ask a question and you would respond to it. Many of the questions were hypothetical (what would you do if you were outside and it started raining and you had no umbrella? how would you describe the sea to someone who was blind?) and others practical (what will you be doing in 10 years? what did you do on the weekend?). The idea is to make you use various pieces of grammar (conditional future etc) and also to test if you understand the questions. The language test lasted probably around 20 minutes.  I struggled a fair bit but the level required obviously depends on the job and the job I was going for probably did not require a high level. I am at about B1 level in this language and managed to get to the interview stage.  I then was invited to interview in person in Rome at their HQ with the option of a phone interview instead if I preferred. I went to Rome. I organised the transport and hotel myself but I was later reimbursed (keep your receipts!).  There were 3 people in the interview  pretty standard in the UN system. The interview started 510 minutes late although one of the panel members turned up only after another 10 minutes or so.  I got the impression that the panel members were not serious and that this was not an open recruitment exercise. Two of them constantly checked their Blackberries during the interview with one even writing up an email (presumably) during it. This is annoying enough in a meeting but during an interview it was insulting and lacking in professionalism.  The rest of it went OK taking about 4550 minutes consisting of Q&A from both sides. There were no especially tricky questions but I got the clear impression there was a hole in my CV that meant I would not get the job. I assume that HR must have done the shortlisting rather than panel members.  My overall impression was poor due to the Blackberry checking. I was left with a sour taste in my mouth regarding the organisation.  As a final sign of this the position was then readvertised on the internet without the organisation even having sent me any feedback on my interview. I guess that acts as the rejection email in their eyes!,0.9977125,0.0021325066,0.00015496495
