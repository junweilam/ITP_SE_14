Director General Jan Beagle made her top priority the reform of the broken and corrupt HR system when she came in 2 years ago.

I've worked for IDLO for more than 4 years in various functions. The organisation is OK as a start within the international development sector. However if you do get other choices go for something else. Many complain that the organisation is toxic and not rewarding people that deserve to be. From what I have seen I can agree with this in part. Don't expect to be appreciated or respected for the extra efforts and ideas that you will want to bring onboard and implement in your daily workload. It will not be the type of organisation that you would like to serve on a long term or develop a career within. Most are leaving with the first better occasion that they get. So if you plan or ended up working for IDLO (as you have no other better choice) do yourself a favour and keep looking for some other opportunities. Don't get to comfy or devoted to the organisation or your department. The management is very poor thinking only about the internal impact to themselves and this module is replicated on all levels. In fact most of the leadership likes to portrait results obtained by their teams as their own ideas forgetting to recognise the hard efforts and great expertise of actual people that worked on those. The organisation is trying to find new ways to growth and develop into a better development institution (regularly by copying bigger agencies and development entities) but failing to do so as there is to much inside bureaucracy and lack of commitment to own staff. It is unfortunate and shameful (as it could be different) but there is a total lack of communication between organisations' divisions management and a clear lack of stability regarding the future career growth and now support for personal career development.,0.9974833,0.0023399717,0.00017673132

For Staff: If you screw up they promote you out and away.  Very many highlevel people who should NOT be there (but they cannot be fired) so they continue to cause problems over and over again. For consultants: Staff get the credit/recognition benefits and job security  You do all the work and then have to apply for your job every 11 months. Projects are often underresourced so consultants need to do the work or two or more people and they burn you out. I saw very many Country Directors and other highlevel Staff who were clearly not up to the job but somehow they are protected by someone and manage to get reassigned to another post and make the same huge mistakes over and over again.   Office politics on steroids!   The stated core value of integrity is rare in the senior staff and you would be wise to tread very carefully document everything take no verbal instructions and watch your back!  They will through you under the bus to cover up their mistakes.,0.998798,0.0010524322,0.00014952551

Hiring and promotion not based on merit but personal connections .Funds given  from donors /government  are poorly managed and waisted.It is paradox how they promoting themselves that every dollar is worth to them to save people lives (through private donations also ) but than the funds given to agency are very poorly managed.Coming from private sector where funds are treated to invest smartly (every penny) i was shocked how agency is dealing poorly with it.HR rules are not applicable to everyone on the same level(such as someone can get international consultancy contract meaning they are paying to 2500 dollars per month  only for food and accommodation while the others will not get it although they have rights..depends on your supervisor willingness to confront HR and his/her powerful position to confront it of course). However not having align HR rules based on merit creates lot of mess and not nice atmosphere among colleagues morale is also down.Not family oriented organization who has a right to send you to non family duty staton with short notice no matter if you have family basically feeling of being married to organization and fulfill their duties first.lot of turnover of consultants since no stable contracts usually very short for few months without any benefits.Young consultants are not treated nicely and all glory is given to senior staff..,0.9988403,0.0010015678,0.0001581193

There are a lot of cons but the main one specially if you're coming from the private sector is to see so much mismanagement of funds overhead and waist. You will be choked and somewhat disgusted about it.  There are two types of people there: the ones that care and work hard to fulfill WFP's mission and the ones that are there for the benefits. If you're part of the first group the later will make your life a nightmare. The work enrichment is terrible. Example about how bad things are: the other they launch a campaign about 'respect'. If you're looking for some bureaucratic career where you sit in useless status meetings 80% of your day while making some money at the expense of beneficiaries this is the place for you. It is hard to adapt if you're coming from the private sector specially if you're coming from outside Italy.,0.99830234,0.0015527781,0.00014488798
