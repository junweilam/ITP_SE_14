However, the staff turnover is notably high within this team due to insufficient pay for the workload which offers little incentive to stay, or affects one's sustainable ability to stay, despite the (of course) rewarding experience of directly assisting and advocating for people who are accessing these services. The CSA role is hard work and the remuneration does not reflect this. Big burn-out energy. \r\n\r\n+ The office environment is fairly trans/gender diverse friendly; management go to a fair amount of effort to normalise the use of correct pronouns which is refreshing in a professional context. However, there is so much work to be done in terms of ensuring the services themselves are trans/gender diverse conscious. Specific individuals work tirelessly to educate others within the organisation and encourage others to use more inclusive language on our website, social media and when engaging with patients directly, but it hasn't caught on. This organisation has great potential to be more inclusive (for example, introducing streamlined care for LGBTQIA+ people and affiliated services), but The Executive team who have the ability to make changes are lagging in this regard. Add some resources on our website, change the language and acknowledge their existence and relevance within this sector. It's not that hard, and there have been enough conversations and suggestions made internally. I suggest you develop positions/a specific team of LGBTQIA+ identifying people to help implement these changes. As the largest abortion provider/sexual/reproductive health organisation in the country your hesitance to step away from women-centric rhetoric is sad, frustrating and outdated. Learn from Family Planning and 1800 My Options. \r\n\r\n+ The Financial Support team have worked so hard to develop various financial support pathways to assist people who are not able to comfortably afford services. I am so proud of and impressed by the amount of effort that specific individuals have put into creating these pathways and the acknowledgement that if a patient can't pay we must prioritise their right to access services regardless.", "cons": "+ Despite fronting as a NFP, this organisation is revenue driven and benefits monetarily as a private clinic, resulting in a questionable industrial complex (though it is understood that profits made contribute to the company's philanthropy sector MSI). CSAs are managed via KPIs (which are unfairly determined as they calculate how many total calls result in bookings, including enquiry and non-booking related calls) which is ethically questionable within this sector - ESPECIALLY considering Marie Stopes have put forward a White Paper on reproductive coercion. CSAs are tirelessly encouraged to ensure a patient finalises a booking when they first make contact - emphasising value for revenue over providing patients with unbiased options and information. Endless suggestions from CSAs have been made to remove KPIs, but concerns are always dismissed, and we are advised they are essential in tracking the organisation's progress. \r\n\r\n+ CSAs complete compulsory training at the beginning of employment to learn a large network of processes and responsibilities akin to the role. This huge breadth of information and knowledge is fantastic to learn, and processes are often changing and updating, but there are limited ongoing learning opportunities from there other than extra operational duties. While the role itself is a great learning experience, it would be great if the organisation included opportunities for external learning, such as suicide prevention training and trauma-informed care (which seems quintessential for us as frontline workers but has never been explored), or other sexual/reproductive health courses. There are many passionate people who are drawn to the role due to the nature of the sector, but the position itself doesn't lend much room for expansion, specialisation or qualification. The role is better suited to people who like working pragmatically within a strict structure, as closely adhering to their processes is a must. If you are particularly passionate about and engaged with intersectional, inclusive sexual/reproductive health rights, this role acts as a double edged sword - on the one hand you have a great opportunity to engage with patients, however seeing where improvements can be made and wanting to advocate for progressive changes will not work in your favour... Management will push you out. They want employees who can stick to the basics of the role, maintain targets and keep the revenue rolling in.\r\n\r\n+ There is a lot of emphasis placed on CSAs to maintain their mental health and work/life balance (particularly as they are responsible for first contact patient intake). This expectation is unrealistic due to limited internal resources, disproportionate pay to workload and KPI management tactics. The team itself are extremely emotionally supportive, but the organisation should go to MUCH more effort to offer more varied mental health support pathways to take the pressure off interpersonal relationships. Many CSAs have noted the EAP provider to be insufficient, and many find monthly one on one catch ups with management to be unhelpful and counterproductive as they are framed too heavily around \"performance\" analysis - contributing to toxic corporate call centre culture."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Marie Stopes Australia provides fantastic opportunities to deliver strong social outcomes.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Financial Controller in Melbourne", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There is a clear visionary strategic plan with the initiatives actively supported and demonstrated  by the Executive Team.

Personal friends of the CEO, Michelle Thompson, are hired for roles, while her staff favourites seem immune from any performance management for unprofessional conduct.  This can be seen from the high turnover of newer staff, but the longevity of preferred employees. \r\n\r\n- The organisation consistently hires incredibly competent and capable staff. The organisation's mission attracts people who are passionate. However these employees are micromanaged to the point where they have no real authority in their role. This also leads many staff to feel that their expertise, suggestions and work are not respected.\r\n\r\n- Concerns raised about serious mental health issues and staff burnout (which is not unexpected in what is obviously a very high stress industry) are routinely ignored. Often these concerns are dismissed as not existing at all. Management refuses to participate in any form of employee engagement surveying or other similar efforts that could determine staff satisfaction and wellbeing. \r\n\r\n- Michelle Thompson seems to have no ability to emotionally regulate and so staff are at the mercy of her constantly changing temperament. She regularly targets teams or individuals and conducts impromptu sessions of berating them in the middle of the open plan office. This does not improve staff morale. \r\n\r\n- COO receives no support from Michelle Thompson and often appears pressured into accomodating her demands. COO spends extensive hours in the office, while Michelle appears to arrive and depart at leisure, routinely disappearing for hours on end with no transparency as to any projects she is working. \r\n\r\n- Staff are rarely given updates as to what upper management are working on, which makes it difficult for them to be engaged in the journey or invested in the organisation's success. \r\n\r\n- Upper management often set unrealistic goals and targets, and then fail to provide the resources necessary to meet them. The overall attitude from Michelle Thompson is then that staff are not working hard enough to meet targets. These targets net Michelle a personal financial windfall, but staff receive no such benefits and often receive no acknowledgement for the long hours and high stress they invest in trying to meet these targets. \r\n\r\n- The organisation is NFP, so resources are limited, however the majority of staff are highly overworked and under-resourced for the roles they are given. It's not at all unusual for a staff member to leave and for their colleague to then be expected to work both roles without additional remuneration. Despite the lower staff salaries, no alternative incentives are offered, such as flexible working arrangements, additional annual leave, etc. \r\n\r\n- Upper management seems to be unaware that any of this is an issue, and regularly comment on the inability to retain quality staff. If they are aware of it, they refuse to acknowledge any of the above issues, and instead become hostile towards staff who express any dissatisfaction with the way the organisation is run."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Something special is going on there", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Nursing Unit Manager in Melbourne", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Enthusiastic and hands on leader who is values driven and is focused on the right staff for the right stuff.\nOpportunities to have your voice heard and ideas to be actioned\nRipe to innovate", "cons": "Nursing pay rates not on par with public and private EBA but congruent with fair work Australia Nurses Award"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Nurse", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Nurse in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good cause.
