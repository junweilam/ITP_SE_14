Good experience for CV.", "cons": "Staff are over worked and underpaid. My role was technically an EA role -they just pass it off as an administrator to pay less. Very low salaries for the hours and lots of expected over time. You put in so much effort into the role and its not appreciated. The manager can be arrogant, condescending and micromanages and you're constantly given negative feedback and feel like you cant do anything right - no matter how hard you work. Some of the staff can be quiet pretencious aswell."}]]
