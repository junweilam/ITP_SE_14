Especially if you take a chance on yourself or think outside of the box.  There are 2 populations of staff, the frontline staff (treated fairly poorly, generally an afterthought in decision making processes, no development opportunities, very little flexibility) and the bureaucracy (treated well, flexible working arrangements, development opportunities, paid better, respected for the job they do)  Divisions and areas are completely siloed.  Job and pay structure (classifications) are some of the most limited I have ever come across, which is having an impact on employment etc. it is impossible to move classifications and/or grades and once you reach the top of your very short grade, that is is for movement for you.
