Their focus is always solely on the clients (which is absolutely very important), however staff should be equally important and that is sadly not the case. Staff are treated as second class citizens, that are expendable. There are some pockets of the business where managers do an excellent job and treat their staff well.

I have never worked for an organisation that is so top-heavy, greedy and disingenuous. Their priority is billables with little focus on clinical outcomes or progress. In fact, I don\u2019t think anyone has ever asked me about the efficacy of the therapy I am providing. They will show you a lot of graphs to compare you to your peers. Even if you meet your billable hours in direct appointments, you will still have to account for why you didn\u2019t bill more for phone calls/emails or resource preparation. It\u2019s not enough just to meet your KPI, you have to do it with at least 2.5hrs in indirect/non-client facing time per week, or explain yourself in your \u201c1:1 catch-ups\u201d. You will be asked to keep spreadsheets to count the minutes until a client reaches the 15minute minimum to bill for \u201cliaison\u201d, even if this is spread across months. If you want to be a dollar sign on a spreadsheet then this is the place for you. They belittle their staff, induce anxiety, and have people going home in tears. There is blatant favouritism, scoffing about previous staff members in team meetings and rarely a smile or hello to be heard from management. Don\u2019t be fooled by the smoke and mirrors at interviews, despite all of the \u201cpersonality quizzes\u201d that they ask you to do, none of this will be utilised in how they manage you. The site that I work at has a very high turnover of staff. Last year there was about a 50% turnover with some new hires lasting only 3 months. Clients and their families are VERY unhappy about having to regularly change clinicians, with some reporting as many as 4 therapist changes in 12 months. Other clients who have attended regular therapy session for years, have recently been told they are \u201cno longer a priority\u201d as they don\u2019t have cerebral palsy despite being long-term, hardworking clients that CPA accepted when NDIS rolled out. Career progression can be challenging and I have been told by others that despite completing the long and arduous re-grade process, your manager can simply say no, even if you meet all of the necessary criteria. New graduates have reported to me that they feel unsupported and inadequately trained to take on clients with complex disabilities. I have come from working in NSW Health and am leaving to return to the same. I had been excited about the opportunity to work at CPA but it has honestly been a very disheartening experience and I don\u2019t recommend it."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor Management", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Therapy in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Access to experienced allied health team", "cons": "-Poor culture - lots of gossip, especially among admin staff and middle managers \r\n-Unachievable KPIS\r\n-Minimal opportunities for career progression or re-grading \r\n-Impossible to have annual leave approved - they prefer to pay out your leave once you move on as they make more money having you work\r\n-Low hourly rates and salary \r\n-Inflexible hours \r\n-No control over your caseload or diary - admin do this and they'll give you huge days without breaks so they can meet their 'booking' KPIs\r\n-Management are bullies and the customers are always right and they'll promise to any kind of service, even if CPA doesn't have the resources to deliver \r\n-No choice to specialise - you'll have to see all kinds of random referrals which makes planning hard \r\n-Lots of driving to appointments - admin don't take care when booking your calendar \r\n-Very clique, management will hassle you about KPIs every week, they won't offer solutions to help you raise them expect for telling you that you need to book more\r\n-High turn-over - when I left my role was filled, and the person left a few months after\r\n-Too many people working in non-clinical roles which means that clinical (billing) therapy staff have to pull the weight and cover the salaries of so many others without themselves reaping any benefit"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good money", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Feb 2022", "job_title": "House Manager in Hornsby", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay with salary sacrifice option", "cons": "On call every 5 weeks which means 24/7 availability for a week"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "100% Would Recommend", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Disability Support Worker in Newcastle", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Competitive Rates\r\n- New equipment and technology \r\n- Extensive Training and Onboarding\r\n- Great employee health benefits", "cons": "Expected to work all types of shifts (day, afternoon, overnight) but this is no different to most disability companies"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best disability organisation I've worked for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "31 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Disability Support Worker in Newcastle", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great training opportunities, good management, clients are well taken care of and staff are given all the resources and equipment to do the job well and safely.", "cons": "Have not found any yet"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best Workplace!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Business Partner Talent Acquisition in Frenchs Forest", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have been with CPA for about a year and a half now and it has been amazing so far.
