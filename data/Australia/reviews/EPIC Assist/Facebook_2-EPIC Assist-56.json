Management have an unrealistic view on what they expect from staff however give no support when asked. HR is one of the rudest people to deal with, whenever there are issues they do not listen and only go off paperwork which most of the time it is forged.  Management use intimidation not only with staff but also with client's to get them to do job trials and will suspend their payments for any reason if it was justifiable. \r\n\r\nEpic's Behavior's- these are implemented by management however management do not follow these but enforce staff to adhere to these.  \r\n\r\nBottom line staff have little to no communication with Senior Leadership Team members yet they are the only staff that can give references when staff would like to leave. They do not base it off the work that you do and most of the Senior Leadership Team members do not know staff names or little about how the staff member works in a team etc. which would be beneficial for a new employer to know. The reference that they would provide is based of statistics which in the past have proved inconsistent with the database they use. \r\n\r\nThe client's that we service struggle with change yet whenever this feedback has been passed onto management they brush it under the carpet and advise they need to get use to change- while this has some sense to it when client's have 4 consultant changes in 4 months this is beyond the need for them to adapt to change. This feedback was not taken on board and clients are suffering the constant change of consultant and confusion on who their consultant is. \r\n\r\nOne of the main disappointments with working for this company was when female staff would bring to management being uncomfortable in an office due to a male client coming in and being verbally abusive as well as punching the office walls that management has not done anything to assist in making sure that females feel comfortable in this site- yet they are left to cover this site by themselves."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sinking ship!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Sept 2019", "job_title": "Employment Consultant in Brisbane", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have made some wonderful friends through my 4 years at this company.\r\nI realized my professional and personal strengths can't be broken by this company!", "cons": "Lowest paying DES in the industry.

Underhanded processes so that claims were able to be taken. The poor customers have more than 5 changes or so per year on EC caseloads - the customers scream for consistency and great customer service but upper management continually change staff's roles/sites and the staff are forever disconnecting from strong customer relationships they've built and apologizing to unhappy customers. \r\n\r\nThere is a narcissism in the air at times, a lot of trumpets being blurted instead of head down bum up hard work being done. Offices lack professionalism boundaries by managers and staff sometimes followed suit. This is a sinking ship in my opinion JUMP, don't come aboard!\r\n\r\nSenior Leadership are the only references available. Most staff members have never met one!

People are intimidated and ruled with an iron fist. Every conversation from management comes back to getting people into employment, 'placements'. Management will continually remind staff if they don't meet their placement targets, they'll lose their jobs. If you don't work 150% you'll lose your job. If you're late because you had a family emergency, that's right, you'll lose your job. \r\n\r\nThis means you'll be working in fear for your job, your financial security and your mental wellbeing.

A good manager is one who leads their team by example, not one who sits back and micromanages. \r\n\r\nPeople join this company to help people with disability get sustainable employment.
