Prepare yourself to work to the bone, living your life under the constant pressure of 6-month rolling contracts, and the fine print at the bottom of the contract reminding you that you are dispensable by politely that \"subject to funding\". I've been a professional in the human services for over 19 years, but I left work every day bitter, angry, and often after 8pm in tears of exhaustion and frustration. I have framed the two emails that I got in 14 months saying \"thank you\" as if it were a sighting of a UFO. I worked night after night and on weekends which management was aware of given the emails after 7 or 10 pm, and waking up to a work/life balance one from management in the morning. Picture a place were entire departments resign en masse, and staff of diverse backgrounds making complaint after complaint about racist behaviour and words only to receive the \"insufficient evidence\" quasi-automated response. Further, picture the same place where even temp staff refuse to work at, and those who do lasted a week at best. I am yet to converse with a fellow colleague who resigned without emotional scarring, a place where meeting your targets was to your own detriment, as it was construed as you are cruising, and watch in horror as it doubles, and triples, and soon after you are cordially invited to a Performance Management meeting asking why. No job has ever been harder since, for which I bear gratitude, but the bitterness and lashing out that my resignation elicited, left a sour taste in my mouth, chronic back pain from the worse than Ikea chairs and desks, and the loss of confidence and self-esteem that followed me to my new role akin to PTSD. CLO-nistan. I miss my colleagues every day, and leaving there was like leaving prison after forming life long bonds with your fellow inmates."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst company to work for", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Thebarton", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There really aren\u2019t any pros to this company", "cons": "Employed for a particular role that never eventuated so was stuck working a role that I was not employed for \u2018while waiting for the project to start\u2019 the project never started, office politics, not a \u2018team\u2019 environment, everyone is out to blame others and get other people into trouble (I observed other staff purposely setting up other staff to get disciplined), the money is poor, communication with the company is very poor and critical information is shared via email when a phone call would be more appropriate, very very low standards of care for clients, very poor inductions for staff and high expectations for new workers that aren\u2019t familiar with the dozens of forms which vary greatly between clients.
