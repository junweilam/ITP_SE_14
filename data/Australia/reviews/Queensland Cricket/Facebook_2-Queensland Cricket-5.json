The perception is that staff aren't working hard but they are, often on weekends and evenings when he's finished for the day. The Board is completely out of touch and never even talks to employees when they are in the office. The Board and management are full of egos, politics and self-interested people. Cricket Australia have got better to work with but are still very bureaucratic and sometimes out of touch with what happens in the states."}]]
