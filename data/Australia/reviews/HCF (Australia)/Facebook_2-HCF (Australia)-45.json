The favourites got decent pay increases (>10%) whilst the rest of us had to make do with 2% or less (some of us got none), and being told there was no budget for higher increases which was rubbish. The pay increases and rewards do not seem to be based upon contribution and what has been delivered, but on how much one is a favourite of the senior manager and/or Chief. Senior managers have also lied about not giving pay increases where it is warranted, i.e. where the pay is below market, and senior managers have lied about increasing pay to match the market when previously they have said they will.\r\n\r\nThere are some people who are \"protected species\", where they can make multiple mistakes and/or stuff ups (some which are major, e.g. high staff turnover in their team or poor decisions which destroy value and delay key projects) and there is no repercussions for them (and if they are a favourite of the Chief they get a very good pay increase too !!), however for the rest of us, one small mistake (e.g. missing a space in front of a word in a document) and we are tagged as poor performers for the rest of the year. Also, the non-favourites of the senior managers and Chiefs (which is the majority of us) are purposely setup to fail with unrealistic KPIs and targets, and the favourites of senior management seem to be able to stay on in the job no matter how much they stuff up, make mistakes or just have a poor attitude towards completing work \u2013 seems like people are kept in jobs not based on their competency but on how well they get along with senior management.\r\n\r\nMicromanagement of employees, where everyone seems to be under some form of monitoring and our start/end times, lunch breaks, coffee breaks are always commented on whenever they run slightly longer, with no consideration of circumstances (e.g. employee may have taken a slightly longer lunch break, however they stayed till 7pm the same day). Snide comments are also made when anyone leaves at 5pm, even though the employee may have come in extra early or have forgone their lunch break.\r\n\r\nEmployees are rated by whether they are present at their desk, rather than their output, and it does not matter when someone who is in the office from 9 \u2013 5 delivers more work and is more productive than someone who is in the office for 12 hours.\r\n\r\nWork from home is frowned upon by managers and actively discouraged. Managers have commented that \"everyone should be in the office as our job requires us to\", \"working from home is only allowed for those of a senior manager rank and above\" and \"if you are working from home, there is no one to monitor what you do\".\r\n\r\nA number of people managers are quite arrogant, where they are dismissive and outwardly denigrate views of their subordinates that are not in line with their own. They have an attitude of \u201cI\u2019m a manager, I know best\u201d towards their subordinates, and would refuse to even explain the underlying reasons for a decision being made, or a request for work to be done. Also, it seems like a lot of work is being done which is useless and fluffy and serves no purpose other than to boost the ego of the relevant Heads Of or Chief.\r\n\r\nPeople managers who just play politics and are not interested in getting the work done. They will withhold information (on purpose), stonewall and come up with excuses to not help or assist people, just so they can advance their own agenda and make themselves \u201clook good\u201d to senior management.\r\n\r\nPeople managers who do not give clear instructions on how to get a task done (or none at all), and when asked about how to do it, are told to \u201cuse your brain and work it out\u201d. And the worse thing is when the task is handed over to be reviewed, am told that \u201cthe quality is below par of what I expected\u201d when expectations was not set from the start, and poor instruction quality was provided.\r\n\r\nPeople managers who change up the deadlines of a task and add more complexity to it (i.e. scope creep), as they do not know how to manage expectations of other stakeholders and they let their direct reports bear the brunt of their inability to say no. This creates a lot of stress and people are becoming annoyed/snappy/antagonistic towards one another because of all this stress.\r\n\r\nPeople managers who cannot be trusted in anyway at all \u2013 trusted to have your back, trusted to do the things they promised, trusted to be honest and above all, trusted to have empathy in dealing with their direct reports which they do not have any at all.\r\n\r\nPeople managers are of the type where they are \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d. \r\n\r\nPeople managers who provide vague feedback, i.e. \u201cI think you need to improve on your time management skills\u201d, but when pressed for details they do not seem to be able, or are unwilling to provide them, as was told \u201cyou need to work this out yourself\u201d. And lo and behold when it came to performance review time, got marked down will be told \u201cyou didn\u2019t improve on this\u201d when no feedback was given nor was there any coaching offered to improve. It appears to be that people managers are looking for excuses to not give pay rises to deserving staff, as achievements and other completed projects seemed to be overlooked when assessing performance, and only negative feedback is provided, and nothing positive is ever mentioned.\r\n\r\nA lot of people managers also seem unable to take on feedback as well. An example is where they have made a mistake and it is pointed out, they get very defensive about it, which is hypocritical in the extreme as they delight in pointing out mistakes their own direct reports make (no matter how small), and to use that in marking them down in their annual review.\r\n\r\nJobs are being filled with those that the manager has worked with previously (either in prior firms or currently in HCF), and not advertised either internally or externally\r\n\r\nPersonal development is not based on what the employee wants, but just solely on what the manager wants which most of the time is incongruent with the employee\u2019s aspirations. This means that the employee ends up frustrated and angry as the manager designs processes to develop them in areas that they either have no interest in or have work piled on them that they do not have the capability to handle (and which the manager thinks is a development opportunity). In addition to this, managers expect employees to train themselves in their own time, with no support provided (both from a financial and time perspective).\r\n\r\nWithholding of training opportunities, where again the favourites of the team are allowed, and provided the opportunity to, attend external events and training sessions that helps develop their skills, whilst the rest of us are excluded from it and are only aware of these events and training sessions when those that have went send out an email outlining what they learned from it.\r\n\r\nThere is no point in sending out emails saying that HCF supports mental wellbeing and you need to take time to look after your own mental health along with highlighting how much they donate to causes that champion it, when a lot of people managers are the direct contributors to poor mental health in the workplace through their management practices. Really, the best way to improve mental health is to actually improve the quality of people managers, and to reassess how people managers are promoted to that position from within the organisation. In fact, some of these people managers should be fired as they are bullies and psychopaths, but they are kept on as senior management seems to turn a blind eye towards their bullying ways as these bullies happen to be \u201cprotected species\u201d."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not Easy for Starter", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jun 2019", "job_title": "Customer Service Agent in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "half price of HCF insurance product, 2weeks training was great in the Syd CBD office blocks, uniform provided upon on arrival", "cons": "complex system to use, transition period , lack of training from senior or manager, push for sale, if you don't get enough sales you will get kick out soon"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Toxic Work Environ,ent", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "7 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Money, you also get a shift allowance for working after 5pm - overtime is paid as well", "cons": "Toxic work environment, back stabbing between department.. unsupported management.. poor and unrelevant training"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jan 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Sydney", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great flexible work options.
