NYFA (Australia) recently had a management change that went from bad to worse. They say they care about their teachers and students, but their actions reveal something else. They are a business who only seem to care about screwing the $$ out of people. Not once did I receive a peer review and our pay went backwards, despite being told the opposite in the last few weeks. There are serious interpersonal flaws in the management positions. They just don't seem to care about anything other than getting students in, taking their dollars, and taking advantage of the educators on the front line. Toxic is an understatement."}], []]
