The big brother environment, including timed 30 minute lunch breaks, suffocates even the brightest of spirits and sends the most enthusiastic staff member into a lengthy bouts of depression. The young bright sparks are trampled on by outrageous levels of insecurity of senior management and even the suggestion of finishing early on Christmas Eve was trampled by the CEO. The awful work environment is only compounded by the very difficult subject matter upon which the organisation is based on. The majority of staff have lost compassion and speak of the people they're helping with disdain. Going through the motions seems to be a prerequisite of successful employment here, followed closely second by sleeping with your boss to obtain a position (no pun intended) of leadership whilst maintain a complete and utter lack of competence in your profession. \r\n\r\nThe general tone? Negative, soul destroying, as uttered by current and past employees alike. Those that are still there only remain because of little choice in a challenging work environment. Do yourself a favour. SYC? Need not apply."}]]
