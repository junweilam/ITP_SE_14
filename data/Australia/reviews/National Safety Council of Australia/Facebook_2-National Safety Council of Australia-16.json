Needs to stop training safety and train staff in mental health and suicide prevention.", "cons": "After Wesfarmers acquired the NSCA there were mass unexplained redundancies and resignations. Internal fighting and politics, cases of bullying and harassment that was covered up to avoid FWA involvement. It is an embarrassment for the National Safety Council of Australia to be involved in bullying and discrimination and employee cases of mental illness. So much for advocating and training safe workplaces."}]]
