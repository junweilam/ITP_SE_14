While there are a few positives such as market salary, rostered days off, and hybrid working, they are overshadowed by a plethora of challenges that plague this organisation.", "cons": "Challenges Faced: Siloed Teams: It's astonishing how disconnected the various teams are within this company. The left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing, leading to a frustrating lack of collaboration and coordination. This silo mentality hampers progress and creates unnecessary hurdles at every turn. Poor Planning and Communication at the Senior Management Level: The senior management fail miserably in their duties. Their inability to plan effectively and communicate clearly is mind-boggling. This lack of direction and guidance trickles down to every level of the organisation, resulting in confusion, wasted time, and missed opportunities. Lack of Accountability and Support from Senior Management: One would expect senior management to be pillars of support and accountability. Unfortunately, that is not the case here. Instead, they shirk their responsibilities and conveniently shift the blame onto others down the chain. Their lack of support leaves employees feeling abandoned and disheartened. Overworked and Stressed Workforce: The workload is unrelenting and overwhelming. Employees are constantly pushed to their limits, resulting in extreme stress and burnout. It is no wonder that talented individuals eventually leave, disillusioned and exhausted by the constant demands placed upon them. Neglected ICT/Finance Systems: The company's refusal to invest in modern ICT and finance systems is a major hindrance. Outdated and inefficient systems only add to the workload, creating unnecessary manual tasks and reducing productivity. The lack of investment in this crucial area is baffling and counterproductive. Senior Managers Lost in relentless Meetings: Senior managers seem to spend more time in constant overlong meetings than actually taking action. Endless discussions without concrete outcomes further exacerbate the issues faced by the organisation. This lack of action is a clear indication of their ineffectiveness and detachment from reality. Lack of Performance Reviews and Team Engagement: The absence of performance reviews is indicative of a management team that lacks the courage to confront issues head-on. They are uncomfortable engaging with their teams and addressing problems constructively. This avoidance only perpetuates existing problems and stifles growth. Blatant Deflection of Responsibility: Rather than taking responsibility for their actions or decisions, management prefers to pass the buck down the chain. This behaviour not only undermines trust and morale but also hinders progress and resolution of pressing issues. Repeated \"Right-Sizing\": The company's habit of conducting \"right-sizing\" exercises is both disruptive and demoralising. Permanent staff members are either made redundant or forced to reapply for lesser-paid positions. This constant instability and uncertainty breed a toxic work environment. Lack of Actionable Vision and Strategy: Despite the lip service paid to the importance of vision and strategy, senior management fails to translate these buzzwords into actionable plans. The lack of investment in critical areas, coupled with the absence of a clear direction, hampers growth and stifles innovation."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Wouldn\u2019t Recommend", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "26 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Disability Support Worker in Perth, Western Australia", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Clients and some good staff", "cons": "Lots of organisational change. lots of emails but not much face to face communication and engagement.
