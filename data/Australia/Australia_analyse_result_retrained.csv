Staff are over worked and underpaid. My role was technically an EA role they just pass it off as an administrator to pay less. Very low salaries for the hours and lots of expected over time. You put in so much effort into the role and its not appreciated. The manager can be arrogant condescending and micromanages and you're constantly given negative feedback and feel like you cant do anything right  no matter how hard you work.

Bullying was wellknown to be happening but HR and senior management didn't seem to want to deal with it  or even admit it was happening. No support given to victims. This led to massive staff churn in certain roles which is a huge waste of money and resources in a charity that relies on donations from members of the public.

Absolutely no career progression. No diversity action. Leadership mentality is to promote the mirror image of themselves it is endemic. Anyone who presents a different point of view is stuck where they are forever. Dodgy hiring and promotion practices especially internally. I work in an area that a person just magically one day turned into the 2IC. No job ad. No interviews. No one else given the chance even though there are at least two others who are suitably qualified and capable.  Bullying practices are fairly common depending on where you are. Especially if you take a chance on yourself or think outside of the box.  There are 2 populations of staff the frontline staff (treated fairly poorly generally an afterthought in decision making processes no development opportunities very little flexibility) and the bureaucracy (treated well flexible working arrangements development opportunities paid better respected for the job they do)  Divisions and areas are completely siloed.  Job and pay structure (classifications) are some of the most limited I have ever come across which is having an impact on employment etc. it is impossible to move classifications and/or grades and once you reach the top of your very short grade that is is for movement for you.  The culture is trying to be better the shadow culture doesn’t reflect that yet and at the rate it is going it will be many years before tangible change happens.,0.99868816,0.0011578192,0.00015410426

"Lack of integrity empathy transparency respect. They don't care for their staff or the donors that give them the money.  This organisation decided to make over half their employees redundant even though there was no financial reason behind it. They said it was due to losses from the pandemic but those in finance advised they using that as an excuse. The way they dragged on the redundancy threat to staff for months without clear direction was cruel having staff panicking about the security in their roles. The message from the interim CEO was cold and uncaring ""everyone is replaceable and noone is safe"". The People and Culture team were disgusting throughout the process and didn't care what this meant to individuals that were about to lose their only source of income with one senior P&C person 'excited about the redundancies because it was giving her variety in her role'. This is the second round of this type of thing happening in 3 years and no change in the way they delivered it. They weren't transparent about their decisions. On top of that this is an organisation that allows bullying and disgraceful behaviour to be carried on at all levels. The only teams that seemed to not have horrible people leaders were the jump rope for heart team the bequest department and the walking team unfortunately those teams were decimated and lost too many good members. Sticking around after the redundancies was a poor decision things went from bad to worse with terrible new leaders put in place that were more wanting to make a name for themselves and not trying to get stability and trust back.",0.99837375,0.0014367485,0.00018952688

If you are looking for a caring supportive and empathetic employer you are looking in the wrong place!  In the last year the organisation has undergone a lot of changes due to financial difficulties due in part to the pandemic we have just been through. This resulted in the forced redundancies of around half the staff from a workforce of around 260 staff to around 130.   With the redundancies came resignations from senior management.  New management were hired and this is where things started to go wrong.  A new manager went rogue trying to make a name for themselves. Their demeanour resulted in the resignation of the CIO.  An interim CIO was hired by the same manager and has done nothing since joining the organisation but cause further problems within the wider IT team ultimately resulting in further resignations.  Management then decided to implement a vaccination mandate policy for all offices Australia wide.  The new policy made it mandatory to be triple vaccinated despite most states in Australia scrapping it mandates and the state with the strictest of all mandates only mandating for two vaccinations.  Staff were surveyed about the proposed new policy but those who opposed it were ignored and shunned by the organisation especially by those from P&C. They did not care.  In fact the only thing that they seemed to care about was addressing staff by their proper pronouns!

The Institute is a vibrant and energetic place to work with great opportunity for those who have initiative to grab it.  I have worked in a multitude of different roles over 10  years with AIF and once my performance was proven and trust built workplace flexibility became the most valued perk for me as I became a working mum.      AIF is a national company that uses latest technology to break down barriers for remote staff to ensure we stay connected and engaged.  Over the years I have seen staff leave and return which truly is a testament to the working experience at the AIF.  We play hard but have fun along the way.,0.0005925649,0.00112616,0.99828124

Senior executive management needs to change. Most of the GM’s have been there for over 2030 years. They are stale and not commercially savvy. There is no awareness (or they choose to ignore it) as to just how unhappy staff are across all role types across the organisation. Staff are not empowered valued or respected. Their focus is always solely on the clients (which is absolutely very important) however staff should be equally important and that is sadly not the case. Staff are treated as second class citizens that are expendable. There are some pockets of the business where managers do an excellent job and treat their staff well. Unfortunately though those good managers are leaving because of the lack of strong leadership at the exec level so it is now a very disheartened and poor culture. Hence why I chose to leave. I would not consider working here unless you see there has been changes at the executive level.,0.9970541,0.0026977784,0.00024813207

Since the change of management in recent years many staff suffered from psychopathic behaviour and consequently many have left the organisation or this day centre (which is not in the Northern Beaches or Western Sydney). Bullying and power trips were not unusual. They do not seem to be capable of managing older staff and prefer younger ones who are easier to manage. When staff bring up serious allegations to senior management they only give you templated replies and nothing changes.,0.99822754,0.0016260926,0.00014640384

The therapists are brilliant. They are all very hardworking dedicated and genuine people who work tirelessly for their clients. The reception team also put their whole hearts into this job and welcome clients with warmth and humour. The clinical educators are knowledgeable and easy to learn from.

The management is enormously disappointing for a charity. I have never worked for an organisation that is so topheavy greedy and disingenuous. Their priority is billables with little focus on clinical outcomes or progress. In fact I don’t think anyone has ever asked me about the efficacy of the therapy I am providing. They will show you a lot of graphs to compare you to your peers. Even if you meet your billable hours in direct appointments you will still have to account for why you didn’t bill more for phone calls/emails or resource preparation. It’s not enough just to meet your KPI you have to do it with at least 2.5hrs in indirect/nonclient facing time per week or explain yourself in your “1:1 catchups”. You will be asked to keep spreadsheets to count the minutes until a client reaches the 15minute minimum to bill for “liaison” even if this is spread across months. If you want to be a dollar sign on a spreadsheet then this is the place for you. They belittle their staff induce anxiety and have people going home in tears. There is blatant favouritism scoffing about previous staff members in team meetings and rarely a smile or hello to be heard from management. Don’t be fooled by the smoke and mirrors at interviews despite all of the “personality quizzes” that they ask you to do none of this will be utilised in how they manage you. The site that I work at has a very high turnover of staff. Last year there was about a 50% turnover with some new hires lasting only 3 months. Clients and their families are VERY unhappy about having to regularly change clinicians with some reporting as many as 4 therapist changes in 12 months. Other clients who have attended regular therapy session for years have recently been told they are “no longer a priority” as they don’t have cerebral palsy despite being longterm hardworking clients that CPA accepted when NDIS rolled out. Career progression can be challenging and I have been told by others that despite completing the long and arduous regrade process your manager can simply say no even if you meet all of the necessary criteria. New graduates have reported to me that they feel unsupported and inadequately trained to take on clients with complex disabilities. I have come from working in NSW Health and am leaving to return to the same. I had been excited about the opportunity to work at CPA but it has honestly been a very disheartening experience and I don’t recommend it.,0.998487,0.0013312283,0.0001817718

This company groups multiple Kids (up to 4) with severe behaviour in the same house. Instead of every kid having a separate house and being nurtured they would rather have our building and one roster of workers for multiple kids and have those kids be impacted by others in the house and turn out for the worse. This company constantly talks about self care but if you ever try to ask for time off and reduce your hours you will have to go through hell with management. The amount of funding this company gets from the qld government but can't even afford a Christmas party for their staff along with literally doing everything to save money despite being a non got profit is extremely disheartening.. dont ever expect that executive management or the ceo will ever come to your work place as your nothing to them and they don't have time for your place. There are smaller companies out there that put the kids first and have houses for each kid where the results and behaviour are alot better and have better outcomes.

This organisation is tragically ill equipped to be responsible to be an employer of people! The entire management team are so ego driven and self absorbed. They have surrounded themselves with people who will always agree they reward bullying and victim blaming. They are irresponsible with the most precious asset they have being their staff. The culture is so toxic and the “senior managers” know that it is that way but just ignore the blatant evidence. Managers in positions that just do not give a care for children and young! Speaking up only gets you targeted!!! Complaints not responded or easily dismissed as “disgruntled staff!! There is no point applying for the CEO position that is already decided!!!

"While I solemnly declare the above is true is correct the organisation has only survived this long by immovable professional ethics and integrity of its staff forcing them to work in conditions with pay noncommensurate with experience even if you were more qualified than your manager. Prepare yourself to work to the bone living your life under the constant pressure of 6month rolling contracts and the fine print at the bottom of the contract reminding you that you are dispensable by politely that ""subject to funding"". I've been a professional in the human services for over 19 years but I left work every day bitter angry and often after 8pm in tears of exhaustion and frustration. I have framed the two emails that I got in 14 months saying ""thank you"" as if it were a sighting of a UFO. I worked night after night and on weekends which management was aware of given the emails after 7 or 10 pm and waking up to a work/life balance one from management in the morning. Picture a place were entire departments resign en masse and staff of diverse backgrounds making complaint after complaint about racist behaviour and words only to receive the ""insufficient evidence"" quasiautomated response. Further picture the same place where even temp staff refuse to work at and those who do lasted a week at best. I am yet to converse with a fellow colleague who resigned without emotional scarring a place where meeting your targets was to your own detriment as it was construed as you are cruising and watch in horror as it doubles and triples and soon after you are cordially invited to a Performance Management meeting asking why. No job has ever been harder since for which I bear gratitude but the bitterness and lashing out that my resignation elicited left a sour taste in my mouth chronic back pain from the worse than Ikea chairs and desks and the loss of confidence and selfesteem that followed me to my new role akin to PTSD.

Not a support team management aren’t supportive would advise people not to work here it is so poorly run. You get very very little client info I worked with clients that had significant forensic mental health diagnoses and was only given their address and name no background information no behaviour information you get thrown in the deep end with no idea what you’re walking into which puts everyone at risk,0.9990657,0.0007825559,0.00015173975

When working for CLO it is made clear to support workers that you are a pawn they can move around to sites without consultation.   Unbelievably poor management and consultation procedures for staff that directly affect their lives income and family.    Are more focused on completing required NDIS paperwork/procedures than delivering person centred support.  Will continuously place casuals with clients that have anxiety over meeting new people or working with particular genders then permanent support workers are left to clean up the emotional mess.  Coordinators are stretched too thin and do not have adequate time for client related matters.  They often work well beyond their allocated hours without pay.  Training and professional development is poor. Training for a particular subject is a 23 hour affair read of a powerpoint by unqualified people to talk on each matter.   Professional development paperwork occurs just so they can tick a box saying it was done.

"Training provided is almost completely irrelevant to the actual role. Effective communication is limited despite the number of app notifications and emails. Quite often it is difficult to know what is going on or what you are expected to do. Occasionally lip service is paid to volunteers but you get the sense that there is no true respect or appreciation. You're not even referred to as a volunteer most of the time but as a ""pro bono employee"" which actually sums it up quite nicely  you are seen as an unpaid worker and treated as such. Letter of engagement says that""you will not have reasonably predictable or regular hours of work and may be required to work at any time of the week including late nights weekends and public holidays to suit the Employer's operational requirements upon negotiation."" Gives you a pretty good idea of how things stand. Organisations can virtue signal as much as they want but that doesn't mean they will actually treat people well. My advice would be to keep your head down get some experience and then leave as soon as you can. The turnover and vacancy rate is high for a reason.

Culture from the top is poor everyone talks about playing above the line on one hand while playing below the line on the other. Those who are underhanded continue to be recognised for their 'good work' while stonewalling others. Uniforms are to be worn and head office dictate rules and regulations and motivate with fear. There is not a lot of support for the staff in the field to help you fulfill your role with only a few exceptions that are helpful at head office. Flexible working hours  requests to meet the demands of my family life were refused.  Pay isnt great company cars are given but you have to pay for the privilege.,0.9983101,0.0013946245,0.000295301
One of the main benefits of working with this company is working with likeminded people to help our client's reach their goals.,0.00019211408,0.00025356523,0.99955434
Management offers no actual support to issues or assists with any solutions that are needed uses performance management as a tool to get rid of staff instead of giving them tools to help improve their performance Epic's policies are monthly one on ones with managers however these meetings hardly occur and when they do it is more management telling rather than listening to the staff. Management have an unrealistic view on what they expect from staff however give no support when asked. HR is one of the rudest people to deal with whenever there are issues they do not listen and only go off paperwork which most of the time it is forged.  Management use intimidation not only with staff but also with client's to get them to do job trials and will suspend their payments for any reason if it was justifiable.   Epic's Behavior's these are implemented by management however management do not follow these but enforce staff to adhere to these.    Bottom line staff have little to no communication with Senior Leadership Team members yet they are the only staff that can give references when staff would like to leave. They do not base it off the work that you do and most of the Senior Leadership Team members do not know staff names or little about how the staff member works in a team etc. which would be beneficial for a new employer to know. The reference that they would provide is based of statistics which in the past have proved inconsistent with the database they use.   The client's that we service struggle with change yet whenever this feedback has been passed onto management they brush it under the carpet and advise they need to get use to change while this has some sense to it when client's have 4 consultant changes in 4 months this is beyond the need for them to adapt to change. This feedback was not taken on board and clients are suffering the constant change of consultant and confusion on who their consultant is.   One of the main disappointments with working for this company was when female staff would bring to management being uncomfortable in an office due to a male client coming in and being verbally abusive as well as punching the office walls that management has not done anything to assist in making sure that females feel comfortable in this site yet they are left to cover this site by themselves.,0.9988714,0.0009763539,0.00015213447

Lowest paying DES in the industry.  Management promote core values  but don't adhere to them themselves they lead with intimidation. There were always threats of losing our jobs if targets weren't met they would say the site would end up closed down  again more threats.   All types of abuse going on in my time there. Underhanded processes so that claims were able to be taken. The poor customers have more than 5 changes or so per year on EC caseloads  the customers scream for consistency and great customer service but upper management continually change staff's roles/sites and the staff are forever disconnecting from strong customer relationships they've built and apologizing to unhappy customers.   There is a narcissism in the air at times a lot of trumpets being blurted instead of head down bum up hard work being done. Offices lack professionalism boundaries by managers and staff sometimes followed suit. This is a sinking ship in my opinion JUMP don't come aboard!  Senior Leadership are the only references available. Most staff members have never met one! The references available would lack every detail required by a new employer and is a direct stand over tactic by EPIC to attempt to reduce staff from applying for roles at other DES providers.  EPIC is not about their customers. They are only about their bottom line $$$.,0.99864346,0.0011639621,0.00019259582

Nice people are where the positives stop. EPIC Assist is a company which takes nice people in chews them up and spits them out. You’ll never have seen a company which has such a high staff turnover like this one.   The turnover is high because the management have high KPIs set for everyone. People are intimidated and ruled with an iron fist. Every conversation from management comes back to getting people into employment 'placements'. Management will continually remind staff if they don't meet their placement targets they'll lose their jobs. If you don't work 150% you'll lose your job. If you're late because you had a family emergency that's right you'll lose your job.   This means you'll be working in fear for your job your financial security and your mental wellbeing. The dictatorship will see each minute of your day recorded and scrutinized. Your manager will be watching you from the corner of the office with one eye on you and their other eye watching Netflix. A good manager is one who leads their team by example not one who sits back and micromanages.   People join this company to help people with disability get sustainable employment. The pressure of management means people with disability are being placed into unsustainable employment and sometimes employment which sets them back in their journey.   If you work for this company you'll know intimately what it means to have disability. That's because you'll likely develop anxiety and depression while working here!,0.9968099,0.0029279045,0.00026218774

Evocca cares for neither the staff or the students at the college.    As a tutor you spend more time filling out various admin forms processing student expiries and extensions and logging contacts in order to protect the company from legal action than actually tutoring.

I've found the culture to be inspiring in many ways  from the obvious reason that your coworkers are hoping to make a positive difference to being involved in some of the most forwardthinking projects under development within Australia's built environment.  From my early days in the role I've felt embraced by my team. I've also been offered many perks to develop my own career. This includes opportunities to enrol in any number of courses offered by the GBCA and also a mentorship program within the organisation.  With the evergrowing list of sustainability targets we're seeing for our built environment and having a critical role in pushing the industry to meet these the GBCA offers a workplace suited to those who are hardworking and enjoy a fastpaced impactful environment.,0.00021254405,0.0003333074,0.9994542

I have been at the GBCA for almost 3 months. The GBCA has such a welcoming team who are always looking to help one another. I have always felt that my questions were welcomed which helped me to learn and grasp the work faster than I have in other work places. Because the work environment is so supportive of agile working it feels quite collaborative and can be tailored to our needs. I also really appreciate that management is quite understanding when it come to workload and understanding that the learning curve exists when first starting out. It also helped that the team have a training process in place that clearly sets goals and timelines for learning certain aspects.,0.00030782737,0.00073549146,0.9989567
When I first started there were a lot of different processes that existed on separate systems which was difficult to pick up immediately.

Top management does not seem to listen to its own people. Also they seem to use 'the board' as an excuse to do what they want to raise their own profile only... There should be a direct line from staff to board members to provide direct and unfiltered feedback about top management.

You are treated like slaves very micromanaged and talked down to constantly. My mental health completely declined working here. I questioned myself daily because of things my team leader said to me. I asked for help once to be literally called ""DUMB"". This work place was so toxic. They only care about making money for the company they do not care about the members or employees. Do better.

All of the changes initiated actually sent the company backwards as the environment is unpleasant.  2.	The culture in HCF is not good and this is evident by the results of the pulse engagement survey (53% out of 100%) in the last few years. They want to become a first class organisation by continuously pressuring staff to “raise their levels” and continuously pushing them to exceed expectation.  3.	There is no collaborative & Supportive culture within the team and staffs tends to hoard knowledge. It’s a very competitive environment and everybody tends to blame others when things go wrong.  4.	Management do not provide any support or direction they just give you a task and a deadline. There is no feeling that management are part of the team and they are very unapproachable.  5.

"Favouritism where there are 23 people in the team that gets all the interesting projects and work to do (and rewarded accordingly) whilst the rest of us have to work on the mundane day to day tasks and get no reward nor recognition for it.   Also the pay increases were abysmal. The favourites got decent pay increases (>10%) whilst the rest of us had to make do with 2% or less (some of us got none) and being told there was no budget for higher increases which was rubbish. The pay increases and rewards do not seem to be based upon contribution and what has been delivered but on how much one is a favourite of the senior manager and/or Chief. Senior managers have also lied about not giving pay increases where it is warranted i.e. where the pay is below market and senior managers have lied about increasing pay to match the market when previously they have said they will.  There are some people who are ""protected species"" where they can make multiple mistakes and/or stuff ups (some which are major e.g. high staff turnover in their team or poor decisions which destroy value and delay key projects) and there is no repercussions for them (and if they are a favourite of the Chief they get a very good pay increase too !!) however for the rest of us one small mistake (e.g. missing a space in front of a word in a document) and we are tagged as poor performers for the rest of the year. Also the nonfavourites of the senior managers and Chiefs (which is the majority of us) are purposely setup to fail with unrealistic KPIs and targets and the favourites of senior management seem to be able to stay on in the job no matter how much they stuff up make mistakes or just have a poor attitude towards completing work – seems like people are kept in jobs not based on their competency but on how well they get along with senior management.  Micromanagement of employees where everyone seems to be under some form of monitoring and our start/end times lunch breaks coffee breaks are always commented on whenever they run slightly longer with no consideration of circumstances (e.g. employee may have taken a slightly longer lunch break however they stayed till 7pm the same day). Snide comments are also made when anyone leaves at 5pm even though the employee may have come in extra early or have forgone their lunch break.  Employees are rated by whether they are present at their desk rather than their output and it does not matter when someone who is in the office from 9 – 5 delivers more work and is more productive than someone who is in the office for 12 hours.  Work from home is frowned upon by managers and actively discouraged. Managers have commented that ""everyone should be in the office as our job requires us to"" ""working from home is only allowed for those of a senior manager rank and above"" and ""if you are working from home there is no one to monitor what you do"".  A number of people managers are quite arrogant where they are dismissive and outwardly denigrate views of their subordinates that are not in line with their own. They have an attitude of “I’m a manager I know best” towards their subordinates and would refuse to even explain the underlying reasons for a decision being made or a request for work to be done. Also it seems like a lot of work is being done which is useless and fluffy and serves no purpose other than to boost the ego of the relevant Heads Of or Chief.  People managers who just play politics and are not interested in getting the work done. They will withhold information (on purpose) stonewall and come up with excuses to not help or assist people just so they can advance their own agenda and make themselves “look good” to senior management.  People managers who do not give clear instructions on how to get a task done (or none at all) and when asked about how to do it are told to “use your brain and work it out”. And the worse thing is when the task is handed over to be reviewed am told that “the quality is below par of what I expected” when expectations was not set from the start and poor instruction quality was provided.  People managers who change up the deadlines of a task and add more complexity to it (i.e. scope creep) as they do not know how to manage expectations of other stakeholders and they let their direct reports bear the brunt of their inability to say no. This creates a lot of stress and people are becoming annoyed/snappy/antagonistic towards one another because of all this stress.  People managers who cannot be trusted in anyway at all – trusted to have your back trusted to do the things they promised trusted to be honest and above all trusted to have empathy in dealing with their direct reports which they do not have any at all.  People managers are of the type where they are “do as I say not as I do”.   People managers who provide vague feedback i.e. “I think you need to improve on your time management skills” but when pressed for details they do not seem to be able or are unwilling to provide them as was told “you need to work this out yourself”. And lo and behold when it came to performance review time got marked down will be told “you didn’t improve on this” when no feedback was given nor was there any coaching offered to improve. It appears to be that people managers are looking for excuses to not give pay rises to deserving staff as achievements and other completed projects seemed to be overlooked when assessing performance and only negative feedback is provided and nothing positive is ever mentioned.  A lot of people managers also seem unable to take on feedback as well. An example is where they have made a mistake and it is pointed out they get very defensive about it which is hypocritical in the extreme as they delight in pointing out mistakes their own direct reports make (no matter how small) and to use that in marking them down in their annual review.  Jobs are being filled with those that the manager has worked with previously (either in prior firms or currently in HCF) and not advertised either internally or externally  Personal development is not based on what the employee wants but just solely on what the manager wants which most of the time is incongruent with the employee’s aspirations. This means that the employee ends up frustrated and angry as the manager designs processes to develop them in areas that they either have no interest in or have work piled on them that they do not have the capability to handle (and which the manager thinks is a development opportunity). In addition to this managers expect employees to train themselves in their own time with no support provided (both from a financial and time perspective).  Withholding of training opportunities where again the favourites of the team are allowed and provided the opportunity to attend external events and training sessions that helps develop their skills whilst the rest of us are excluded from it and are only aware of these events and training sessions when those that have went send out an email outlining what they learned from it.  There is no point in sending out emails saying that HCF supports mental wellbeing and you need to take time to look after your own mental health along with highlighting how much they donate to causes that champion it when a lot of people managers are the direct contributors to poor mental health in the workplace through their management practices. Really the best way to improve mental health is to actually improve the quality of people managers and to reassess how people managers are promoted to that position from within the organisation. In fact some of these people managers should be fired as they are bullies and psychopaths but they are kept on as senior management seems to turn a blind eye towards their bullying ways as these bullies happen to be “protected species”.",0.9980799,0.0017021211,0.00021798756

I've been working at Healthdirect Australia for a while now and it's been a fantastic experience so far. From the moment I joined I was struck by the team's passion for their work and dedication to making a difference in people's lives. One of the things that really sets Healthdirect Australia apart is the supportive and inclusive culture. Everyone is encouraged to contribute their ideas and perspectives and there's a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork. I feel like I'm part of a community that truly cares about each other and our collective mission. The company also places a lot of importance on professional development and growth. There are plenty of opportunities for training mentoring and upskilling which has helped me to enhance my skills and knowledge in areas I'm passionate about. In terms of the work itself I find it incredibly fulfilling to be part of a team that's making a real impact on people's health and wellbeing. Healthdirect Australia provides a range of services and resources that help people access the healthcare information and support they need which is especially important during these challenging times. Overall I would highly recommend Healthdirect Australia as a great place to work. The culture mission and people make it a truly special place to be and I feel lucky to be part of such a wonderful team.,0.00034281338,0.0004620971,0.99919504

"I've been working for more than 4 years with healthdirect. It used to be a very nice organisation where we celebrated skillset talent and respect for people. Lot of good people and experts left because of the ""Yes sir"" culture being promoted currently. That's the skillset you need and not about creating value. People are not allowed to suggest ideas and can't talk. ""Just do what I say"" culture even though you know the solution won't work. New leaders favours towards vendors whom they know/like to outsource work even those vendor are incapable to deliver and fail number of times in the past More trust on the vendor than internal employees or not willing to give opportunities for internal employees. If you want to blow the whistle they will give you the whistle as per the process but it doesn't make sound or make any change. Manager harassing his subordinate is common and even you raise it with the HR nothing will happen. Healthdirect is a no go for people who have skillset talent and wants to create value but talk. Even the project fails because of architect/manager decision the team will be blamed.

Strange culture which doesn't empower people in any way and opposite is true  all managers there would be happy if employees would never leave their boxes and do exactly what they have been told to not more. Opinions ignored or I would say even worse nobody would ever care to ask about any opinions. All decisions made by small closed group of managers and pushed down onto devs. Critical minded people not welcome. Engineers look scared they afraid to express opinions scared to not agree. Most of them would leave office to chat! Where will you see that?!? Technically they trying to catch up in terms of technologies but quality of code and architecture of existing applications is very low and that would be hard to change (and nobody actually trying I mean they make it look like they are but not really) because of reasons above. And of course meetings are loved here they take full day for some so all those managers and architects can report their time onto something (useless). It's quite strange as there were some smart people there (many left) but it never was really working mostly because of wrong culture. They really mostly operate in survival mode unable radically improve things. If you are contracting be even more careful as they don't respect contracts at all  it can be terminated any time not depending on your performance mostly because of poor planning.,0.9985257,0.0013322387,0.00014210328

Internal IT is terrible & don't even know how to use Windows properly let alone all the new Macs. Too much tolerance for poor performers creates animosity between teams.   Some high performing teams have isolated themselves to stop bad culture impacting them yet that creates more siloing across the company over time. Perks are effectively ZERO (haven't been taken to lunch by the boss once in almost two years what a joke.) company has no notion of celebrating success that doesn't involve you buying your own beer after work. People investment is basically nil: you have to find a way to leverage your job opportunities or go backwards in your career.  The HR team has full time people appointed to achieve not much except sending some managers on a course or two. Company culture too often apes the government & uses those shareholders as an excuse for having poor/no vision for the company direction & what we need to be investing in for longer term. Want to take a team meeting over lunch or coffee?  Prepare to pay for everything yourself as the company is obsessed with not spending on employees... yet wastes loads of money in other areas through poor efficiency focus and lack of retention planning (constant stream of recruitment fees leaving the building).,0.99899155,0.00084686937,0.0001616343

"Challenges Faced: Siloed Teams: It's astonishing how disconnected the various teams are within this company. The left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing leading to a frustrating lack of collaboration and coordination. This silo mentality hampers progress and creates unnecessary hurdles at every turn. Poor Planning and Communication at the Senior Management Level: The senior management fail miserably in their duties. Their inability to plan effectively and communicate clearly is mindboggling. This lack of direction and guidance trickles down to every level of the organisation resulting in confusion wasted time and missed opportunities. Lack of Accountability and Support from Senior Management: One would expect senior management to be pillars of support and accountability. Unfortunately that is not the case here. Instead they shirk their responsibilities and conveniently shift the blame onto others down the chain. Their lack of support leaves employees feeling abandoned and disheartened. Overworked and Stressed Workforce: The workload is unrelenting and overwhelming. Employees are constantly pushed to their limits resulting in extreme stress and burnout. It is no wonder that talented individuals eventually leave disillusioned and exhausted by the constant demands placed upon them. Neglected ICT/Finance Systems: The company's refusal to invest in modern ICT and finance systems is a major hindrance. Outdated and inefficient systems only add to the workload creating unnecessary manual tasks and reducing productivity. The lack of investment in this crucial area is baffling and counterproductive. Senior Managers Lost in relentless Meetings: Senior managers seem to spend more time in constant overlong meetings than actually taking action. Endless discussions without concrete outcomes further exacerbate the issues faced by the organisation. This lack of action is a clear indication of their ineffectiveness and detachment from reality. Lack of Performance Reviews and Team Engagement: The absence of performance reviews is indicative of a management team that lacks the courage to confront issues headon. They are uncomfortable engaging with their teams and addressing problems constructively. This avoidance only perpetuates existing problems and stifles growth. Blatant Deflection of Responsibility: Rather than taking responsibility for their actions or decisions management prefers to pass the buck down the chain. This behaviour not only undermines trust and morale but also hinders progress and resolution of pressing issues. Repeated ""RightSizing"": The company's habit of conducting ""rightsizing"" exercises is both disruptive and demoralising. Permanent staff members are either made redundant or forced to reapply for lesserpaid positions. This constant instability and uncertainty breed a toxic work environment. Lack of Actionable Vision and Strategy: Despite the lip service paid to the importance of vision and strategy senior management fails to translate these buzzwords into actionable plans. The lack of investment in critical areas coupled with the absence of a clear direction hampers growth and stifles innovation.",0.9990644,0.00078215497,0.00015347403

 The National Support Centre (Client Service Advisor / CSA) team is incredibly well curated  it is truly inspiring and encouraging to work with such a large number of like minded individuals who are passionate about the sexual/reproductive health sector and other sociopolitical values by proxy. However the staff turnover is notably high within this team due to insufficient pay for the workload which offers little incentive to stay or affects one's sustainable ability to stay despite the (of course) rewarding experience of directly assisting and advocating for people who are accessing these services. The CSA role is hard work and the remuneration does not reflect this. Big burnout energy.    The office environment is fairly trans/gender diverse friendly; management go to a fair amount of effort to normalise the use of correct pronouns which is refreshing in a professional context. However there is so much work to be done in terms of ensuring the services themselves are trans/gender diverse conscious. Specific individuals work tirelessly to educate others within the organisation and encourage others to use more inclusive language on our website social media and when engaging with patients directly but it hasn't caught on. This organisation has great potential to be more inclusive (for example introducing streamlined care for LGBTQIA people and affiliated services) but The Executive team who have the ability to make changes are lagging in this regard. Add some resources on our website change the language and acknowledge their existence and relevance within this sector. It's not that hard and there have been enough conversations and suggestions made internally. I suggest you develop positions/a specific team of LGBTQIA identifying people to help implement these changes. As the largest abortion provider/sexual/reproductive health organisation in the country your hesitance to step away from womencentric rhetoric is sad frustrating and outdated. Learn from Family Planning and 1800 My Options.    The Financial Support team have worked so hard to develop various financial support pathways to assist people who are not able to comfortably afford services. I am so proud of and impressed by the amount of effort that specific individuals have put into creating these pathways and the acknowledgement that if a patient can't pay we must prioritise their right to access services regardless.,0.972607,0.023620455,0.0037725824
" Despite fronting as a NFP this organisation is revenue driven and benefits monetarily as a private clinic resulting in a questionable industrial complex (though it is understood that profits made contribute to the company's philanthropy sector MSI). CSAs are managed via KPIs (which are unfairly determined as they calculate how many total calls result in bookings including enquiry and nonbooking related calls) which is ethically questionable within this sector  ESPECIALLY considering Marie Stopes have put forward a White Paper on reproductive coercion. CSAs are tirelessly encouraged to ensure a patient finalises a booking when they first make contact  emphasising value for revenue over providing patients with unbiased options and information. Endless suggestions from CSAs have been made to remove KPIs but concerns are always dismissed and we are advised they are essential in tracking the organisation's progress.    CSAs complete compulsory training at the beginning of employment to learn a large network of processes and responsibilities akin to the role. This huge breadth of information and knowledge is fantastic to learn and processes are often changing and updating but there are limited ongoing learning opportunities from there other than extra operational duties. While the role itself is a great learning experience it would be great if the organisation included opportunities for external learning such as suicide prevention training and traumainformed care (which seems quintessential for us as frontline workers but has never been explored) or other sexual/reproductive health courses. There are many passionate people who are drawn to the role due to the nature of the sector but the position itself doesn't lend much room for expansion specialisation or qualification. The role is better suited to people who like working pragmatically within a strict structure as closely adhering to their processes is a must. If you are particularly passionate about and engaged with intersectional inclusive sexual/reproductive health rights this role acts as a double edged sword  on the one hand you have a great opportunity to engage with patients however seeing where improvements can be made and wanting to advocate for progressive changes will not work in your favour... Management will push you out. They want employees who can stick to the basics of the role maintain targets and keep the revenue rolling in.   There is a lot of emphasis placed on CSAs to maintain their mental health and work/life balance (particularly as they are responsible for first contact patient intake). This expectation is unrealistic due to limited internal resources disproportionate pay to workload and KPI management tactics. The team itself are extremely emotionally supportive but the organisation should go to MUCH more effort to offer more varied mental health support pathways to take the pressure off interpersonal relationships. Many CSAs have noted the EAP provider to be insufficient and many find monthly one on one catch ups with management to be unhelpful and counterproductive as they are framed too heavily around ""performance"" analysis  contributing to toxic corporate call centre culture.",0.9948297,0.0048375977,0.0003326402

 My manager is one of those rare true leaders that trusts me to do my job and allows me to get on with it. She also empowers me to take more on and respects and asks for my opinion.  Our MD has vision and he values feedback but also genuinely want to improve wherever possible and he always listens to reason. He is also incredibly accessible which for someone at his level is not something I have ever had in any other organisation I have worked for. Overall he runs a smooth ship and gives me confidence that we're doing well as an organisation.  During the COVID19 outbreak our executive team have done a stellar job of maintaining communication keeping employees calm whilst still maintaining essential services. No one has lost their job yet within the organisation and everyone is committed to making sure it stays that way. A lot of other organisations haven't handled this situation nearly as well as ours and that's quite impressive! It also encourages respect for our leadership team.  The employees within the organisation have this unspoken bond that unite us all and it comes down to people genuinely believing in what we do. It's powerful and it's inspirational!

We just need to manage that a bit more and a bit better but this is something that the HRD is all over and continuously working on.

Our nurses need to be paid more. Again this is a known issue and is being worked on but we need to make sure we don't get complacent and let good people leave before we really take action.

 The people you work with at this organisation are incredible. Super passionate incredibly competent and generous with their time.   The head office is a great central location  Working here gives you an opportunity to work towards better social equality for a cause that's really important  COO is friendly supportive and trying his best under what are obviously difficult circumstances,0.0007910524,0.0005462644,0.9986627
 There has been a 50% turnover in head office staff within the past 12 months. At no point has management felt the need to address what is obviously causing this; a toxic working environment   The favouritism and nepotism are quite blatant. Personal friends of the CEO Michelle Thompson are hired for roles while her staff favourites seem immune from any performance management for unprofessional conduct.  This can be seen from the high turnover of newer staff but the longevity of preferred employees.    The organisation consistently hires incredibly competent and capable staff. The organisation's mission attracts people who are passionate. However these employees are micromanaged to the point where they have no real authority in their role. This also leads many staff to feel that their expertise suggestions and work are not respected.   Concerns raised about serious mental health issues and staff burnout (which is not unexpected in what is obviously a very high stress industry) are routinely ignored. Often these concerns are dismissed as not existing at all. Management refuses to participate in any form of employee engagement surveying or other similar efforts that could determine staff satisfaction and wellbeing.    Michelle Thompson seems to have no ability to emotionally regulate and so staff are at the mercy of her constantly changing temperament. She regularly targets teams or individuals and conducts impromptu sessions of berating them in the middle of the open plan office. This does not improve staff morale.    COO receives no support from Michelle Thompson and often appears pressured into accomodating her demands. COO spends extensive hours in the office while Michelle appears to arrive and depart at leisure routinely disappearing for hours on end with no transparency as to any projects she is working.    Staff are rarely given updates as to what upper management are working on which makes it difficult for them to be engaged in the journey or invested in the organisation's success.    Upper management often set unrealistic goals and targets and then fail to provide the resources necessary to meet them. The overall attitude from Michelle Thompson is then that staff are not working hard enough to meet targets. These targets net Michelle a personal financial windfall but staff receive no such benefits and often receive no acknowledgement for the long hours and high stress they invest in trying to meet these targets.    The organisation is NFP so resources are limited however the majority of staff are highly overworked and underresourced for the roles they are given. It's not at all unusual for a staff member to leave and for their colleague to then be expected to work both roles without additional remuneration. Despite the lower staff salaries no alternative incentives are offered such as flexible working arrangements additional annual leave etc.    Upper management seems to be unaware that any of this is an issue and regularly comment on the inability to retain quality staff. If they are aware of it they refuse to acknowledge any of the above issues and instead become hostile towards staff who express any dissatisfaction with the way the organisation is run.,0.9987649,0.0010367791,0.000198413

There is a culture of obfuscating and politicking with an under current of control and lack of collaboration within the department I worked within.  As a whole the organisation appears to want to change the way they work for the better but the senior leadership team are comfortable so they have all the appearance but no real intention or appetite to get the right things done. There is also a lack of consideration for the role of communications.

So many! A new CEO started in 2019 and the culture has gone downhill. The focus is all on money. The perception is that staff aren't working hard but they are often on weekends and evenings when he's finished for the day. The Board is completely out of touch and never even talks to employees when they are in the office. The Board and management are full of egos politics and selfinterested people.

Midlevel managers are sometimes promoted due to being at the company for a long time. As a result managers can lack motivation and aspiration to make changes listen to feedback from other staff and improve programs. Despite receiving feedback from staff regularly  these managers remain unchanged in practice. This leads to staff delivering meidocre programs at times and resulting in burnout/overturn.,0.99897623,0.0008664811,0.00015729535

In my opinion the leadership at SALDA take advantage of the caring nature of their staff and don't provide adequate resources and support. The majority of staff are people who have chosen to work in caring professions. They are given increasing amounts of work without support of resources guidance or supervision. This could be because current Leadership has never worked in and appears to have no understanding of clinical practice in Allied Health. At some point often quickly staff are overworked and burnt out. Combine this with a lack of appropriate financial compensation and they leave within a year or so.,0.99899393,0.00082288973,0.00018313393

Great food in the cafeteria cooked daily on site.  Easy parking under main roof.  Managers work hard to roster nurses to allow for work life balance. Nurses have access to regular CPD and scholarships to pay for post graduate studies in a clinical specialty or leadership program.  Lovely gardens and nearby parkland. Positive culture throughout the organisation.  Flat management structure means staff have access to senior management.  Stand alone organisation means no other hospitals in the group to slow down decision making. Range of clinical areas and expertise (ICU Cardiac Oncology Colorectal Orthopaedics and many more).  Dedicated educators in Theatre Recovery Anaesthetics and ICU and the wards. Penalty allowances for out of hours work.,0.00039161183,0.00032128982,0.99928707

Four months in and this has already been one of the more supportive work environments I've ever experienced due to the priority it places on culture collaboration and effective leadership. The workplace is flexible and understanding that you have a life and outside commitments. It is also interested in supporting staff with learning and development opportunities so you can grow in your field. I think the CEO knows pretty well everyone's name  which for a staff of 800 is pretty fantastic!

An individual in the Executive Office that reports directly to the CEO is a unprofessional person who has no morals or ethics whatsoever with regard to the way people are treated. Underhanded tactics playing games with employees and their welfare take up more of their day to day activity than the actual job itself. The toxic atmosphere this person creates is unbelievable. Hard to believe this person supports someone so important to the hospital yet has no communication skills.

The few pros are completely overshadowed by the complete and utter lack of leadership overwhelming micromanagement the lack of flexibility for everyone that is not in an executive position and the poor rates of salary (which completely overshadows the benefit of additional tax free salary). The big brother environment including timed 30 minute lunch breaks suffocates even the brightest of spirits and sends the most enthusiastic staff member into a lengthy bouts of depression. The young bright sparks are trampled on by outrageous levels of insecurity of senior management and even the suggestion of finishing early on Christmas Eve was trampled by the CEO. The awful work environment is only compounded by the very difficult subject matter upon which the organisation is based on. The majority of staff have lost compassion and speak of the people they're helping with disdain. Going through the motions seems to be a prerequisite of successful employment here followed closely second by sleeping with your boss to obtain a position (no pun intended) of leadership whilst maintain a complete and utter lack of competence in your profession.   The general tone? Negative soul destroying as uttered by current and past employees alike. Those that are still there only remain because of little choice in a challenging work environment.

Extremely corrupt organisation that refuses to disclose their annual financials. Staff at the bottom end are expected to work unpaid overtime on a daily basis in conditions that are unsafe filthily and unbelievably laborious. Bullying is rife within the organisation particularly with area mangers  boards members and higher management. HR are just a smoke screen for the corruption that exists in higher management. Innocent staff are deliberately 'set up' by  management to make it appear they are not doing their job and are subsequently unfairly dismissed.

Working for Employment Plus was one of the worst professional experiences I have ever had. This was largely in part to the management of the site but extends right up to regional and executive levels.  There was a bullying culture across the sites and the level of micromanagement I experienced was almost unbelievable. Constantly being reprimanded or pulled up for my actions via emails sent late at night (not even the courtesy of speaking in a face to face capacity) without being given the opportunity to explain why things had been gone about in a particular way.  There was never an encouraging word spoken by the site lead the team worked so hard but were only ever reminded of their failings   it's no wonder the staff turnover here is so high no one can be expected to perform well and enthusiastically at their job when they don't receive any encouragement or support!  Site leads and senior managers were observed openly bullying an employee from a different contract and later heard swearing and saying nasty things about said employee and their superiors after the confrontation  if that isn't a direct contradiction of The Salvo's values I don't know what is and is only just one example of the management team demonstrating unethical and snakelike behaviour.  Someone below mentioned that the clients here were treated like dollar signs and I couldn't agree more  having worked for both private and NFP providers I would never have thought that the NFP was the place I would see jobseekers being treated with the least amount of care and respect.  Staff were expected to reach blown out KPI's and put on unachievable performance management plans that meant that just to keep their job they had to put in upwards of an hour and half over time EVERY DAY.,0.99890554,0.000929754,0.00016468993

"Where do I begin?1. JobActive training was a 2 week process none of which was applicable as the main focus was on initial sign ups. No proper intro into systems.2. Bad Management. The management team (area managers and higher) were fake and cleverly tried to push that they were all about values but never valued the staff. 3. No structure/constant process changes. One process would be changed on a weekly basis as ""management"" tried to work out the best strategies to squeeze the most money out of the JobActive contract.4. Threatening staff with termination on a regular basis and making you feel as if there was very little job security.5. Low staff morale: turnover is so high because those experienced in the industry know that the Salvo's is a joke and the newer staff realising that thier big spiel on 'The Salvo's' brand was NOT what you are actually doing on a daily basis. The EPLUS section is totally disconnected from the actual 'Salvation Army' with the local Salvo's stores not even opening up spaces for work for the dole because they prefer working with Matchworks or any other provider. 6. Idiotic Site Leads: who are just puppets that do not provide 'leadership'7. Delivery: every single candidate was looked at as a $ figure.8. Moving on from the Salvo's is like leaving a company with a bad reputation every other JobActive provider nicknames them as 'Dollars Plus'. Either because they know that the Salvo's are money hungry or they know that Salvo's regularly do dodgy processes and unethical practices to try and get the 'star rating'.9.

There is no real leadership. There is secrecy and lack of communication so divisions work in silos Management are dysfunctional and power hungry and the good leaders they hire end up being kicked out by the CEO that dislikes to be challenged. Incompetent employees that are lazy and spend their days doing personal stuff either on the phone or online get promoted to managers just for being the boss' friend  with no open fair recruitment and selection process.  Employees are scared to talk but burn out and demotivated. Services managers doing two jobs in one hardly get paid much more to do the two jobs. Consequently they leave and that impacts the clients and the whole organisation. Staff are becoming more and more demotivated stressed tired negative overworked and they don't feel appreciated.

Small institution means that staff are tasked with somewhat more responsibility and wider scope compared to a larger institution where roles are more specialised and defined. This makes it a good place to become exposed to multiple areas of administration and business in a quick way and will suit those who can rise to the challenge and take on responsibility willingly. But the flip side to this is that there are limited resources staff and financial at this institution so often the ambition is constrained by the reality.  Staff are really quite excellent and capable compared to lower ranking universities. Smaller also means that there are opportunities to make meaningful connections through work and there is a degree of trust between colleagues,0.0037395456,0.04801003,0.9482504
University has underinvested in staff resources over the years which means that there is little opportunity to advance career within the university and usually you will have to leave to find better salary position etc Although most people come from elsewhere to work at the university the city itself is a bit parochial and lacks diversity and culture activities.

"The biggest issue for research staff like postdocs and higher level researchers who are not tenured is that you get placed on short term contracts.

Lot of hassle to relocate to Newcastle for nothing. For contract tech staff contract renewal seems to be a lottery  no one seems to know if they'll get their contracts renewed or not.  The VC seems to paralyzed in terms of making funding decisions to support research centres. The whole issue has been dragging on for 3 years or more leaving people in limbo regarding their contracts.  In terms of job opportunities lots of admin positions etc abound.  Research?

This uni appears to have almost no commitment to doing excellent work at the student or staff levels. Following on the VC's leadership there is only a commitment to numbers doing things that will result in good numbers for the uni even if the reality is quite different. That is not what unis are meant to be. Most staff and students would like to be striving for excellence not fake numbers.,0.9970202,0.0027739054,0.00020586948

Wellrespected regional university at the national and global level. A good choice for a study/research university performing at or near the top of the nonGroup of Eight universities. The bush campus is lovely and some of the buildings are nice and modern (though definitely not all of them). Good facilities on campus including gym chemist banks food outlets.  Flexitime is offered and you will have autonomy over your own time supervision is focused on the fact that you get the work done not micromanaging your day. It's a big organisation and generally a good friendly working environment though it largely depends on specifically where you are.

Traffic and lack of parking will drive you nuts.  Hard to get permanent arrangements lots of contract positions and uncertainty leading to lack of job security. Don't bother if you're IT. Some divisions going through restructure leading to VRs. Salaries are ok but lacklustre compared to Sydney because Newcastle is a pretty captive market and the Uni is a big employer here. They know they can get someone willing to do the job for the minimum pay. Not a lot of chance to have a career that keeps moving onwards and upwards.

"The culture is toxic. Bullying harassment and discrimination is rife and blatant. There is very little development opportunity and senior managers are appointed more due to their political skills rather than having any genuine management experience and/or qualifications. There is an ""old boys club"" mentality that dates back decades and the place is being run into the ground as a result. The amount of money wasted at this institution is criminal and there does not appear to be any likelihood for any reform. The UoN's most senior managers appear blissfully unaware that there are huge issues within the corrupt and unethical organisation  if anyone points out any issues or attempts to suggest that improvements could be made they are branded ""troublemakers"" told to toe the line and/or either leave of their own accord or are pushed out. It is sadly a case of the lunatics running the asylum for the most part. If you are currently sane this reviewer recommends you stay so and seek employment elsewhere. If your underqualified for a management position have no formal training in management and are skilled at blindly saying ""Yes"" never questioning your superiors and don't mind treating your staff like worthless leaches   this is the place for you.  I have rated the Rem and Bens neutrally below because they are excellent  on the surface of things  however come at a huge cost to your dignity quality of life and selfrespect  so in my opinion are really not worth it.",0.99890447,0.0009343801,0.00016116894

If you want to use your AOD skills to make a difference in the lives of young people this place will give you that.  The facilities are good and they have group supervision for workers.  There are a couple of mid management people who are supportive of staff.  The purpose of YSAS existence is very motivating.,0.00030328002,0.00071761257,0.9989791
The shifts are not managed well.  You may have a few night shifts then suddenly morning shift etc without any recovery time.  Covert bullying is rife and many in management roles are either blind to it or they do not have the skills to address it.  Staff will not survive this workplace unless you know how to dodge around in the minefield of this kind of workplace culture. The pay is not great but no work in this sector pays well. You have to have a sense of 'higher purpose' or 'passion for the cause' to work in this area.,0.99890125,0.00093485654,0.0001637969
