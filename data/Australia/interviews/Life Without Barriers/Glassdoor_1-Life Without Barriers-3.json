There were four assessors walking around and listening to each group's contributions - you are being watched from the moment you step into the room! It was quite a fun experience and a lot more relaxed than anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe 1:1 interview was a bit more formal and conducted by a panel of two upper management personnel. They didn't really ask about relevant experience/qualifications which was surprising. Instead they asked about my idea of the organisation, the job role etc. There were also about 3-4 scenario based questions.

Was given a chance to talk about my career and was asked some standard interview questions as well as a scenario.\r\n\r\nPros: Fairly friendly interviewers, fair questions. Interview was conducted on time. \r\n\r\nCons: I had read about some contentious practices at LWB, and read a few negative reviews on Glassdoor from employees, particularly around a lack of professionalism, and poor management. I wanted to form my own opinion by observing when I was there, and didn't get a great impression. \r\n\r\nThere was a lot of loud banter/swearing and laughter coming from the office when I arrived (may have been a staff party/event), which was a bit odd for a Tuesday mid-afternoon. Also, didn't get a glass of water when I arrived, so had a mouth like Ghandi's sandals by the end of the interview (I know it's a little thing but it's a common courtesy and the least you can do for someone who could potentially be feeling nervous). The two blokes who interviewed me seemed pretty aloof and when asked about the challenges of the role/how it was to work in it, they confirmed that it was a lot of extra work/picking up after team mistakes/absences etc. including potentially having to complete the work of other roles on my team as required. I'm all for collaboration, and I think they were just being honest, but I took it as 'mate probably don't work here unless you want a chaotic work environment', which was a bit of a turn off.\r\n\r\nI ended up getting a call back from them saying that they wanted to offer a different role for me, to which I declined, as I had made the decision I wouldn't want to work there, and had been offered and taken another role elsewhere. Stupidly, I didn't ask them what that role was, but I would imagine it would've been as a team member, not a leader.", "Interview Questions": "They asked me typical interview questions, but did throw a curveball by giving me a scenario.
