Both interviews were conducted by two people who did not understand the job at all, which was obvious from the questions and the feedback. They didn't understand the common 'jargon' they associate with the type of role, so when their inexperience became obvious, I didn't use it as much as I could have. However, they seemed to think this indicated a lack of experience, despite that obviously not being the case based on my resume, answers, and test response (which they said was \"the very best of the bunch\"). The test itself was overly long and complicated, and was alost completely irrelevant to what they were supposedly looking for with the role.\r\n\r\nOther red flags: * The role had only been in existence for 13 months, and this was the fourth time they were hiring for the role. * I did not apply for the role, but interviewed after being approached by 3 separate HCF HR reps about this role, on the same day, via LI. I thought they were 3 separate Product Designer roles as they were described by each person so differently: junior, mid, and senior level, paying anywhere between $80k and $160k pa. * The job description was overloaded, nonsensical, contradictory, and full of nothing but job-specific jargon used incorrectly. * The job was advertised as remote, but was stated to be hybrid, with no details about what that actually meant. Everyone else on the team was interstate. * They couldn't tell me what I would actually be working on, or what type of professionals I'd be working on the same team as. * They couldn't tell me what they were actually looking for, but it wasn't really a Product Designer, but a combination of about 4 different roles.", "Interview Questions": "The questions were all overly-long and complicated, and it was never clear as to what they actually wanted from your answer.
