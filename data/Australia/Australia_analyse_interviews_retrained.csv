Entered the interview process and was quite easy and straightforward. Was a easy process throughout and the atmosphere felt like it would be nice to join the organisation. I would recommend applying to this organisation.,0.007853849,0.23140316,0.760743
It was an hourlong interview. Overall it was pretty smooth. I tried to be confident and relaxed when answering the questions. They also asked behavioural questions such as 'described a time when you handles a challenging situation',0.00048799624,0.9985146,0.0009974275
The interview process was quite casual but maintained an air of formality. The questions asked were mainly about gauging your personality and how that would fit in with the social brand. Overall it felt like they wanted to ensure that their members had commitment and good values.,0.0006175564,0.9983171,0.001065364
There are 3 rounds if you pass one you get an email inviting you to the next round. I got to individual interview but got declined. They generously scheduled a session to give overall feedback but it was quite general.

Write a platform. Challenges and election. Platforms contain lots of questions have to format carefully.  Challenges are done in videos and ways that requires reaching out to alumni.

fairly straightforward and quick process. all up took about a week and a half to get through. the process was:  1. online application  2. invitation to group assessment 3. individual interview with two panelists,0.0027881311,0.92525643,0.07195538
The interview process was fairly brief with three sections. They were mostly about my strengths and weaknesses. The interviewers were super helpful and understanding if I needed some time to think.,0.0012490667,0.9239293,0.07482165
They have a group interview then an individual interview. The group interview is just playing some games like building a tower using spaghetti and marshmallow thinking of a world problem then present it as a group. Individual questions are mostly behavior questions. It lasts for around 30 minutes.,0.089567505,0.91006255,0.00036989085

"Two interviews and a ""short"" test. Both interviews were conducted by two people who did not understand the job at all which was obvious from the questions and the feedback. They didn't understand the common 'jargon' they associate with the type of role so when their inexperience became obvious I didn't use it as much as I could have. However they seemed to think this indicated a lack of experience despite that obviously not being the case based on my resume answers and test response (which they said was ""the very best of the bunch""). The test itself was overly long and complicated and was alost completely irrelevant to what they were supposedly looking for with the role.  Other red flags:  The role had only been in existence for 13 months and this was the fourth time they were hiring for the role.  I did not apply for the role but interviewed after being approached by 3 separate HCF HR reps about this role on the same day via LI. I thought they were 3 separate Product Designer roles as they were described by each person so differently: junior mid and senior level paying anywhere between $80k and $160k pa.  The job description was overloaded nonsensical contradictory and full of nothing but jobspecific jargon used incorrectly.  The job was advertised as remote but was stated to be hybrid with no details about what that actually meant. Everyone else on the team was interstate.  They couldn't tell me what I would actually be working on or what type of professionals I'd be working on the same team as.  They couldn't tell me what they were actually looking for but it wasn't really a Product Designer but a combination of about 4 different roles.",0.998283,0.0015714954,0.00014555658
"In the online video interview I had included the hiring manager and a branch manager and they took turns asking me questions. It was super thorough ""what if"" questions and I felt like I was being grilled for over 60 minutes.",0.99646425,0.003358293,0.0001774984

I was shown this contract role by a recruiter who set up the interview. The 1 and only interview I had included the hiring manager and the HR lady and they took turns asking me questions. It was very very thorough and I felt like I was being grilled for 60 minutes. They said the recruiter would get back to me with the outcome but they never did.,0.99475986,0.00509871,0.0001414505
Long process. Video interview n if you clear that then face to face interview process which involved group activity and role play. Took about 3 hrs in the office. N a few good weeks until the final results,0.9414118,0.05749022,0.0010980298
Very poor. Poor preparation from HCF HR staff led to a confusing and below par interview experience. I was contacted by the HR department who seemed a little unprepared about why they were contacting me which seemed strange. The questions they asked me on the phone were unplanned and delivered without compassion or confidence. In short this was a very poor introduction to the company.,0.9990772,0.0007677278,0.00015508964
It was one hour of getting to know me about the role behavioural questions and an exercise. Unfortunately the position base location was not as advertised so I went through an interview to be rejected. It took 1.5 weeks to know in total and there was a survey to fill out about the experience.,0.99799144,0.0018902126,0.00011840741
After applying through Seek I received an invite to a video interview which asked multiple questions and then allowed space for you to record your answer (you couldn’t rerecord so best to be as prepared as possible). Once this was submitted I received a face to face interview in head office with HR and the regional manager. It was very straightforward asked scenario based questions around sales service etc. HR were wonderful and professional to deal with throughout the whole process from start to finish.,0.0007809895,0.0063230083,0.992896
Felt as though interview itself could've been handled better.. it was a 1 hour interview of solely them just asking me question after question. No breaks/ ice breakers or any other conversation. Also noted very repetitive questions..,0.99754936,0.0023253292,0.00012531105
The process was fantastic the timeframe between the first and second interview was quick. The hiring managers were transparent and welcoming. It was a structured interview but became quite conversational towards the end. Overall a good experience.,0.0004314856,0.001124399,0.99844414
first interview was with a recruiter then with PMO manager. whole process went very quick as they needed someone to start very soon. it was an easy straightforward process which took around two weeks from the first interview till I got the offer,0.0024993985,0.94607675,0.051423907
Through a recruitment company initially. Met with the manager and his assistant sat and had a nice long chat for about an hour before they thanked me. Good behaviour based questions with realistic answers to my questions about the role and company. Good time frames for response. They were obviously eager to hire as I received an offer the next day.   Overall not as structured as I know some companies are with their recruitment process and I was surprised that such a large company was nimble enough to make an offer so quickly. Normal bureaucracy is clearly reserved for once you are an existing employee.,0.008184866,0.05115583,0.94065934
The interview process was very easy. I received an invitation to interview the same day I applied. The panel asked me some questions about my experience in terms of working with children. I was asked about how I can handle working with children and youth in difficult circumstances.,0.0017160211,0.9876292,0.010654916
Well sequenced generous time allocated and additional comments by interviewers made it more conversational which really assisted in being able to show case my skills.

First stage interview was a oneway video interview (through Sonru). Asked 5x questions mostly soft questions one a general question about approach to data management. Each question had a time limit of about 12mins with 30 secs to prep before the recording started. The next stage was a panel interview via MS Teams with the direct manager their  manager and a team member. This had a mix of soft and technical questions.,0.00090878044,0.9987795,0.00031172665
The interview went longer than expected. The interviewer introduced you to other team members. The interviewer provided you with a lot of details about the company or open position. The interviewer talked a lot about future opportunities.,0.0014535375,0.99789536,0.00065099995
Applied online had a group interview with 20 other applicants two weeks after applying. Had 1:1 interview 2 days after group interview.  Group training involved scenarios introducing yourself and background to the whole group doing smaller teamwork activities and then presenting these to the whole group. There were four assessors walking around and listening to each group's contributions  you are being watched from the moment you step into the room! It was quite a fun experience and a lot more relaxed than anticipated.  The 1:1 interview was a bit more formal and conducted by a panel of two upper management personnel. They didn't really ask about relevant experience/qualifications which was surprising. Instead they asked about my idea of the organisation the job role etc. There were also about 34 scenario based questions. If you have worked with children before answers are quite common knowledge.,0.003369493,0.40930647,0.587324

Submitted a resume and cover letter and this via an email process.  I also contacted a current worker for current vacancies that were congruent with my current skills qualifications and experience.  This was an email to the manager with my attached resume and cover letter applying for the role.  I also was invited for an interview probably a week after submitting this information.,0.0023844955,0.9974032,0.00021225215
The interview was in person with two members of the staff team with which I'd be working including my wouldbe manager. Was given a chance to talk about my career and was asked some standard interview questions as well as a scenario.  Pros: Fairly friendly interviewers fair questions. Interview was conducted on time.   Cons: I had read about some contentious practices at LWB and read a few negative reviews on Glassdoor from employees particularly around a lack of professionalism and poor management. I wanted to form my own opinion by observing when I was there and didn't get a great impression.   There was a lot of loud banter/swearing and laughter coming from the office when I arrived (may have been a staff party/event) which was a bit odd for a Tuesday midafternoon. Also didn't get a glass of water when I arrived so had a mouth like Ghandi's sandals by the end of the interview (I know it's a little thing but it's a common courtesy and the least you can do for someone who could potentially be feeling nervous). The two blokes who interviewed me seemed pretty aloof and when asked about the challenges of the role/how it was to work in it they confirmed that it was a lot of extra work/picking up after team mistakes/absences etc. including potentially having to complete the work of other roles on my team as required. I'm all for collaboration and I think they were just being honest but I took it as 'mate probably don't work here unless you want a chaotic work environment' which was a bit of a turn off.  I ended up getting a call back from them saying that they wanted to offer a different role for me to which I declined as I had made the decision I wouldn't want to work there and had been offered and taken another role elsewhere. Stupidly I didn't ask them what that role was but I would imagine it would've been as a team member not a leader.,0.9878164,0.011915163,0.00026848097

Panel of 3 mixed gender. Each member took times in asking questions. The interview took place on the premises. I don't think that the process illicited enough of the information that I would have wanted in their place.
