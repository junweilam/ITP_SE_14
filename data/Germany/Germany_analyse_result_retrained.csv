Exciting chance to work abroad while having some form of a safety net.  The role has varied responsibilities and experience depends so much on the individual school.

Health insurance is limited to acute illness which means you will have to buy your own if you have any form of health condition.

From the perspective of a scientist / postdoc: Really diverse scientific environment plenty of collaboration opportunities within and without Charite several other biomedical institutes in Berlin including two Max Planck Institutes the Max Delbrück Institute Robert Koch Institute and others. Everywhere there are bright scientists both PIs and students. Working at Charite is really interesting for a scientist. Salary as usual at such institutions in Germany is predetermined according to your salary category and years of experience no surprises here either bad or good. Berlin: great public transport great atmosphere great culture.,0.00037711713,0.0019144786,0.99770844
Charite is really huge so I am not trying to blame the administration plenty of them are working hard. However going through official channels to buy a laptop or even a paper notebook can be incredibly frustrating. Same with conferences travels books lab equipment consumables etc.etc. Everything takes a lot of time and requires a lot of effort on your part esp. filling out puzzling forms mostly in German and using weird internal IT systems or at best SAP. Some obstacles remain insurmountable. You have to participate in mandatory online trainings aimed mostly at nurses and technical staff and mostly in German. In general unlike at pure research institutions ability to speak German is much more important here. Internet access and usage is severly restricted (again forms forms forms) mostly because of the tons of sensitive patient data but annoying nonetheless. A lot of the IT infrastructure is obsolete or in a semiworking condition. The intranet pages are a horror. Getting a permanent position is unlikely. PI's are usually older white male Germans. Some of them can be really full of themselves. Living in Berlin can be quite expensive especially renting an appartment within a reasonable commuting time. Charite itself is not one campus but multiple sites spread throughout whole Berlin so depending on where you work you may have a very different experience of living.,0.99834883,0.0015069686,0.00014419405

1. Strong interview skills & analysis: they assessed my expertise and suggested me a different position than what I originally applied for which now I understand is a perfect match to my interests and competence. I might have never applied for this position just because I was unfamiliar with the job title but it was the right step towards my career advancement. 2. Transparency & respect: WHH was the only organization to send me their compensation and benefit package together with the interview invitation. Having this info before the interview helped me make an informed decision and feel included. I applied for two positions at WHH and they were one of the few orgs to write me back respectfully explaining why I wasn't chosen. 3. Kind friendly helpful staff: Working for such a big org was challenging at first: numerous abbreviations different portals and internal systems for different tasks and so on  However my colleagues have supported me from day one and have been very patient with all newcomers. I never felt silly to ask for help and have always been encouraged to learn through questioning. 4. Hybrid work approach & flexible working hours,0.0014185238,0.007017814,0.9915637
1. Being part of a big Org such as WHH was my dream but it could also be lonely sometimes. Our department in general is new and therefore pretty small there's no designated lunchbreak and having flexible schedules means that there's little chance to get together with colleagues and enjoy a coffee break for example. However recently our HR team have been introducing more activities that allow coworkers to know one another and spend time outside work structure so I'm hopeful! 2. The onboarding live sessions are helpful but they could really use some development and be more practical and engaging.,0.88211274,0.116334155,0.0015531239

"I am working for 15 years here and have seen within the first 3 months how everything works here.   You start with Project Assistant and will get paid 1.600 EUR Netto. Then if they promote you you will be a ""Project Coordinator"" and have literally only EUR 200 Netto more on your account.  After 4 Years of wasting your time in this company you can be a ""project manager"" where you will have around 600 EUR more. This is information from colleagues working there.   There is a high fluctuation of employees at the Frankfurt School because smart people realize very quickly that there is no way achieve something at this company. They dont support your further education nor do they care about your personal feedback. I complaint so many times about my supervisor because of his bad management style but no one cared what i was feeling. The people at the ""top"" sit there for 20 years and they all support each other and dont care about their employees.   The job you are doing at this company are heavy administrative things: Writing invoices writing invitation letters to foreign participants booking hotels and company visits for foreign participants dealing literally with every problem these people have during their stay in Frankfurt booking seminar rooms and so on. Basically this is a secretary job no matter whether you have an MBA or not. There is nothing you learn from this company and there is no way you can grow personally. This is a waste of time and i WARN you dont work for this company.    The call themselves ""sustainable academy"" but what goes inside with regard to their employees is not sustainable at all everything is a lie !  I hope people read this before they think of working there",0.998926,0.000917604,0.00015638866

I was supported in my personal development concerning professional and social experience.,0.00027968077,0.00036083715,0.99935955
Due to the nature of Fraunhofer beeing a research institute some projects might take a change in their direction very late in development process or can also be stopped or totally fail. Many of these projects may only be completed for a (public) test phase and never comercial viability. This can be disappointing. When compared to industrial companies in the same field of expertise the payments can be lower.,0.9989281,0.0009309599,0.00014093243
Working for a software development area of the company I was able to learn a lot of new technologies I wouldn't have gotten at a more corporate time driven company.

Too much independence turned into a lack of support. I was left with zero training from the start thrown in the deep end as well as no long term support.

The pay is lower than what you would find at other companies especially considering the work the students do. The upside is that the Fraunhofer name is nice to have on a resume after graduating.  The student to fulltime employee ratio is a bit lopsided. Given the lack of work experience most students have things can get a bit chaotic at times.,0.99037105,0.009096662,0.00053236104

WiMis in Praedoc positions are exploited they are paid parttime to work more than full time on tasks that are not research/teaching related. The bureaucracy is extremely layered inefficient and not up to speed with the current agile framework. WiMis often need to take over administrative tasks due to the lack of qualified staff in the administration (even though there are three times as many).

 Treatment of graduate students depends entirely on their advisor and there are professors who regularly keep students working well past when they should have graduated just to have a fulltime postdoc for the price of a parttime phd student. The university has not adequately addressed complaints about this though the medical faculty is known to be particularly problematic.  Some people phd students and postdocs alike work for free when they run out of funding. (Postdocs can't be paid after 6 years unless they get a permanent position and phd students usually get 3 years of funding for an average time of 4 years until graduation with the expectation that the professor will take care of paying them from grant money from then until they graduate.)

It's an antiPersonalrat. To avoid getting sued they have no problem wasting time funds salaries. A common theme they have a rule that no hiring for less than 3 months but they can take literally months to process the hiring request then they end up refusing the hiring request because no thanks to them less than 3 months are available. Procurement is a Kafkan process you have the funds it belongs to your lab so you submit a request into SAP which resembles the void in many ways and stuff happen or don't but either way you don't know why. If you ask them they will tell you we are under staffed so we have few employees to process requests and if we push them they burnout out and leave the job then we are under staffed further more.

This is the kind of company that will squeeze everything out of you during your 6 months trial only to kick you out after.

They say they're open and want fresh ideas yet nobody that speaks their mind or offers a solution that's not thought by a manager will have a long life in this company.

 toxic environment and toxic people (a lot of issues with colleagues mocking each other in their backs comments about “other people being dumb” pointing fingers for any issues most of the times on the wrong person instead of trying to find solutions going to complain to management for things that shouldn’t be complained for (looking for someone to help outside of the team got me a complain to my manager from a colleague because I tried too hard at my job to find someone WILLING TO HELP because in this company they are not willing to help you PEOPLE DO NOT HELP EACH OTHER). Non stop passive aggressivity when it’s not clearly aggressive. Colleagues complaining all the time about the company and the fact that nothing works first meetings being just a presentation of what terrible is happening in the company. People telling you to contact someone “but idk if he’s still here because you know the life expectancy in this department is pretty non existent” that was told multiple times and from my first week because they fire or get tired of the toxic culture a lot. Clearly missing structure a sane culture and a management that knows how to handle TERRIBLE FEEDBACKS. I left because management told me they can’t change culture ok but when everyone is toxic like this do something instead of hoping to hire more toxic people fitting in. In the end they also fired my manager after only 2 months of being in the company but the email to announce his dismissal was clearly not normal as they mentioned publicly for the whole department to know that he was fired because “we didn’t like his work” that’s confidential info! I reported all the above to HR and even more and they will for sure do nothing.,0.9987502,0.0010957645,0.00015405667

Jacobs University has a great concept and living in a small community on a small campus with people from all over the world teaches you in many ways prepares you for a live traveling abroad or with international contacts and gives you friends for a life time. the amaying professor to student rate helps you in many cases: if you want to go abroad for a semester with recommendations and internships.,0.00022125876,0.0005918493,0.99918693
Due to the small size of the university not every major is offered and since the university is only 10 years old many things are still shaping.

with a heavy focus on math and theory an early and intensive exposition to research and a broad range of researchgroups the KIT is a very competitive place to study computer science. The faculty of CS is very open for example every researchtalk is announced and open to the students.

the CS building is very ugly. The bureaucracy is everywhere. The campus has so much potential but is in a very bad shape.,0.9989479,0.0008850563,0.0001670595
The KITCN is a great place for research. The laboratories are generally well equipped. There is easy access to basic equipment such as GCs FTIRs SEMs. Time for larger equipment such as NMRs Synchrotron measurements is difficult to obtain. There are a large number of great research colleagues so it is inspiring to be a part of that group. The expectation for researchers is approximately one peerreviewed paper per year. Working hours are flexible and up to 2 days per month can be taken off using overtime hours.,0.0003747542,0.00037933083,0.999246
Difficulties are likely institute specific. Since the combination of FZK with the Uni to KIT the working conditions have worsened and a large influx of new people has occurred. Several institutes received new bosses who are also professors. In many cases these institute directors are poorly equipped to manage large numbers of researchers and have too little time for their split activities. The KIT is moving more towards a university (student mill) than a research center. Thus PhD level researchers are not valued. Students will find positions and technicians don't seem to have suffered. Many employees are dissatisfied with the new contract conditions and the trend seems to be more work for less pay. PhD students should work more than full time but for 50 or 75% of the typical pay. Academic freedom used to be a plus but now you are just an expendable slave to the professor and shouldn't express independent thoughtdon't forget it.,0.9985771,0.0012928384,0.00012999143
I came to a professor and asked if I can work on a project I am interested in (which is vaguely related to what the institute does). He was ok with that :)  So:  I can work on a project I am interested in with scientific background but which can be used in praxis  I can work where I want (from home or at the institute ... or other places)  I can work when I want,0.00029067352,0.9963576,0.0033517394

As every postdoc knows the experience in working as a postdoc depends on how the professor you are working with and depend on is. I am quite fortunate on this respect. The rest of this review focuses on things I believe are common for all postdocs in LudwigMaximilans Universitaet. The facilities are excellent and very well managed. It is possible to develop good inhouse collaborations  many groups are among the world leaders in their own field. The good name of the University means it is a bit easier for your boss to win grants; besides German universities have a good habit of collaboration which fosters common projects from which everyone benefits. You get to learn German if you want (but you can do everything with English). Excellent seminaries. I know there is support and good possibilities for creating companies starting from scientific work made at the University but I am not informed on the details.,0.00050112244,0.0020453567,0.9974535
Libraries are scattered all over the city of Munich and lend books for a very short term (one week). The Physics library is not as large and complete as I expected it. It is very difficult (= almost impossible) to get to know what people next door are working on unless you read their papers (=as easy or as difficult as getting to know what anyone in the world is doing); but on the other hand around the world I have never found an University where people were readily open to intellectual exchange and of course everyone has their own ideas on why and how this happens.,0.99585414,0.0039783726,0.00016755021

Fulltime employment positions for PhD students are scarce in many fields (especially humanities).  You'll get only timelimited contract (usually 1 year) which have to be extended several times before you have a chance to finish your thesis.  Everything depends on your relationship with your PhD advisor / boss.  Much of the administrative branch (e.g. travel cost centre) is so bureaucratic and inefficient that it's at the same time hilarious and infuriating.,0.9990983,0.0007367953,0.00016497387

 Big focus on work/life balance. Take as much or little responsibility as you want get compensated well for the time you put in. Hours are flexible timezones are flexible holiday schedule is flexible. Competent diverse and fun team. Engineering tenure is quite long everyone is very knowledgeable and steadily improving. Everyone is incredibly proactive in sharing their knowledge and go indepth into discussions and code reviews while still being up for a long relaxing chat about things unrelated to work. Continuous learning. Employees are encouraged to take time to stay up to date with the industry discuss new trends internally and share new techniques with each other. Mission and ambition: The leadership is approachable and motivated the employees are driven the students are incredible. In other places engineering can often feel like you're just another cog in the machine but Minerva does everything it can to make you feel valued while allowing you to focus on realworld impact. Most engineers aren't just nerdy about tech but deeply care about education as well. Good compensation and benefits: Industrystandard compensation option choices and benefits like paid company trips flyins education budget etc. I haven't had a chance to see how  Efficiency and agency: Processes are kept efficient meetings are kept useful. Engineers get to have a good amount of input into product questions and novel ideas always meet open ears. Opportunity for growth: In my short tenure and through my review of Minerva's history there are a lot of good examples for growth opportunities within the company and leadership positions are filled from the inside. Highly diagonal jumps seem to be possible. My manager has been very supportive in thinking about growth opportunities. Overall it's been a joy to work here and I'm confident in the growing impact and success of the company.,0.0033056862,0.018682716,0.9780116

The cons have to do with value systems. I found the issues worthy of bailing but a lot of people take the pay and benefits and ride the wave to retirement. Leadership is delusional and the mission is falling apart after a very controversial and ineffective organizational transformation. Employees prefer to pay themselves big salaries and go on expensive retreats rather than increase the amount of grants given to grantees who do the actual human rights work. Promotions are only possible with extreme political maneuvering but if you make it to leadership you find there is a hierarchy of former and future government officials with questionable credentials. OSF is an incredibly bureaucratic institution so every decision takes weeks until proactive employees burn out. Ethics policies are ignored and grantmaking is almost 99% sole source (this is open knowledge so I'm not giving anything away here) so most program officers give funds directly into their personal networks which makes the organization fraught with corruption. This may not be an issue if leadership took notice and empowered investigations teams but findings of fraud or conflicts of interest are routinely ignored.

The learning rates are very high when working for TUD. The instutuion has a high reputation and workers are considered valuable by other institutions in research and industry. The university environment is extremely fruitful due to the fact that the university is diversified in all fields of research and teaching. Due to the transformation process of German universities there are opportunites to contribute to the creation of new structures and study programes.,0.0002989235,0.0004587873,0.9992423
"Bureaucratic burdens increased over the last few years from a slim administrative process towards more bureaucracy. Some of these changes however are not the responsibility of the TUD but state regulations. Furthermore albeit being one of the best research and teaching institutions in the country TUD increasingly lacks financial resources which creates some inflexibility in salaries particularly towards postdoctoral staff without ""professor"" status.",0.9985501,0.0011892986,0.00026056502

 There are many good German professors who studied in the renowned universities and came back to their region to work.  Secretaries and staff are friendly and many of them are English speaking.  Native and international students are very friendly and openminded.  There are many opportunities for international graduate students from Welcome Center and Graduate Academy for many aspects of professional and personal life.   The city is cheap enough for living so low PhD salaries (50%) would not harm your quality of life dramatically.   Flexible working hours leaves you some space for side activities.,0.00030089356,0.00037953354,0.99931955
 The traditional PhD supervision system leaves no room for students to get feedback from anybody other than their direct supervisor.  There is no concrete advisory board for PhD students in most departments.  The PhD students are basically isolated by their supervisor.   Professors often think they don't have to answer to anybody so the career of PhD students is not their main concern.   During the PhD interview the supervisor made many empty promises which ware mostly not kept.    The city is not international friendly at all!! There are many people who despise or (in the best case) ignore international talents. It means you are going to have a hard time finding opportunities in your social life.   The prospective job market is only good for some few disciplines like electronics and materials engineering.,0.9986292,0.00120283,0.00016802303

The International Secretariat in Berlin is unfortunately faltering. It's not a nice place to work with morale very low among the mostly lovely and hardworking colleagues. With the departure of the old senior management team in 2017 (who were no angels but compare favourably to the current crop) a new MD was brought on board. Unfortunately TI was not able to attract someone with commensurate skills and experience required for the role. She is neither a strong advocate for the cause nor a strong internal manager. In fact she appears to be weak on both fronts and therefore is very insecure in her position and does not trust anyone particularly longstanding knowledgeable staff who she seems to see as a threat. Therefore the organisational culture has become one  where mistrust of staff reigns and favouritism is the order of the day. The MD has surrounded herself with 'yes men and women' who do not dare to challenge her even in the face of incompetence. In the wake of accusations of bullying and harrassment the international oversight board has done little or nothing to address the ongoing issues. The future does not seem bright unless there is a change of leadership both at executive management level and at the level of the international board.,0.99838424,0.0014437556,0.00017197672

Transparency International has gone through a major reshaping of its internal management to try and diminish the bureaucracy and get the wellpaid senior levels to provide less bla bla bla and more hands  on contribution. Despite the effort the organization is still poorly managed and the senior management is totally unfit to keep the pace of more structured international NGOs. Personnell is recruited withour a clear idea of how to benefit from it sometimes to fill in urgent needs for project implementation and offering poor career perspectives. Additionally despite transparency and ethics shall be important internally as well as externally former employees reported several cases of unfair treatements nontransparent hiring processes and few cases of work harrassment.,0.998599,0.001251001,0.00015003102

"In practise however the organisation has failed to act on the big issues of the day. Its silent on contoversial issues like wikileaks because the movement is still being run by a small group of old rich white men who created TI 20 years ago. Most of the work is actually very bureaucratic: meetings budgets etc. the leadership are constantly revisiting the strategy without anything ever really changing except for a small group of people getting promoted over and over again. Which is the biggest problem: too many ""yes men"" and too many workshops and meetings but not enough doers. If you dont fit into a ""clique"" and have someone high up on your side you wont go far. New ideas are often not welcome. Management are Unaccountable and very defensive about criticism and complaints.  moral of midlevel staff is extremely low.",0.99878675,0.00106789,0.00014540118

Run by a Politburustyle Management Group. You can work yourself into the ground for the organization but if you fail to suck up to (or flirt with) these people you are going nowhere. They keep their own records on who they like and who they don't. This means managers tend to tow the party line because they know persons who speak their minds are getting blacklisted. This wouldnt be so different from other places if it was not from the fact that these people are neither good managers nor good activists. They are only good at holding meetings and designing incomprehensible bureaucratic procedures. As a result most of the daily work of the organization is removed from the outside world. Experts are not welcome (they make the bosses insecure): the less you know about corruption the better. There is an incredible turnover that sees staff either leave within 6 months or stay forever because they dont want to leave Berlin. Are you a misogynist and a bully you will fit right in. Otherwise steer clear.,0.9982815,0.0015700272,0.00014856271

Overbearing hierarchy that stiffles innovation and tends to micromanage. Lack of clear priorities for the organisation resulting in financial and human resources being spread too thin.

Neither  the leadership nor the  management are  good communicators.  They  don't  seem to interact  with the staff or not being consultative.

Although the Secretariat is said to be stabalizing from the change process chaos prevails. There are no clear decisionmaking processes important information is not coherently communicated from management and the Secretariat is lacking a sense of vision and mission.

TI’s downfall started in 2016 with its restructuring process. Efforts to recover the institution since then keep failing as personal agendas and incompetencies take a lead over institutional interests and real priorities. Present executive leadership is clearly not cut out to lead an advocacy NGO. She is out of depth  extremely old school in her approaches and disturbingly unethical. Despite being an organisation promoting transparency and accountability the senior management team (SMT) was selected without due process or having terms of reference. When the managers were appointed the favourites of the leadership were told before the process that they were  earmarked for the positions. Some potential candidates were even reprimanded and told not to apply for any managerial positions within the organisation. Favouritism at its best paving the way for command and control. So much for the meritocracy  that TI preaches about!   All these resulted in a few incompetent and inexperience staff members getting appointed to the SMT. Their lack of skills unprofessional and unethical conduct unfortunately are ruining this organisation. The relatively younger female SMT member even carries no uneasiness to air her racial prejudices  or bad mouth about other staff members. The only way to survive within the organisation is to declare unwavering support to the SMT. Then you will be rewarded despite lack of performances in the past or serious allegations against ethical conduct within the organisation. So for a very few this is the way to survive.  There is no institutional performance evaluation in the organisation at present.   Some staff members questioned the leadership about their conduct in staff meetings. They were simply told  leave the organisation if you are unhappy.  Currently there  is no institutional or leadership vision for TI. Despite a strategy approved by its membership running up to 2020 SMT turns around priorities placing personal agendas at the forefront beyond institutional interests.   A horde of competent and experience staff members have left in the recent past or in the process of leaving. It is a public secret within the organisation that every other person is looking for a job to leave.   What is happening within TI at present is truly unbelievable.  I doubt that the international board of this organisation cares. A classic example of how ambitions of politics and small privileges could take precedence over what is expected from  an oversight body.   A recent BBC article revealed what was happening  within Amnesty International Secretariat.

Universities feel like they are based on higher values than profit which I assume they basically are. They are based on genuine scientific interests. I appreciate that a lot. And it was probably the biggest reason I wanted to keep on working at a university.  Basically I was happy with the usual work situation.,0.01135808,0.7440444,0.24459751
The problem for me was that as a research fellow you get only a part time job at universities. This is standard and not the fault of the university.  But it is one main reason I decided to stay away from the academic research path and become a programmer for companies. I had to get a more normal income due to financial problems.  Another reason is that there are not many job opportunities at universities after the PhD. So I had to change my path anyway and it seemed better to do it rather early than later in life.  Right now I would feel uncomfortably to recommend an academic path if you are looking for a financially at least average life.  I don't regret changing my path.,0.828182,0.17139141,0.0004265899
As the university is rather small the contact is very personal on all levels which makes it easy to experiences the latest science hands on.

On the other hand dude to the size the university is also limited in terms of topics being available.

The job is interesting you learn a lot and then you get a PhD degree. In spite of the job contract you also register in the university so you also get student benefits such as for public transportarion. We have a lot of holidays (6 weeks) which we can take anytime in the year all together or dividided by days weeks...as you like.

You are expected to work far more than 8 hours a day (10 hours in average some days more) though you only get paid for 5 hours (TVL 13 65%).

 Depending on the department funding for your PhD position might be an issue. Many contracts are for 3 years if you are lucky. Much shorter contracts are often offered.   Many departments are large.

If you want to live in Europe while having access to American conveniences while working in a challenging and rewarding job and have access to a free education then work for  UMUC Europe. The bulk of administrative jobs are in Germany and there are field jobs all over Europe where there are military bases. Benefits are great timeoff medical retirement and FREE education. Pay is ok because it is taxfree.,0.00043874173,0.00062006473,0.99894124
Due to the military drawdown and the changing educational industry UMUC Europe is undergoing a lot of changes. Part of this restructuring resulted in laying off whole departments and asking for everyone to reapply for their own jobs with more responsibility and less pay. As a result they've lost a lot of valuable employees kept the ones too incompetent to work anywhere else.,0.9988477,0.0010192157,0.00013297642

Programs are in transition so syllabi and textbooks can be out of sync. Courses can be cancelled at the last minute after instructors have invested considerable preparation time. Teaching semester may extend beyond the end of the contract with no compensation for the extra work. No guidance regarding how to spend facetoface time which must be delivered in 8hour blocks of time.,0.9991302,0.00070236495,0.00016750065

Let's be honest about UMUC. It exists only to separate service members veterans and their families from their Federal tuition assistance and G.I. Bill money.  And do so as cheaply as possible.  There is a lot of smoke and mirrors about how this isn't sobut go ahead give it a try.  Adjunct faculty are nothing but a pool of qualified teachers that they can call at their convenience to teach a class for a pittance.  They will keep you on the hook but you might not get a call to teach for years. But you will be expected to keep current on an endless list of paperwork and training. On your time.  This place is a jokenot a respectable school and certainly not a recommended employer.,0.9986274,0.0011662017,0.00020638254

A culture of nepotism and favoritism.  Top heavy management structure that is slow to make changes . The implicit understanding that your job would be in danger if you complained.

OU is a wonderful organization that lends to its employees a large amount of training in a diverse set of higher education skills. You also have plenty of opportunity to gain managerial experience and training experience. They truly value their students' experiences and strive to maintain the highest level of educational integrity in the degree programs they offer both on campus and worldwide through their military contracts. Employees are made to feel as though their opinions are valued their expertise upheld and that the entirety of OU truly cares.  There is also the wonderful tuition waiver available to staff that is a great benefit to those looking to pursue education opportunities through OU while employed with them.   The greatest benefit of working for the university or any university for that matter is the wonderful worklife balance. There were plenty of paid days off plenty of flexibility and just a wonderful balance all around.,0.0002473034,0.0002315726,0.99952114
The biggest con with OU (Europe) is that staff that is not on the main campus has an incredible amount of difficulty assisting students with everyday questions. This is due to mainly to the fact that staff in Europe are constantly operating 7 hours ahead of the main campus in Norman OK. This time gap is an extreme impediment to daily operations.  This is further aggravated by the ridiculous rule that staff abroad cannot call themselves advisors even though that is exactly what they provide to their student population daily. This creates many impediments to both students and staff.   There is also an issue where there is absolutely no marketing budget. Staff especially in Europe are expected to market heavily so as to get more students in the door yet are not provided with a budget that can assist in those ventures. Often staff are having to make their own materials pay out of pocket or simply go without. This causes great marketing gaps between OU and the other institutions competing with them for students. While the university does send materials to utilize they are never enough and are not dynamic enough to encompass all of the marketing opportunities available. More often than not it simply leaves the university not seizing all the opportunities available to them.   Lastly there is a lack in professional development for staff. Sadly even when staff member utilize the tuition waiver available to obtain degrees or certificates their only opportunity for career growth is outside the organization. There is extremely limited upward mobility when working for OU overseas.,0.99890554,0.0009467409,0.0001476547
