The atmosphere is usually challenging and at the same time demanding. It's not surprising to see many young professionals working in this environment and the international options are there for those staying longer. Comparing it with other office related jobs you will find better salary offers, but you would be hard pressed to find a better working culture somewhere else. There is a high sense of companionship between offices and countries, which makes working long hours or getting up early for a flight much easier to cope.", "cons": "Work life balance will be the hardest to keep up, especially during high seasons. Be prepared to work over hours and weekends frequently. Company culture is not for everyone."}]]
