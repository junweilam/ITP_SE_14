Everywhere there are bright scientists, both PIs and students. Working at Charite is really interesting for a scientist.

However, going through official channels to buy a laptop or even a paper notebook can be incredibly frustrating. Same with conferences, travels, books, lab equipment, consumables etc.etc. Everything takes a lot of time and requires a lot of effort on your part, esp. filling out puzzling forms, mostly in German and using weird internal IT systems or, at best, SAP. Some obstacles remain insurmountable. You have to participate in mandatory online trainings aimed mostly at nurses and technical staff, and mostly in German. In general, unlike at pure research institutions, ability to speak German is much more important here. Internet access and usage is severly restricted (again, forms, forms, forms), mostly because of the tons of sensitive patient data, but annoying nonetheless. A lot of the IT infrastructure is obsolete, or in a semi-working condition. The intranet pages are a horror. Getting a permanent position is unlikely. PI's are usually older white male Germans. Some of them can be really full of themselves. Living in Berlin can be quite expensive, especially renting an appartment within a reasonable commuting time. Charite itself is not one campus, but multiple sites spread throughout whole Berlin, so depending on where you work you may have a very different experience of living."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "OK...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Phd Student Researcher in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Prestige Location Contacts Price Mensa", "cons": "Funding Job opportunities Hierarchy Bureaucracy No innovation mindset"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Working Student in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Very welcoming colleagues. * High learning curve.", "cons": "* Delayed operations from the administrative and bureaucracy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "No major complaints", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "salary according to TV\u00f6D.

However, going through official channels to buy a laptop or even a paper notebook can be incredibly frustrating. Same with conferences, travels, books, lab equipment, consumables etc.etc. Everything takes a lot of time and requires a lot of effort on your part, esp. filling out puzzling forms, mostly in German and using weird internal IT systems or, at best, SAP. Some obstacles remain insurmountable. You have to participate in mandatory online trainings aimed mostly at nurses and technical staff, and mostly in German. In general, unlike at pure research institutions, ability to speak German is much more important here. Internet access and usage is severly restricted (again, forms, forms, forms), mostly because of the tons of sensitive patient data, but annoying nonetheless. A lot of the IT infrastructure is obsolete, or in a semi-working condition. The intranet pages are a horror. Getting a permanent position is unlikely. PI's are usually older white male Germans. Some of them can be really full of themselves. Living in Berlin can be quite expensive, especially renting an appartment within a reasonable commuting time. Charite itself is not one campus, but multiple sites spread throughout whole Berlin, so depending on where you work you may have a very different experience of living."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "OK...", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Phd Student Researcher in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Prestige Location Contacts Price Mensa", "cons": "Funding Job opportunities Hierarchy Bureaucracy No innovation mindset"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Working Student in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* Very welcoming colleagues. * High learning curve.", "cons": "* Delayed operations from the administrative and bureaucracy."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "No major complaints", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "salary according to TV\u00f6D.
