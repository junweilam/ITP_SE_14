Procurement is a Kafkan process, you have the funds, it belongs to your lab, so you submit a request into SAP, which resembles the void in many ways, and stuff happen or don't, but either way you don't know why. If you ask them, they will tell you we are under staffed, so we have few employees to process requests, and if we push them they burnout out and leave the job, then we are under staffed further more.
