Strong interview skills & analysis: they assessed my expertise and suggested me a different position than what I originally applied for, which now I understand is a perfect match to my interests and competence. I might have never applied for this position just because I was unfamiliar with the job title, but it was the right step towards my career advancement. 2. Transparency & respect: WHH was the only organization to send me their compensation and benefit package together with the interview invitation. Having this info before the interview helped me make an informed decision and feel included. I applied for two positions at WHH and they were one of the few orgs to write me back respectfully explaining why I wasn't chosen. 3. Kind, friendly, helpful staff: Working for such a big org was challenging at first: numerous abbreviations, different portals and internal systems for different tasks, and so on - However, my colleagues have supported me from day one and have been very patient with all newcomers. I never felt silly to ask for help and have always been encouraged to learn through questioning. 4. Hybrid work approach & flexible working hours", "cons": "1. Being part of a big Org such as WHH was my dream but it could also be lonely sometimes. Our department in general is new and therefore pretty small, there's no designated lunchbreak, and having flexible schedules means that there's little chance to get together with colleagues and enjoy a coffee break for example. However, recently our HR team have been introducing more activities that allow coworkers to know one another and spend time outside work structure, so I'm hopeful! 2. The onboarding live sessions are helpful but they could really use some development and be more practical and engaging."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Legal Assistant in Bonn", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best people ever, work life balance is great", "cons": "Salary should be corrected according to the economic situation"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "give the best on development programme", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Sept 2022", "job_title": "Head of Projects in Bonn", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great support \ngreat innovation spirit", "cons": "hierarchy too narrow\nlittle chance of career advancement\nlittle chance of increasing remuneration"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Student Assistent", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Student Assistant in Bonn", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Supportive team \r\n- Interesting tasks \r\n- Opportunities for self-growth", "cons": "- wish better support from HR department"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Nov 2016", "job_title": " in Bonn", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- friendly colleagues\r\n- good working environment\r\n- a job that means something\r\n- chance to travel the world", "cons": "- project are often in crisis areas and bear a certain risk\r\n- you can earn more working for Goldman Sachs or the UN"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great work atmosphere", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 May 2020", "job_title": "Communications in Berlin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "meaningful job, fair pay, family-friendly", "cons": "hierarchical, not enough women in positions of power"}], [], []]
