You also have plenty of opportunity to gain managerial experience and training experience. They truly value their students' experiences and strive to maintain the highest level of educational integrity in the degree programs they offer, both on campus and worldwide through their military contracts. Employees are made to feel as though their opinions are valued, their expertise upheld, and that the entirety of OU truly cares.\r\n\r\nThere is also the wonderful tuition waiver available to staff that is a great benefit to those looking to pursue education opportunities through OU while employed with them. \r\n\r\nThe greatest benefit of working for the university, or any university for that matter, is the wonderful work-life balance. There were plenty of paid days off, plenty of flexibility, and just a wonderful balance all around.", "cons": "The biggest con with OU (Europe) is that staff that is not on the main campus has an incredible amount of difficulty assisting students with everyday questions. This is due to mainly to the fact that staff in Europe are constantly operating 7 hours ahead of the main campus in Norman, OK. This time gap is an extreme impediment to daily operations.  This is further aggravated by the ridiculous rule that staff abroad cannot call themselves advisors even though that is exactly what they provide to their student population daily. This creates many impediments to both students and staff. \r\n\r\nThere is also an issue where there is absolutely no marketing budget. Staff, especially in Europe, are expected to market heavily so as to get more students in the door, yet are not provided with a budget that can assist in those ventures. Often staff are having to make their own materials, pay out of pocket, or simply go without. This causes great marketing gaps between OU and the other institutions competing with them for students. While the university does send materials to utilize, they are never enough and are not dynamic enough to encompass all of the marketing opportunities available. More often than not it simply leaves the university not seizing all the opportunities available to them. \r\n\r\nLastly, there is a lack in professional development for staff. Sadly, even when staff member utilize the tuition waiver available to obtain degrees or certificates, their only opportunity for career growth is outside the organization. There is extremely limited upward mobility when working for OU overseas."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great University", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Aug 2014", "job_title": "Director in Ramstein-Miesenbach", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly, caring, and knowledgeable atmosphere.
