The campus of AUIB boasts beautiful greenery flowers and trees that provide a peaceful atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The university provides free bicycles and buses allowing staff to take full advantage of these tranquil surroundings. Another unique aspect of AUIB is its architectural legacy. The campus includes repurposed palaces from the era of the Ba'ath party which have now been transformed into educational spaces. The exterior architecture of these former political palaces is visually striking. The aim to uplift the educational standard in the country is indeed a laudable mission undertaken by the owning family. The intention to provide an international standard of education in Iraq is an admirable objective which brings hope for the future of the nation's youth. The campus has serene lakes and an abundance of birdlife providing a serene environment conducive to reflection and creativity. The harmony of nature amidst the educational structures makes for a unique blend of tranquillity and scholarly pursuit. The institution's reputation and practices are rooted more locally diverging from those typically associated with American academic institutions.,0.00029641713,0.0012157867,0.99848783
Unfair sudden decrease happened in all salaries. The announcement of a 20% salary reduction due to new taxes was not only poorly timed but also unjust. Unlike many international organisations AUIB passed the tax burden onto its employees directly affecting their income. The lack of prior notice left many employees stranded unable to make timely decisions about their employment status.  At AUIB rumours and gossips often serve as the primary mode of communication rather than direct professional exchanges. It is disheartening to discover changes concerning one's employment status from hearsay rather than an official communication. This lack of transparency is bad planning.,0.9990503,0.0008002664,0.00014939762

AUIB's vision is to transform education in Iraq This needs a dedicated and experienced team. The Founder and President are always supportive to any project that will realize the vision. What makes AUIB a wonderful place to work at is the that 99% of faculty and staff are committed to AUIB's vision they are team players and work with dedication. The students are the bright young minds of Iraq. Many times I hear  our students are fantastic from faculty and ELA instructors. As employee: no stone is left untouched to make life easy and enjoyable. The safety of expats are given priority always in armored vehicles and with wonderful security team. Traveling out of the country the security team take care of you until you are booked in. Everyone get VIP treatment. Health insurance: fully staffed clinic on campus insurance for outside and inside Iraq in times when emergencies happened the bill was paid by the Founding Family. Every employee is treated as a family member. Housing: top of the range modern housing. All utilities are paid for by AUIB. Maintenance issues are taken care of within hours of reporting. Furnishings and finishings are high end no costs were spared. Gym: excellent fully equipped gym with table tennis darts billiard tables etc. Airconned free water supply free membership. Food court: variety of food outlets traditional Iraq food fast foods. Grocery store: stocks everything you need from international and national brands. Fresh vegetables and good cuts of meat. Health foods organic vegan supplies as well. If you need anything the staff will gladly order and deliver to you. AUIB club: luxurious setting with swimming pool excellent food you get discounts of up to 45% theme nights quiz nights. This is where everyone meets after a long day. Management: as a start up changing educational landscape merging American Style educational style with Iraqi education is not easy. There are many challenges from legislative to logistics merging enrollment methods aligning curriculums hiring according to prescribed registration rules in Iraq etc. The management team has to be light on their feet to address external as well as internal issues. The team therefor has to be well educated global experience team players and team builders. Not everyone that was hired could adapt to these challenges. Add covid and world recession and only the best will survive. The President is the Founding President the Founder and his family is the sole supporter of the project  they have what it takes not only to make it work but to make it success. The business structure: policies and SOPs are in place the Iraqi labour is followed to the T. Several approval steps have all checks and balances in place. Personal development is encouraged many events are held on campus for participation. Further studies are encouraged supported and approved. The success of AUIB is possible because the Founder and President has a balanced working relationship they compliment each other professionally. To have a good sense of humor is very important. The President keeps the team in a light heart the is excellent for creating a good work environment. You always leave a meeting at the President's office with a smile on your face.,0.3298889,0.42429742,0.2458137
There are always a small group of people that could not make it at AUIB. These are the ones that did not have what it takes to operate in a fast changing high pressured environment. Your work place is your choice: not a good fit find a good fit.,0.9988563,0.0009928389,0.00015091241
