It is difficult to find cons for the Global Compact in Denmark. For some one thing could however be perceived as slightly negative. As the secretariat is small (around 14 people) you should be prepared to (in rare occasions) take on tasks not 100% linked to your field if the secretariat is executing a large event. However management is always respectful and easily approachable if you wish not to participate in those tasks.,0.88213015,0.1173662,0.00050359446

Not paying taxes makes one an outcast of Danish society in a few ways  impossible to get a decent mortgage no tax deductions among others.  Very hierarchical structure to work.

Sometimes I faced situations where the red tape made the workflow slower and difficult. The hierarchy is a very strong concept in this organization and it is necessary to go through many steps until reaching the object set.

The system of management is completely broken at all levels. Technical staff are promoted into management roles with no management skills at all. Archaic systems are made more unbearable by a hierarchical system separating technical staff from 'support' staff even in extremely taxing administrative positions with huge responsibility without which the Organization would not operate. Focus on holding meetings and producing reports without any consideration of how their work time and precious money should be spent most effectively.  Work life balance is terrible unless you flat out refuse and insist on leaving  if you show any inclination to work hard it will be taken advantage of to burnout and beyond.,0.9989754,0.0008540778,0.00017051745
