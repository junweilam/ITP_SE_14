Extreme focus on growth/money poor compensation for staff lack of focus on programme quality or impact on the vulnerable misrepresents terrible projects to donors to trick them into continued funding (this is also the donor's fault). A large portion of senior management is terrible  they come off as egotistical and growth oriented and without true interest in humanitarian principles. Overworking is the norm HR is basically forced to erase any evidence of overworking on time sheets. Many practices forced upon staff are borderline illegal and definitely unethical.,0.9990608,0.00078360236,0.00015558054

High staff turnover also at senior incountry level support from HQ and country office cannot always be ensured because of understaffing.

ACF allowed me to grow professionally and humanly. I had amazing experiences on the field. Thanks to colleagues' trust commitment and professionalism I found a professional life balance for the 1st time in my life. I had the chance also to explore and be involved in a number of activities beyond the scope of my own initial expertise.

Great staff professors very supportive and super friendly. Work life balance is amazing. Not to mention 38 hour working week in France which is mandatory. If you work overtime you must take time off to 'recuperate' those days.  You have 56 weeks vacation time even when you just come on board. Autonomy is great  very entrepreneurial environment. Fontainebleau is a beautiful small french village not too far from Paris and Singapore is also fantastic. Both campuses/offices are very nice and modern with top notch facilities. You also have onsite cafeteria gym book store newspapers office supplies all on campus.,0.0002691698,0.00028382242,0.99944705
If you are a city person you are working in a small village in the forest. Beautiful but it would be nice if it was a little closer to paris (it's about 65 km but traffic is a nightmare and the school is not walking distance from the train station).  No major pay increases or promotions given regularly. Most people stay in the same roles for a number of years. However people do switch over to different deparments quite frequently.,0.009325657,0.98931247,0.0013619297
Relaxed atmosphere. Great food in the cafeteria. International atmosphere. Beautiful campus in France with a forest nearby. NICEST most considerate people I've ever worked with. It's a great starter job to put the name on your CV. Great place for moms who need flexible hours and can come/leave at a consistent time every day. Lots of employees can move horizontally to different departments so opportunities for change (although it's rarely vertical change). Since it's in France 5 vacation weeks per year and NO pressure to stay late.,0.00029575385,0.00025979074,0.9994444
Lack of role definition means many employees slack off with no repercussions. If you're type B it's great...but if you're ambitious it's a nightmare. HR is not transparent with hirinf/promotion potential/salaries. No communication between upper management and employees. NO potential for growth. No skill development.

They further denied it by certified letter but as soon as I involved a lawyer they paid within a few days without further argument.   Fontainebleau is very far from the Paris metropolitan area and train cancellations and delays are a big problem.

The cardinal sins of all big organizations going sideways are there: Organization is completely immune to any internal criticism there is no organizationwide consultation.  Management in HQ is detached from the field (which is a standard in the industry) and surrounded by yesmen.   It's a great job you won't be recognized for as generally the HR policies are lacking. Career progression is haphazard and largely depends on whom you know.  Working atmosphere depends on management and there are few good managers around.

Maybe back in the day this organization meant something but today calling it organization is over rated.  You need to be organized to be an organization.  MSFF works in developed countries where they get away with plenty of discrimination local vs international.  I was surprised how few knowledgeable international workers in this organization and due to invisible wall the heads created between local vs international the local workers are typically unproductive.  I understand the salary difference between local vs international but we are talking about treatment differences and difference in procedure for example if local worker screws up 200$ item he nearly gets fired while the international worker can order an item for 1000$ and not use it and it ends up as dead weight and end of story.  If your local employer you will get sick from the unfair treatment.  Also if by any change you are local employer and want to fix things they will hire and international manager to be your manager so he can get all the credit and he wont learn what your doing or do any of it he will be just your manager.  Also huge preference for France software  and France  everything made (legal money laundering) even if it was not in place or not the proper tool they hire France team to work on macros for excel.  2017 and they use EXCEL and MACROS and they have developer team in France for this.  All other tools are also mainly sources from France even if you live in country where french language is insignificant and not even close to secondary language but we have to use it and the main interface is in french  You will never be important in this organization no matter how hard you work if you are local nationality.,0.9982457,0.0016089302,0.00014547179
