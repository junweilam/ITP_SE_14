Arrogance and insecurity abound, completely disorganized. Not enough studio space and school is still in recovery from recent legal imbroglio. Not everyone teaching or in management has hands-on design experience or a design education and there is consequentially some non sequitur design discussion and/or inappropriate critique input. Unprofessional.\r\n\r\nSchool's major strength borrows from Paris location which is not enough given the tuition students pay. Unclear division of labor. Fear of being fired rather than love of one's work seems to be main m.o."}]]
