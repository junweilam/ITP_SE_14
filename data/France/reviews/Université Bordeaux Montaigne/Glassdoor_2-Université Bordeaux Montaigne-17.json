No negotiation of terms of appointment. No choice of institution. Everything good or bad is more or less the same throughout the French academic system!!! And it's mostly BAD and getting wore: low salaries and benefits, no research money, no sabbaticals, very heavy workloads. A French Associate Professor is on the same salary as a schoolteacher, but later... A French Full Professor makes 30-40% less than a beginning  Assistant Professor in the US. Cannot rent a small 2br apartment in Paris."}]]
