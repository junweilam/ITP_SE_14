AHF is swift/nimble in its response. While the WHO was still debating on whether to declare the Covid-19 as a Pandemic, AHF was already calling for it be declared a pandemic. AHF has transformed from an organisation that just deals with HIV but is not shy to take on any disease that threatens humanity. Case in point is the Ebola and more recently the Covid-19. I am so proud to be associated with such an organisation.", "cons": "I do not regret joining such a vibrant organisation."}]]
