HR department barely exists in HQ  basically a recruiting machine. No attention given to real HR issues such as performance management capacity building work/life balance. High turnover makes it difficult to be productive and efficient.  Management in HQ make snap judgements on employees. If the judgment is negative often times the person is pushed out in a very unprofessional manner. Management comes off as being heartless. Too much focus on what donors want and not what beneficiaries want.  Work/life balance is nonexistent. Extremely late work hours high stress environment when it is unnecessary.,0.9989618,0.000886999,0.00015123583

Over complicated processes and too narrow authorities that shows distrust on management.

The Group's standard of suspicion and level of distrust on local management often results loosing trustworthy and competent people without even a reason known to local management.   Career of taltented and competent people got compromised and sacrificed due to unsettling and often complicated reorganizations by Group Management which often causes hiding competence over diplomacy and just long but unbeneficial experiences this is the very reason that none from Pakistan Office has moved ahead in career on any international position over more than 3 decades.

 Management is living in decades back time.  Socalled HR organization. Infact it's a oneman show runs by MD.  High rate of professional jealousy and politics among senior management and staff suffers after all.  Several new techbased solutions are being introduced in the name of streamlining the work and better productivity. The reality is they are slowing down the work as many employees are not techsavvy even management knows nothing of technology. Employees are forced to do double work: one on techplatforms and then manual workflows for approval (paperwork).  MD can fire anyone anytime without even issuing notice or serving onemonth notice period.  Lack of decision making authority or ability. Senior management fears of MD and everyone wants someone else in management to take decision to remain on safe side.  Fingerpointing. Everyone tries to blame other.  If you are good at work and one of your team member is incompetent but in good book of MD you're in serious trouble. You would have to work not only yours but also of your incompetent teammate. Your teammate will go on time each day and you would have to do over time to get work done.,0.99812573,0.0017196605,0.0001545407

In an organization and particularly in the emergency programme like Polio it’s the manager who can get a below average worker deliver outstanding and it’s a manager who can make an outstanding worker below average. Outstanding organizations provide conducive and professional environment to their employees and with grief and sorrow I wish to inform you that the same is getting worst in this organization. Favoritism autocratic culture and job insecurity is actively prevailing which is resulting in demotivating the employees. Dirty politics is going on. low competency females have given an un due edge because of their closeness to the programme manager. Managers think that they have hired the staff as their personal servants. Admin head leading the technical staff.,0.99773836,0.0019841525,0.0002774629
