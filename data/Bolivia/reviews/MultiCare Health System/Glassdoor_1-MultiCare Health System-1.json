EMR is good. Various locations for lateral moves. Some very nice office staff.", "cons": "Not patient focused.  Burn out employees.  They bend the rules of Medicare.  Caseloads so high you are unable to give quality care.  They focus on quantity most.  Complete disconnect by management on the time it takes to do the job.  Many staff do charting on their own time because they are overloaded.   Constant pressure to do more every day. Your patients are given away to assistants regularly so PT's can do more admits.  Very high acuity patients that should have nurse admits vs PT. Way too many meetings.  Difficult to get time off approved.  Management works for corporate, does not support employees. Moral is low. My spirit as a PT was nearly broken there."}]]
