Danish Refugee Council (DRC) works with internally displaced persons (IDPs) in different parts of the world.

DRC is a key members of the humanitarian community a leader of groups of International NGOs.  As such DRC is a leader of determining standards and advocacy.  This can mean that going out alone to address issues or to take the government to task may not be the way to operate. DRC is not into unilateral denunciation for example. Protection an area in which DRC is an undisputed leader requires a fine balance between different operating principles depending on the context and this can be frustrating to some staff members.,0.995707,0.004120597,0.00017250833

Unprincipled professionally shallow parochial in their management. I started working with them attracted by their reputation. However what that reputation does not mention is the skyhigh turn over of expat staff due to poor management frustration with decisionmaking processes at senior level and the clear protectionism exercised by the Danes in the team. Very nontransparent and all good Scandinavian principles about equality participation worker rights etc. went through the window the moment DRC step out of Denmark. I still wonder how donors keep giving funds to this organization although I understand why serious ones like DFID USAID etc. would not entertain the idea of dumping their funds on that bottomless pit.,0.99840635,0.0014108804,0.00018283642
