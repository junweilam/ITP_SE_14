There is absolutely no better way to understand the workings of international refugee law without seeing it first hand and no better way to learn to appreciate the strength and resolve of a refugee without hearing their story in person in their native language. I was so proud of my supervisors my work and my colleagues. I was stretched and challenged in ways that are very uncommon for recent law school graduates; working for Asylum Access was the perfect way to launch my legal career.,0.0060022,0.015052029,0.9789458
It was financially difficult to work abroad without compensation but well worth it. By it's very nature the VLA position is one of in depth training and onceinalifetime experiences. It taught me a great many lessons and skills that helped me find the right position after returning from my time in Quito. I also think it is wise to require a 6 month commitment but not to encourage a stay much longer than that (as a VLA).,0.010278333,0.9684314,0.021290254
I've worked with Asylum Access Headquarters (HQ) for four years now and in that time I've witnessed an impressive growth spurt as the organization's expanded to several new countries. Through the process I've never seen a team work so hard to offer its employees the highest quality support and benefits possible.  I'll admit in the beginning the pay was low and benefits were few. But the organization's model and strategic approach is solid. The people I have had the pleasure to work with are honest downtoearth dedicated communicative and extremely professional.  After sticking with Asylum Access HQ for four years it's really paying off. My job description and salary have been improved significantly based on my interests and needs. I can work remotely and still feel like I'm part of a team. Finally I feel like there is still a lot of room to grow within the organization in the years to come and I definitely can't complain about the amount of paid time off we get.,0.010756247,0.04286007,0.9463837
 It can be hard to feel connected with staff and volunteers in other countries and their achievements.   In my line of work and likely because I work remotely there is a lot of computer time which is exhausting.  Late night meetings with our team in other timezones sometimes make it difficult to maintain a work/life balance. That said there is flexibility around work schedules.,0.9986161,0.0012069221,0.00017698131
This internship offered me the chance to gain experience and skills in a wide variety of different tasks in communications and development.  My managers were friendly and supportive always providing clear guidance on what was needed and were available when I gad questions. They provided constructive and encouraging feedback after I completed work. The work environment is professional but relaxed and I had tge chance to meet and work with people from diverse countries.  Its a great place to meet friends. Also with the alumni network you can get updates about upcoming job vacancies in the field. Overall I think it is an internship where you can get hands on experience in a growing international organization doing very worthwhile work.,0.00020538087,0.00026660282,0.99952805
Quite a lot of independent working is required so using your initiative is necessary. As a growing organization many staff are very busy causing strain and difficulties in retention.

As a young professional working at Sun Mountain was an excellent opportunity to get involved in important environmental and development projects. The team at Sun Mountain was welcoming and encouraging.  Since the first moment I felt that I was part of a closelyknit group of talented professionals that strove to create synergistic products.  They provided clear expectations and they gave me expanded latitude to pursue my passions. They provided all the resources so that I could maximize my potential.  They supported my initiatives investing heavily in my training and my professional development.  The work environment in Sun Mountain is innovative by nature and requires a great deal of initiative.  From weekly team meetings with banana splits at the office in Quito to exploring the beauty of the southern Andes on a mountain bike after an intense week of cuttingedge work assessing floodmitigation strategies in Bolivia.  From feeling the uncertainty of families affected by natural disasters to designing projects that will enhance mobility and reduce air pollution in large cities.  The range of experiences and projects we worked on at Sun Mountain expanded my horizons and motivated me to dream big and pursue these dreams.

With great pleasure I'm writing this review today . Working at Sun Mountain International under Scott's leadership was a very professional and enlightening  experience . Professional because every team member did very high quality research thanks to well organize and high quality research methods that the company provided us.  Also it was an enlightening experience because we had the chance to see our research be applied in real life situation and make us realize how useful our work was. All of these was only possible under the leadership of Scott Solberg that was the glue that made everyone worked at its best and made the working environment very pleasant and interesting .

The growth opportunities for early career professionals at SMTN are very uncommon in larger organizations offering significant responsibility relatively quickly. Many staff have gone on to work in leading international development organizations.  Specifically for those interested in sustainable development SMTN offers great opportunities for motivated professionals to work at the intersection of environment and development on projects with international NGOs and donors.   Sun Mountain actively seeks to create opportunities for early career professionals to be part of the team and to actively participate in projects including engaging with clients and traveling to the field.   Furthermore there is a wide array of projects and SMTN management seeks opportunities for staff to work on a diverse set of projects providing excellent professional growth opportunities. SMTN also directly implements projects offering staff the opportunity to work both as consultants and on implementation providing a unique perspective. Young staff work closely with senior consultants offering tremendous opportunities to take on significantly more responsibility for those who take initiative and demonstrate strong performance.  SMTN is by no means perfectfew fast growing small organizations can avoid growing painsbut I learned and grew a ton and gained experience that few of my peers have achieved.,0.0004552351,0.0015019561,0.9980428
As SMTN is a relatively small consulting office project loads are not always constant leading to periods where staff can be overstretched by overlapping projects (although vacation benefits help to compensate).   For a number of years the inhouse staff was skewed towards young professionals; more senior staff sometimes struggled to provide sufficient support when teams were stretched (although the organization was improving this balance at the time I left). While senior shortterm consultants were often engaged when additional support was needed they often were not as effective as mentors for more junior staff.   The open office environment was better suited to more extroverted personalities and those who took initiative. However by the time I left the organization had implemented more formal professional development processes to ensure that staffing decisions were made based on our individual interests.   When SMTN provides technical assistance to partner organizations as is true in consulting across industries partners may not always adopt all recommendations. While this occurs in all industries this can be demotivating for staff who join SMTN without an appreciation for the challenges involved in implementing recommendations. Colleagues who did well were those who took initiative recognized that development work is not easy and can involve difficult tradeoffs understood the art of promoting behavior change and enjoyed supporting partners to solve problems and develop appropriate solutions.,0.99636084,0.0034600792,0.00017909487

I can speak from my own experience of sacrificing my life to this organization only to be tossed aside like garbage once they had used me. This is exactly what they do on a whole with employees not only in Canada but also in other countries. They take advantage of your good intentions youthful energy and desire to make this world a better place. They are very sneaky about it and use techniques that feel like brainwashing. They make you feel guilty they make you feel indebted to them for them giving you the opportunities that they give you and they make you feel like dirt if you do not sacrifice yourself willingly.   I was sent to another country to work. I was not provided with the proper legal visas and thus was cut off from my working rights. I was made to work so many extra hours that I hardly had my own life anymore. I was expected to do all of this working nights and weekends working 24/7 for over a month at a time without any extra pay any lieu time nothing. I am one example of this type of treatment and I am not an anomaly. I am one of hundreds of people who work for this organization who are treated in the same way. I am one of countless individuals working in developing countries who are expected to work without proper visas and without receiving proper pay and benefits.   It is true that if you are driven and passionate you will succeed I succeeded with this organization because I worked so extraordinarily hard. However I stopped believing in working for an organization with such unbalanced expectations of staff. I believe that if you are going to sacrifice your life and dedicate yourself to something it should be something that is done right something that you can put your name behind because you know that things are being done correctly. I know for a fact that this organization is not doing things correctly and that they try to hide behind photos of happy children. People need to know that although they are doing a lot of good things in a lot of countries they are also able to do these good things because they do not operate correctly. They take advantage of their staff many of which come from the same communities that they claim to be helping. They do not pay them properly and tell their managers to discourage them from looking into their labour rights. They quite simply use people.   For me this is a CON. Even though it is an organization where you can learn a lot and have opportunities to be creative and to travel and to be a part of something interesting the very base of it is wrong. Those in charge know that they are doing things incorrectly. They willingly place people in situations that they should not be placed in and expect them to sacrifice their own sense of morality in order to protect the larger 'vision'. They know they are not doing things correctly but they hide this truth and fight to hide it with tooth and nail.   You will be bullied and intimidated or made to feel guilty. You will be told many things that are not the truth. You will be not only asked but required to do things that you know should not be done. You will be required to work extra hours without extra pay or time off. You will be required to help build a very specific and protected image that does not reflect reality. You will be treated with disrespect from upper management and if you question what is happening you will flat out be treated like garbage. You will be thrown out on the street if you live in their staff housing. You will be treated as if you do not matter at all.,0.9950517,0.0045000254,0.00044829724

"For an organization with a mandate to inspire youth and free children from situations of poverty and exploitation the directors and upper management of this organization have lost their moral compass along their way. As many others have explained in their own reviews of their experiences with Free the Children and Me to We employees are treated in an absolutely despicable and disheartening manner and upper management and the directors are absolutely unapologetic about it.  Employees of Free the Children (FTC) are typically young and idealistic individuals with hopes of gaining experience in the development sector and are typically working their first big jobs after graduating university. FTC seems like an ideal start to your future career being touted as the #1 employee for youth and the largest network of youth helping youth and an environment where you are encouraged to grow and learn and be creative. Unfortunately for these eager and bighearted new employees the workplace environment has been carefully constructed in order to shame and guilt employees into working extraordinary hours above and beyond their paid word week without even a glimmer of a hope of being compensated. If someone questions these practices they are given stern warnings and lectures by upper management to ""live the core values"" and to fall in line. The expectations to give and give and essentially sacrifice your time energy and life to this organization is astounding. It is an absolute expectation from upper management most likely because they themselves are the people who started the organization from scratch and sacrificed themselves to help it grow. The problem is that the organization is no longer a small group of friends operating out of a basement. It is a large organization that needs to be led by serious and mature individuals not people with puffedup titles and no grip on how a serious organization should be run.   Although you are given some incredible opportunities to be creative and learn new things it comes at a very high cost of needing to work incredible extra hours without being given extra pay or time off. You are replaceable and easily discarded which is reflected in the extremely high turnover rate of the 300 employees working around the world.   Not only are these practices morally deplorable but in many of the countries where this organization is working these practices are illegal. However that doesn't stop them from continuing to conduct their business in such a manner. Employees are required to fudge the truth in order to work in other countries and as a manager one is required to stay quiet and not discuss local employment standards and rights with local employees who are also required to work overtime without extra pay. Employees from Canada are used as facilitators to travel overseas and lead youth trips working 24 hours a day for upwards of 20 days straight under incredibly stressful conditions only to be given 2 days off despite working weekends holidays nights etc...    If you are an individual who is comfortable with being exploited and are in need of being brainwashed by core values and living to the standards that your upper management deems necessary or an individual comfortable with telling lies or hiding the truth from others this is an environment that you will be comfortable working in and in fact would excel in.   However if you have a strong moral compass and are looking for a workplace that allows you to maintain your moral integrity you should look somewhere else. Even if you have wonderful ideas on how to help them improve and the motivation to make a difference upper management will not respect this and will instead take it as an affront to their tried and true methodology.   This is an organization that is perfect for a pushover who is willing to devote their LIFE every moment of it to the job. It is perfect for someone with low self image because you can be easily moulded. It is perfect for those who do not want to speak up. It is perfect for people who do not mind being taken advantage of. It is perfect for people who are happy to look the other way when they know something is wrong.  If you are not that kind of person do not work here because if you do it will be a constant challenge and not the pleasant challenge of learning new things and becoming a better individual. It will mean that your upper management will constantly challenge you and test you to see if you will give up and conform to the expected exploitation.",0.9967084,0.0028188135,0.00047279932
