The interview process is very structured to a point where they don't get to the core of who you are as a person. I think they should be more flexible and adjust questions accordingly.,0.99652404,0.0033116832,0.0001642915

Informal interview that then led to a behavioural interview and then a final coffee catchup.  It was all as you would expect it to be and the hiring manager put you at ease. I'm guessing this varies from faculty to faculty/other departments.,0.000488331,0.99834037,0.0011712519

Just have to submit an application no real interview required. Also hiring based on academic grades. Not much to say about it really.  Also probably depends on department. Most departments require post grads to do tutoring engineering/computer science do allow people that aren't post grads to tutor.  Good luck,0.0006374345,0.99838173,0.0009808155
