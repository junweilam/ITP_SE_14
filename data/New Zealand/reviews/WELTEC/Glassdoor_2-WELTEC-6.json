Bullying and general female nastiness, and a lot of drama went on. There were a lot of women. Pushiness from management as well, too bad was a response thrown around. The place was like a badly run school camp or a gathering with your interfering, judgemental inlaws. There were some good people of course, but overall in my areas at that time it was issue after issue. Team Leaders were not leaders, they perpetuated the rubbish that was going on and encouraged it.  \r\n\r\nBUT getting to the pro, over time, those people left and retired. People with more experience, skills and better attitudes arrived, including management, and slowly the place began developing into a more professional and effective environment. There were still issues, bullying, but it got better. More people left and retired. Better people replaced them once again.\r\n\r\nAnd now in terms of people, it's so much better. It's a totally different scene from what it used to be. It's now a far more modern workplace. Some areas seem happier than others but overall in the admin areas, they are a good area to work, with decent processes and supportive staff. \r\n\r\nOther pros\r\nMain campus is local, in the Hutt.\r\n\r\n Unless you're in management or someone who lives for work, you don't take your work home with you. You come to work and then go home for the day. Very rare to work weekends. \r\n\r\nGood management, with some that really seem to care about their staff. Generous leave. Good parking. Good WFH opportunities. Staff counselling with external provider, free flu jabs available. A good union, it's not very active in terms of staff wanting to get involved but good to reap the benefits when they come through. More opportunities now to be involved in secondments etc whereas in the past it was pretty deadend. Decent remuneration.", "cons": "For a polytechnic, the IT equipment and systems are a bit rubbish but the IT staff do their best. Lack of money, and it shows. Tech, staff resources, general look of the place is pretty tired in some areas.\r\n\r\nSome staff have a tendency to get intense and high and mighty about ridiculous things. Some issues go in circles for far longer than needed. \r\n\r\nNo one really knows what is going to happen re the future of pomytechnics, can only assume lots of cuts and restructures so maybe think twice before you work here. A lot of time spent on using cultural words and phrases rather than anything else. \r\n\r\n\r\nNice people but general morale can get pretty low. Not a lot of fun stuff for students.\r\n\r\nCafe, but limited and very expensive. Can get pretty dull to work there at times. Not much in the way of formally recognising individual staff efforts and some clear favouritism when it does happen."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Enjoyed the job, struggling business", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Marketing in Wellington, Wellington", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wide range of marketing functions and opportunities", "cons": "Poorly paid, and very beaurocratic."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Tertiary Educator", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Jul 2021", "job_title": "University Lecturer in Wellington, Wellington", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Semi autonomous of the courses taught", "cons": "Too many administrative work to be completed on top of teaching"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Definitely would not reccomend.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Operations Support Officer in Petone", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Most of the employees were lovely", "cons": "Incompetent management, Terrible pay, Staff overworked"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Appalling Management, toxic environment", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Nov 2014", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Petone", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are very little pros to working in this toxic environment.
