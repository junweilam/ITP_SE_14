As a student, I have had ample opportunities to use these facilities for my projects and experiments, which has been immensely helpful. Vibrant student life: The University of Auckland has a diverse student population, and there is always something happening on campus. From clubs and societies to sports and cultural events, there is never a dull moment at this university.", "cons": "Expensive tuition fees: The University of Auckland is one of the most expensive universities in New Zealand, and the high tuition fees can be a burden for many students. While the education is of high quality, it can be difficult to justify the cost for some. Limited campus space: The university is located in the heart of Auckland, which means that there is limited space for expansion. As a result, the campus can feel crowded at times, and finding a quiet study spot can be challenging. Lack of diversity in faculty: While the student body is diverse, the same cannot be said for the faculty members.

Support staff perceived to exist purely as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff \u2013 drones with no other possible meaningful input. \"Collegiality\" serves only as a buzzword rolled out by Deans at staff Xmas functions or the (very) rare occasional lunch. As another reviewer put it so very well, the continued academic/professional staff split is a colossal drain on resources, and quite possibly the biggest root cause of the organisation-wide dysfunction.\r\n\r\nNo accountability for academic staff incompetence or bullying. This is tolerated under the guise of \"academic freedom\" \u2013 basically the notion that any established system, process, or regulation can be circumvented or trodden over completely when academics complain about their teaching and research being negatively impacted \u2013 no matter how non-specific or nonsensical the nature of the complaint may be.\r\n\r\nPublic-facing veneer of being a innovative employer, when the reality on the inside is it's the most risk-averse, innovation-hostile environment imaginable. Technology products are now bought off the shelf en-masse as a result of rolling redundancies eliminating whatever little internal creative technology expertise there was. Remaining support staff don't posses the know-how to do anything else, and absent a stimulating technology environment and *actual* career development, the scenario is of long-term, systemic, and sustained decline."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Steady job at university", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Nov 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Auckland, Auckland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Steady job in an organisation with good intentions\r\nsome good benefits like free optical and hearing checks\r\nSupportive university environment and culture", "cons": "Limited development opportunities since we are always busy\r\nPay does not increase significantly over time\r\nBureaucracy is slow and rigid - it can take weeks just to get an access card"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Data Analyst", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "24 Jan 2015", "job_title": "Data Analyst in Auckland, Auckland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Friendly environment\r\n- Flexible working hours", "cons": "- Slow pace working environment.

This does not allow shaping independent and stable plans for academic standards and support your professional pathway. \r\n\r\n(2)\tPoor management: highly bureaucratic, ambiguous and dependent on managers' discretion (although rules are well-written in papers). Students' complaints are not listened.\r\n\r\n(3)\tPoor communication: Communication between the university (faculty) and school managers is poor. You see the 'world class university ' at the top, and poor daily-management beside you. Communication is ambiguous, indirect, non-conclusive, non-effective. \r\n\r\n(4)\tAcademic standards: At school levels, academic standards are \u2018self-defined\u2019. It means that you need to align yourself with them to receive support. So, if you want to publish, apply to research funds, harmonise teaching and research, etc. you are in your own. \r\n\r\n(5)\tBackground: Do you have international experience? Do you have a valuable professional background? It does not count. You will need to start over. Also and based on your background (including country of origins) you may be quickly 'labelled' or 'profiled'.\r\n\r\n(6)\tNo intellectual motivation: There is a cultural setting of being anti-intellectual and thus, all relevant issues of our societies tend to be dismissed. \r\n\r\n(7)\tExpensive: If there is something expensive, it is New Zealand and Auckland (one of the top ten in the world, and this is not London, or NYC, or Tokyo) and salaries are not proportionate to this. Consider this to evaluate your work-life balance (holidays, trips, leisure, etc.). Renting a house is crazy expensive and rents are paid 'every week' (so, every week your account is getting down) and salaries are paid 'every 15 days', which makes everything rarer. Taking a flight to your home country? Think twice (double price)\u2026you will feel the isolation in many ways. Buying a house in Auckland?

As an international PhD student you are unsupported, mistreated and viewed only as a source of income for the university. \r\n2. The university suddenly changed its PhD scholarship policy without warning to exclude international students, especially in the Arts. This happened half-way through the academic year in 2015/6 and applied even to students who were already enrolled under the old rules. Unless you have a scholarship from your home country or another source of funding, it would be impossible to survive in Auckland.\r\n3. Graduate Teaching Assistant opportunities have become fewer, and when PhD students do teach this makes it difficult to complete their PhD work. Again, unless you come from a very wealthy background or have a scholarship, it is difficult to complete your PhD work while working as a GTA. In addition, it is difficult to survive in Auckland without a very good income (at least $3500 per month) as it is a very expensive city to live in. \r\n4. International students are discriminated against in the university policy in that they are not allowed to do any work on their dissertations outside of New Zealand. No exceptions are made for any extenuating personal circumstances, such as being severely injured in a car accident, being seriously ill or having a terminally ill parent. The university does not care. The only choices left to an international student are to either pay \"international\" fees, which are 10 times more than the domestic fees, or to suspend their doctorate (or quit outright). \r\n5. There is no one to advocate for international PhD students at the University of Auckland. There are some support personnel who support everyone in the university (not specifically for international PhD students)  but they are rarely aware of the particular challenges international PhD students face and often cannot even help with those issues. \r\n6. University housing is exorbitantly expensive and very low quality. The rooms I rented through the university housing cost approximately $1500 dollars per month, were cockroach infested, extremely cold, dark and unsafe. \r\n7. There is an unwritten policy at the University of Auckland not to hire its own PhD graduates, particularly international students of color, after their PhD completion. This means if you wish to find a job using your PhD after graduation, you cannot do so in Auckland. \r\n8.
