Some managers can be inexperienced in the role and opt to be micromanaging for the sake of having a good sense of order and control rather than trying to be a leader who inspires the team with integrity and bring out the best in people. This can be rather unfortunate as it decreases people's positive outlook on the workplace and the bad thing is that we do not have the opportunity to provide honest feedback on the subject. No surprise there are many hidden cases of bullying and harassment going around and not being brought to the light until some of us had resigned and reported the stories to the media for the world to take amusement.,0.99371344,0.0059144394,0.0003721068

We have well defined and communicated complaint processes and a handson People Team who welcome all and any dialogue around concerns or things that our people think we can improve on.

Sadly 90% of Greenpeace donations cover the payroll of Greenpeace telemarketers globally to grow the telemarketing team to grow the 10% of remaining donations. I thought I was contributing to a net positive activist organization but instead I was actually being paid to spend hours on the phone to greenwash people instead.

Organisation operates on the belief of helping the environment when really are just pushing hard sales with counterintuitive strategies and rules. Selling the idea of saving the planet more than actually doing anything productive/proactive/practical to enact real change. Hours are terrible. So many British transplants bringing UK office culture into the work environment difficult to be passionate about making our country a greener place when Englishmen are butchering Maori names of places and providing oversimplified and often misguided explanations/understandings of local politics and culture. It's hard to work at Greenpeace and feel that you're doing right when you actually care a lot about these issues and the organisation is willing to take advantage of your concerns to further take advantage of people.,0.9985362,0.001276139,0.00018761982

"Toxic management structure with little to no empathy for staff.   Culture of bullying is encouraged and goes against the stated values of the organisation. We are there for the students but management insists on putting up roadblocks for students e.g. shutting down student walkin access to registry. Leaked emails show an ageist culture has crept in recently with management determined to micromanage staff. Staff face unrealistic expectations from a management culture that is increasingly isolated. Culture of bullying from the top down. For example insisting on staff attending ""teambuilding"" exercises at their expense and then the manager not attending. Just one example of the mindgames played. HR department are detached and viewed with suspicion. Especially when they say things such as ""Oh no this isn't a review! It's an opportunity!""

"1) No housing available for overseas relocation.  2) Interdepartmental skirmishes almost daily. Supervisors LOVE to complain but do literally nothing to solve the problems.  3) Very minimal amount of grants in NZ basically just the annual Marsden rounds.  4) Administration lives in their own little bubble called Palmerston North.  5) No KPI or Milestone development. Career progress basically follows the whim of supervisors and admin. 6) Assignment of courses doesn't follow faculty strengths. 7) Misplacement of grant funding. They can't answer the question ""how much of my grant is left?"" 8) Yearly haemorrhaging of money largely due to mafioso 'preferred supplier' approach. For example overseas flight quotes from their ticketing agent Orbitz costs $50. For a quote one can get online or for free from FlightCentre.  9) They also running ""training"" programs which is basic stuff any professor knows. They advertise this by sending out colourprint brochures to faculty every term. Wonder how much those flyers bleed out of the budget? 9) Sold off half their Albany campus to pay the rising bills.  I could go on and on. Maybe the business/vet schools are good but if you're looking at STEM I suggest looking elsewhere. Like University of Auckland or Otago University. Or Europe. Or even Australia.

There were so many useless administrative processes which changed every few moths were badly designed inefficient and poorly explained. And no one was interested in ideas for improving the efficiency. Most of the people working there are literally  technically incompetent.  Even my HoS could barely use a computer.    There were no employees there under the age of 40 and the location in Lower Hutt made it very difficult for anyone commuting from Wellington.   I didn't do a PhD so I could spend half my time messing around with spreadsheets trying to make sense of other people's poorly designed planning documents.  There are so many better newly designed tools that can manage all aspects of the planning and administrative processes but the OP is still using Excel 97 spreadsheets to track hours spent working on revisions that you have to email every week to a admin person who probably then engages in a bunch of other obsolete processes. It was so ridiculous and a waste of resources all around.  The board made so many decisions that impacted our teaching without bothering to even consult any of the actual teaching staff so many times I felt like they were actually trying to make it harder for me to do my job.

They have lost sight of what we do or they never knew in the first place. They make nonsensical cuts and bad decisions.

The people  really enjoy working with my team!  I have a great manager who is supportive and knowledgable.  Working with other teams has been a positive experience as well people really seem to care about the end goal of supporting students.  Nice to be within an organisation that has so many people that specialise and are passionate about their discipline (trades creative arts etc)  Exciting time to be at Unitec  Unitec has gone/is going through a transformation  this can be exciting to work within and be able to enact change.   There's a lot of neat departments working on incorporating best practices in pedagogy and some cutting edge stuff going on.   Mt Albert is a beautiful campus  green spaces to enjoy lunch organic gardens a doggie training centre osteopathy clinic good gym  centrally located and free parking.    Really great work/life integration  I've stayed late on occasion however coming from corporate Unitec is night and day!,0.00019674412,0.0002380847,0.9995652
Transformation can be a double edge sword  sometimes change isn't easy and it can uncertain sometimes things take a long time to come to fruition however feel this change is for the long term gain of supporting students better.    Might be frustrating for people who prefer more agile workplace where decisions are made fast.,0.9811344,0.018570622,0.00029501686
The biggest pro by far is the company values; they actually mean something and are core to how the company operates obviously there is some variation by team and no company is perfect but overall I've never seen a company that means what it says when it comes to values especially in regards to commitment to their commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi.  A number of employee benefits including good working flexibility I've worked from home on occasion when necessary and hotdesked in a number of spaces.   Working in education obviously has an appeal as you're doing something meaningful.  Lots of fun things happening if you're in that.,0.0009922349,0.011230031,0.98777777
The amalgamation of all NZ ITPs means that there will be some role efficiencies that will need to be made so there will be uncertainty in the near future however it will mean a national reach which will benefit some roles. There are cultural issues between academic and nonacademic but I feel this is being addressed slowly by leadership. Government and of the economy greaty impact business but such is the nature of tertiary education.,0.79625595,0.2031691,0.00057494733

This place seemed to suffer from two major issues (or at least these were the two that frustrated me the most); first  there was constantly a massive gap between what the executive said and what they did  especially when it came to treatment of people. For example always talking about values and such but not living them at all. Or making decisions that were businesscentric after they spent time and money declaring the place would be studentcentric.  The second issue is that the ideas creation of fantastic and innovative future states was right up there  really brilliant stuff  but absolutely hopeless at following through with implementation.  Frequently the executive would get distracted with the next shiny new thing before they even got the last shiny thing happening properly.,0.9940923,0.0055914433,0.0003162993
Unitec has been through huge transformational change over the last year or so. This has been really good positive and much needed change.  The new leadership team are focused on success and collaborate well with staff to keep everyone engaged. I think we are now on track to move forward as a leader in vocational education. Unitec has  done a complete 180,0.00047944792,0.0026985,0.996822
With any change some people react better than others. Some staff who are stuck in their old ways are now having to lift their game and are being held accountable which they don't like.  Not a bad thing at all.   I also think that perhaps people still think of Unitec as being the organisation it was in the past. Unitec needs to tell their story of change and get others to understand that its not the place it used to be.,0.018381193,0.9812128,0.00040603752

Highquality education: The engineering program at the University of Auckland is known for its academic rigor and high standards. The faculty members are knowledgeable experienced and passionate about their subjects which makes for an excellent learning experience. Access to topnotch facilities: The university has invested heavily in its engineering facilities including stateoftheart labs research centers and equipment. As a student I have had ample opportunities to use these facilities for my projects and experiments which has been immensely helpful. Vibrant student life: The University of Auckland has a diverse student population and there is always something happening on campus. From clubs and societies to sports and cultural events there is never a dull moment at this university.,0.00026646888,0.0002969173,0.99943656
Expensive tuition fees: The University of Auckland is one of the most expensive universities in New Zealand and the high tuition fees can be a burden for many students. While the education is of high quality it can be difficult to justify the cost for some. Limited campus space: The university is located in the heart of Auckland which means that there is limited space for expansion. As a result the campus can feel crowded at times and finding a quiet study spot can be challenging. Lack of diversity in faculty: While the student body is diverse the same cannot be said for the faculty members. There is a lack of diversity among the teaching staff which can make it difficult for some students to connect with their professors.,0.9990734,0.0007609945,0.00016560516

University of Auckland true to the Kiwi work culture lays emphasis on worklife balance. There is an opportunity to interact with some great minds in diversified fields and offer IT based solution. Academic IT is very different from commercial world as it focuses on people rather than metrics. There is a genuine warmth with people who have been associated with the University for a long period of time.,0.00096357055,0.0034531674,0.99558324
Many of the IT solutions are outdated with time and there is a clear lack of leadership and architectural willpower to overhaul certain major components of the system and keep them insync with time. This is a major letdown if you are a newbie hire and want to work on latest technologies. Agile development takes a secondary seat to waterfall based method and not much of clear direction in terms of service delivery and project management.   There are some pockets which are showing progressive signs but the University can reap great benefits if it can overhaul its outdated systems to support responsive design and APIs for mobile based applications as well as desktop applications.  I think talent has to be recognized and promoted and likeminded folks should be interconnected with some form of activities. This encourages IT workers to test and implement new solutions and also think of replacing outmoded solutions and needless paperwork.,0.9968202,0.002903731,0.00027598967

There is not too much oversight as to what you do in the tutorials.  You might attend a very brief (and only moderately helpful) training and advice session and you might meet with the course coordinator once before being put into the classroom.  Some people might not be comfortable doing that especially if it is a class they took long ago or not at all.  While I personally put a lot of effort into preparing for my classes not all GTAs will which isn't a great experience for the students in their classes.,0.98618317,0.013535373,0.00028144932
I needed the teaching experience as a PhD student which I got through working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.,0.0005393199,0.99894303,0.00051766314
1. Insecure work environment; contracts only last a semester and the university does not let you know for sure how many tutorials you will be doing until right before the start of classes. It is impossible to plan ahead. 2. Extremely inadequate training; in fact I would even say I received almost no training at the start and yet I was criticized for any issues arising from lack of experience. 3. Pay did not correspond to the amount of work. We were paid as part time workers however the enormous volume of assignments and exams we had to mark meant working full time hours sometimes even weekends without adequate compensation. This also meant almost no time for PhD work.  4. No future. There were zero opportunities for advancement or for obtaining a full time academic job after completing a doctorate. There were no post doctoral positions or any other junior academic positions. Generally the University discourages PhD students from even thinking they can have a career there after graduation.,0.99917847,0.0006613074,0.0001602513

Pay raises are not as large as in other careers. Ultimately bureaucratic environment. Upper management focuses too heavily on making money through research and not enough on quality education. Upper level academics are not treated very well by upper management and there is an undercurrent of this in the working environment.

Administration incredibly bureaucratic hard to get anything done. Recent administration overhaul means that academics end up doing the admin. Focused on driving academics to get research funding requires large overhead to be added can't get anything done.

Auckland is too expensive and expanded for worklife balance. Academic work load is detrimental to worklife balance. Daycare facilities are indeed great if one can find a place for children. Some major decisions by upper management are made without consulting department level while others are made despite consultation. Recent administrative review uprooted the academicadministrative dynamics in the departments making live as an academic a lot more difficult and live as an administrator more expensive. The amount of annual reports that need to be written/read is mindboggeling.

 Teaching a small class (<50 students) will not pay more than my rent. It's not enough to live on as a graduate student. I have to supplement the income with another job.  The hourly rate looks good but they never give you a realistic number of hours in the contract for all the work you do in a semester. There's always a shortfall.   More experienced tutors are paid at a higher rate but for fewer hours so they usually end up with less money AND have to manage the other person teaching the course for the first time.  Poor organisation of contracts and positions. Often I don't know if I'll be tutoring this semester until a week or two before.

"Zero professional staff career progression or development. I mean zero. You can spend years there and not have your opportunities or salary (already well below the market average because ""something something public sector"") budge at all.  No shortage of arrogant ungrateful academics who look down their collective noses at professional support staff. I can't overstate just how deeply ingrained in academic culture this is with an even distribution across junior to senior academics. Perk of academic life perhaps?  Zero academic <> professional staff collegiality. Support staff perceived to exist purely as the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff – drones with no other possible meaningful input. ""Collegiality"" serves only as a buzzword rolled out by Deans at staff Xmas functions or the (very) rare occasional lunch. As another reviewer put it so very well the continued academic/professional staff split is a colossal drain on resources and quite possibly the biggest root cause of the organisationwide dysfunction.  No accountability for academic staff incompetence or bullying. This is tolerated under the guise of ""academic freedom"" – basically the notion that any established system process or regulation can be circumvented or trodden over completely when academics complain about their teaching and research being negatively impacted – no matter how nonspecific or nonsensical the nature of the complaint may be.  Publicfacing veneer of being a innovative employer when the reality on the inside is it's the most riskaverse innovationhostile environment imaginable.

(4) Students are very motivated above all international and Chinese students.,0.0003879419,0.00097358663,0.99863845
(1)	Discretionary environment: The environment is highly arbitrary/discretionary (no meritocracy at all) in everything (teaching research academic service participation in conferences funding etc.). This does not allow shaping independent and stable plans for academic standards and support your professional pathway.   (2)	Poor management: highly bureaucratic ambiguous and dependent on managers' discretion (although rules are wellwritten in papers). Students' complaints are not listened.  (3)	Poor communication: Communication between the university (faculty) and school managers is poor. You see the 'world class university ' at the top and poor dailymanagement beside you. Communication is ambiguous indirect nonconclusive noneffective.   (4)	Academic standards: At school levels academic standards are ‘selfdefined’. It means that you need to align yourself with them to receive support. So if you want to publish apply to research funds harmonise teaching and research etc. you are in your own.   (5)	Background: Do you have international experience? Do you have a valuable professional background? It does not count. You will need to start over. Also and based on your background (including country of origins) you may be quickly 'labelled' or 'profiled'.  (6)	No intellectual motivation: There is a cultural setting of being antiintellectual and thus all relevant issues of our societies tend to be dismissed.   (7)	Expensive: If there is something expensive it is New Zealand and Auckland (one of the top ten in the world and this is not London or NYC or Tokyo) and salaries are not proportionate to this. Consider this to evaluate your worklife balance (holidays trips leisure etc.). Renting a house is crazy expensive and rents are paid 'every week' (so every week your account is getting down) and salaries are paid 'every 15 days' which makes everything rarer. Taking a flight to your home country? Think twice (double price)…you will feel the isolation in many ways. Buying a house in Auckland? Just forget it (and housing quality and layout are really poor).,0.99869126,0.0011474149,0.0001613109
"The only advantage was that the university supposedly allows international PhD students to pay ""domestic"" fees' however as I mention in the cons section this comes with many strings attached as to make it a disadvantage.",0.009071668,0.99040365,0.0005246965
"1. As an international PhD student you are unsupported mistreated and viewed only as a source of income for the university.  2. The university suddenly changed its PhD scholarship policy without warning to exclude international students especially in the Arts. This happened halfway through the academic year in 2015/6 and applied even to students who were already enrolled under the old rules. Unless you have a scholarship from your home country or another source of funding it would be impossible to survive in Auckland. 3. Graduate Teaching Assistant opportunities have become fewer and when PhD students do teach this makes it difficult to complete their PhD work. Again unless you come from a very wealthy background or have a scholarship it is difficult to complete your PhD work while working as a GTA. In addition it is difficult to survive in Auckland without a very good income (at least $3500 per month) as it is a very expensive city to live in.  4. International students are discriminated against in the university policy in that they are not allowed to do any work on their dissertations outside of New Zealand. No exceptions are made for any extenuating personal circumstances such as being severely injured in a car accident being seriously ill or having a terminally ill parent. The university does not care. The only choices left to an international student are to either pay ""international"" fees which are 10 times more than the domestic fees or to suspend their doctorate (or quit outright).  5. There is no one to advocate for international PhD students at the University of Auckland. There are some support personnel who support everyone in the university (not specifically for international PhD students)  but they are rarely aware of the particular challenges international PhD students face and often cannot even help with those issues.  6. University housing is exorbitantly expensive and very low quality. The rooms I rented through the university housing cost approximately $1500 dollars per month were cockroach infested extremely cold dark and unsafe.  7. There is an unwritten policy at the University of Auckland not to hire its own PhD graduates particularly international students of color after their PhD completion. This means if you wish to find a job using your PhD after graduation you cannot do so in Auckland.  8. Generally the outlook for work with a PhD from the University of Auckland Faculty of Arts is very bleak particularly within New Zealand.",0.9990681,0.0007734624,0.00015855963

 Very little job security (I had 78 fixedterm contracts over 5 years)  Absolutely no transparency or power over your advancement  I never met or talked to the people who made decisions about my salary or my contact and had to rely on others to fight for me  Advancement for general staff is connected mostly to years of service or people management.  As a result people who are motivated get frustrated and leave and those who are not are promoted to their level of incompetency. Skilled workers are often led by managers who have no knowledge or experience in what they are doing.

Highly productive research departments have been destroyed recently and many top faculty are looking to move elsewhere.

"I had a very poor experience at this employer. My work area had been incompetently managed over a period of years and there was much bitterness and disgruntlement. As a female with high standards and many achievements I faced more and more hostility and covert sabotage from colleagues as the years went by. This culminated in outright bullying and when I tried to get this addressed HR decided to try and make me the problem and get rid of me. This didn't work (as I hadn't done anything wrong) which then created a HUGE expensive mess for the University. My experience of University of Waikato HR is that they are thugs who are quite corrupt. I saw a number of VCs come and go in my time all of whom pledged to lift levels of professionalism at the University so I don't understand why they wouldn't move on people who have been there really an extraordinarily long time. ""The fish rots from the head."" In the end I had to leave as the bullying from certain colleagues wasn't ever going to stop.

No clear strategic leadership. Decisions made by opinion and feelings rather than concrete data analysis and results. Toxic leadership culture that seeks to blame others and avoid accountability. Lots of talk about ‘people first’ yet constant blame culture and restructuring implies otherwise. People at the front lines trying to decipher what leadership wants as it is constantly unclear yet get blamed for ‘failing to deliver’.  Constant reduction in staff had led to increased workload on staff and consequently low morale.

For a polytechnic the IT equipment and systems are a bit rubbish but the IT staff do their best. Lack of money and it shows. Tech staff resources general look of the place is pretty tired in some areas.  Some staff have a tendency to get intense and high and mighty about ridiculous things. Some issues go in circles for far longer than needed.   No one really knows what is going to happen re the future of pomytechnics can only assume lots of cuts and restructures so maybe think twice before you work here. A lot of time spent on using cultural words and phrases rather than anything else.    Nice people but general morale can get pretty low. Not a lot of fun stuff for students.  Cafe but limited and very expensive. Can get pretty dull to work there at times. Not much in the way of formally recognising individual staff efforts and some clear favouritism when it does happen.,0.99876773,0.0010586706,0.0001735539

Inefficient frustrating policies/procedures that date back to the 80's.  Management do not trust their staff.  Seem to have no problem with for example in stock items in NZ taking up to 2.5 weeks to be ordered and arrive.  Management will not listen to experienced staff's concerns/advice.  In fact they will bully you and try and find a way to dismiss you if you speak out.  Academically I would not recommend this place to any students either.,0.9990871,0.00075280236,0.00016005168

Almost too many to list.  Lack of understanding of marketing at management level yet complete reliance on marketing to keep the organisation afloat.   Toxic workplace.  Management paid massive salaries and lower level staff barely a cent over the living wage.   Green washing and jumping into bed with organisations destroying the environment.   Lack of strategy and clear direction.,0.9991973,0.0006445386,0.00015812754
