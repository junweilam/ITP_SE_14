"HR is the biggest problem there.  They do nothing to protect the staff from problem employees  the psychopaths narcissists and sexual harassers.  The most that will happen is that a problem employee will be shifted from department to department leaving a trail of wreckage behind them.  Problem employees are sometimes even favored as HR is afraid of them.    The hiring process can take a year or more and by then the best applicants have moved on leaving the rest.  The ERP implementation was and continues to be a disaster causing staff burnout and worse.  There is no staff development and a caste system between grades that keeps high performers in low positions and low performers in high positions Staff is blamed for systemic problems  ""the ladder""",0.99880064,0.001046729,0.00015260377

Nobody will care if you have an idea to improve the place.  So many amateurs but the drunken monkeys of HR would have to be the worse.  Basic decisions and processes that take hours or days in commercial enterprises take 6 months 12 months or are kicked down the road indefinitely. Always always blame someone else.

If you land in a good place you can have a pretty easy life with the benefits of working for the public sector. BVA insurance private pension contributions Kindergarten and other perks. The environment can be pretty chill and colleagues are generally pretty nice.  Good conditions for people wanting to raise children have a parttime job that covers basic social security and pension while not investing much of your life working. In certain places/positions people are hired for 5 10 15 hours so if this is your aim this could be the ideal place for you.

"The biggest con of this university is that there is a lot of red tape it is very old fashioned and hierarchical. The ""rules"" are consistently bent and hacked and things are arranged behind the scenes so in practice the Med Uni Graz operates more like a private company than a public university and the directors of each institute have nearly complete power so good/permanent jobs are given more often than not politically and via connections not based on merit and qualifications.  If you are unlucky you can land in a very stressful institute/job with a really low salary for what you do: young doctors PhD students and temporary staff work hard and do most of the work and are offered an uncertain future in exchange. I know some PhD students who are forced to work on weekends in labs and are having a really stressful life hoping they will get a great job after they finish their PhD.  As a clear example of all this the 6 year rule (after 6 years of chaining temporary contracts the law says you need to get a permanent contract) sounds great on paper. However it is constantly ""hacked"" (e.g. they send you to the AMS for 6 months or similar arrangements) so that no one gets a permanent contract (either because they want to avoid it or because they can't afford it). The Union (Betriebsrat) knows this perfectly and does nothing about it.",0.9963721,0.003273451,0.00035447493

 Salzburg Global Seminar is a great place to work/intern at especially if you're looking to transfer/channel your knowledge and past experiences into working in a more organizational/nonprofit environment.  The staff across all departments are very friendly approachable and helpful.  Supervisors are helpful and guide you when you're unsure of a task.  The environment (the Schloss Leopoldskron itself) provides a lovely ambience to work and unwind in.  You get to meet a lot of people from different countries from all walks of life during SGS programs and sessions.  You're allowed to suggest/discuss new ideas or a certain project you'd like to work on with your supervisor.  Internship program manager is very friendly and cares a lot about intern wellbeing.  You're kind of left to be independent but supervisors are always around to assist you.  Interns are well taken care of even though the internship is unpaid. But interns get free board free food sometimes free tickets to attend some exclusive events outside or inside the Schloss and they can attend/work on all sessions/SGS programs.  Diversity in work place. Many staff and interns are all from different parts of the world  Africa Asia the Americas Europe Australia etc.,0.00026387104,0.00036212752,0.999374
 Sometimes when there are a lot of sessions during a period it might get very tasking for an intern and a little pressure begins to build up. During some sessions interns can work on Saturdays and Sundays (especially program interns) past 6PM. BUT the interns are FULLY AWARE of this anyway before coming to Salzburg as they're made aware that during some sessions they might have to work on weekends late into the evening.  Some interns can take up two intern roles with different tasks. But again if an intern is taking up two different roles/tasks they're made aware of it before hand and can oblige to do it or not.,0.74991864,0.24952492,0.00055644696
Working within an amazing staff that is welcoming and always willing to help. The people who attend the seminars are truly inspirational. You end up making conversation with them over lunches and dinners and getting life advice from these successful people from different fields and backgrounds. Oh and living in a palace with beautiful scenery is definitely a pro as well!,0.00027377543,0.0003393237,0.9993869

Internships are basically unpaid and the load of work varies depending on the season. Usually autumn has the most sessions and therefore it is the busiest time. Your supervisor also constantly change depending on what sessions you work on.,0.99859124,0.001273446,0.0001351751
Some of the pros of working at Seefar: • Opportunities to grow in your career • Opportunities to travel to different countries where your projects are • You can learn lots of new things in your job and also by doing courses • Salaries are good compared to NGOs and humanitarian organisations,0.00032968857,0.0009831636,0.9986872
These are the most important cons of working at Seefar: • Toxic productivity: You constantly expected to work productively at Seefar and if not your contract could be terminated at any point. They many times let people who were considered unproductive go to induce fear that other staff will be next. They make them an example. This creates a very negative feeling among the team. • No worklife balance: the workplace culture is that you have no other commitments in your personal life so that you can work 12 hour work days. You are given double the amount of work than other organisations. If you have any child care health care or personal commitments that get in the way of your work you need to make up missed work later. • Very unsympathetic management: What I noticed during my time at the job was sympathetic people are pushed away of the organisation because they clash with the dominant management style which is cold calculated. Many people who were more sympathetic were made to feel very bad until quitting or were let go without any reason for it • There is lots of gossip and no transparency: Management makes decisions that they do not explain properly to the staff and workers. This creates a situation where people are always gossiping and discussing what they think is happening. Many people are also scared for their future as you can get fired anytime so they can become resentful and contribute to the gossip. • Benefits are not real: unlimited leave benefits cannot be taken if there is too much work. Other benefits like professional development increased stress when we had to complete courses when we also had to complete work at the same time. The high salaries are compensated by lots of unpaid overtime that you will never get compensated,0.99895287,0.0008901417,0.0001569611

Often advice by older research staff(beyond post doc level)  is sparse and not really related/relevant to own research problems  or even distracting from the important aspects. Professors seem oblivious to the real research problems at hand and are most of the time occupied with their (important but never ending) hunt for funding or just traveling around another conference (without actually presenting publications there).  New Research staff does not get proper support  I'm glad that I started my PhD elsewhere so I was able to start a lot more efficiently than how I see things develop for younger PhD students here at the TU Graz.  It is sometimes embarrassing to assist in teaching while being fully aware that a lecture is outdated in many spots the corresponding practical exercise is lacking in didactics or overly focused with interchangeable / arbitrary technical details.  But to improve the situation one would have to sacrifice too much of one's time for research.    Abundance of bureaucratic regulations  not just for PhD Students. Information on regulations is scattered over many places. Administrative staff often seems unmotivated and provides contradicting advice on bureaucratic regulations.

The University is very active in applied research having a significant share on third party funded projects from industry public institutions and international bodies (e.g. EC funds). This means a good knowledge transfer from research to teaching. Project managers have the main responsibility also on the financial issues and can build up research groups depending on their budget framework. The working atmosphere is normally good under rather flexible conditions also concering worklife balance (e.g. for familiy).,0.00019274082,0.00052544044,0.9992818
The structure with a high share of nonstate funded (project funded) staff puts a burden for project acquisition on PMs and it is not easy to keep track on long term research topics (especially for larger groups).
