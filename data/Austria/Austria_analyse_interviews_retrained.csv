They make you jump over so many hurdles during the long interview process very time consuming. They never came back with an answer only months later when I wrote them (multiple times) did they say they chose someone else months before. Very disrespectful,0.99886847,0.0009853411,0.00014623416

No transparency at all. The recruitment processs cancels without notification. Presumably it is a bad custom of international organizations that preselect candidate(s) already exists always.

Competencybased interview but also substantive technical questions. Significant preparation required. I'd recommend reading up on how to interview with the IAEA specifically. Generally speaking you will need to meet all of the requirements and then some to receive an interview.,0.015398203,0.98426545,0.00033637177
I received an invitation for an interview within 7 days from applying for the role that was limited for 1 year. The interview was planned to be online through the software IAEA uses SONRU given the fact the job level was international and regardless of the fact that I was based in Vienna and hence could attend it personally. I recorded my interview following a thorough preparation. Just after I did it I noticed in IAEA recruitment portal that this position was cancelled/closed and exactly the same one yet with a contract for 3 years was advertised. So instantly I applied for the latter. Never heard back from HR department regarding feedback on my SONRU interview for a 1year role nor was considered for an exactly the same role yet with a 3years contract.,0.87237734,0.1272895,0.00033309867
