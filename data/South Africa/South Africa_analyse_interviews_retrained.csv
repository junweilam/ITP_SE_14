I applied online. I was contacted by HR for interview several months later. They also requested referees whom they contacted for references. The interview was then also held online with a panel of around 6 people. HR then took over six months to give feedback after the interview and ignored emails requesting updates.,0.9983193,0.0015605085,0.00012013307

Pleasant and brief I was alerted via email of the interview which took about 30minutes. The questions were pretty standard and easy to answer. The management within the department were clearly looking for wellbalanced candidates.,0.010774704,0.6544251,0.3348002
It was as proffesional as much as i expected it to be. The panel consisted of more than ten members which is a bit scary for a person who might be a first timer on an interview. The panel was impressed about my appearance and how honest i was with my previous experiences outside the university and inside. My confidents also played an important role as the panel continued with their questions.,0.0019861208,0.9964813,0.0015325347
