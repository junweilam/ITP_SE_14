"N/A", "pros": "NWU, like most previously white universities, has its quirks, yet many strides have been made to move in the right direction. \nThere are many opportunities at NWU for growth, especially for young scholars, and I would motivate young scholars to start and complete their Ph.D., while they can. NWU supports lifelong learning-so use this to your advantage. \nDo not leave without your Ph.D., regardless of the pay increase outside of academia. \nSupportive managers, I don't think this applies to all managers, but I had a good manager. The idea is to focus on their work management and not their personality. It was a privilege that my manager encourage growth and supported all my efforts to grow in and outside of NWU.\nFlexibility over holidays and also during the day, may you need to run home in case of emergency or child-school issues. \nGood people in departments, although the workload is very high at times most people in my department enjoyed their job 70% of the time. \nI met the best people at NWU, some in my department and some in different faculties and departments. My overall experience is Potch campus is a place to grow, learn and move on especially if you are an alumnus. \nGood students, mostly Afrikaans speaking, but the English classes grew steadily (Potch campus). Students can be sometimes a little disruptive, I think based on the dynamics in the world expect that students ask difficult questions everywhere and can (have a right to) challenge academic staff.", "cons": "Very heavy workload in my department. High student numbers with very little flexibility in budget for support needed to grade and moderate papers. \nLow-quality assurance or respect for this process, although this is compulsory. \nEqual approach to salary scales, yet very clear disparity in workload per department. For example; some departments have very few students, less grading, less quality assurance, and faculty admin-related task; however, the number of employees seems to be equal to departments with staggering numbers of students. This is a huge issue for departments with professional registration degrees where courses have to be aligned across campuses and with the outcomes of professional bodies. This adds much stress and pressure on academic staff to serve as teachers and in their professional capacity. \nSpeaking about alignment; THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES AT NWU. You as a teacher have absolutely no autonomy. You have to work together with two other teachers to reach (hopefully amicable) outcomes and design courses. However, this challenges the very nature of academia and has an immense impact on young scholars. Bullies get their way and force all other teachers to follow and not lead. This hammers pedagogy and steamy professional growth in teaching. The classes (taking into account all variables) are very different on each campus, but the teacher cannot use their unique approach to help their students, because they have to write the same test at the same time over the three campuses. \nAlthough not openly against any race, Black staff don't last very long. Scholars with great academic potential leave the Potch campus very prematurely. There is very little being done to retain people of color. And if you are a person of color planning to work at NWU, POTCH campus be aware that the idea is that you have to conform to the culture around you, they don't have to accommodate you in any way. \nMy 2nd biggest issue is the complete inbreeding in the academic space. Most NWU employees (Like myself) are an alumnus. Most academic staff started their undergraduate degree at NWU and followed through to the Ph.D. level. There is nothing wrong with this, HOWEVER, this means methodology and ontological movements stay the same. You will most likely work with your supervisor and never grow out of the thoughts and ways they taught you. \nIn the department, I am you have fossil professors with no other work or life experiences outside of NWU and Potchefstroom. This has a tremendous influence on research, productivity, and also the curriculum. People are stuck in their ways, and teach courses for over 30 years, which is extremely backward with the growth in HE. \nVERY low salaries compared to other universities. \nExtremely high demands for admin-related work, with very little compensation for overtime. \nHigh abuse system if you have poor boundaries. \nActive bullying."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook":
