Incredible colleagues rooted in movement experience strong theory of change really devoted to bottom up change and the long run transformative work (for the most part though some country offices could do better) great training and learning opportunities only big organisation I've come across that at least tried to look at it's own power relations internally. Not sure where that is now. Wish this organisation very well because it is golden. I learned a tremendous amount and am grateful,0.004695356,0.03938032,0.95592433
Endless restructures that wasted time and left organisation in near constant paralysis 34 of international secretariat in time I was there. Brazilian ceo had amazing vision and powerful representative you would be proud of but completely incoherent in how he wielded power ruthless in how he treated people. Not the feminist leader he asked us to be. Disappointed ultimately,0.99734926,0.0023680322,0.00028276138

 AA International CEO has created a highly political & insular culture of favouritism & nepotism which disempowers staff. ActionAid is a sinking ship and he is at the helm clearly scrambling to jump off . He has driven it into the ground and I would not be surprised if it folds within the next 5 years.  Awful HR & IT capacity  Corrosive internal politics  infighting between Directors & Country Directors with lower level staff often caught in between  Focus on internal politics diverts attention from the mission and organisational effectiveness in achieving its work and means that good staff are lost quickly    Very cliquey with no effective performance management nor accountability  Limited job security  numerous restructures due to various funding crises as leadership clearly don't know how to adjust to a changing funding landscape  Systems and approaches are from a different era  dysfunctional & dinosaurlike organisation,0.99903727,0.00081091304,0.00015179129

AA is a highly political organisation in a negative way. Rather than working together as a federation different country programmes vie for influence funding power and control and often times it is global north countries that dictate terms and conditions to global south countries.  The lack of clarity around projects and processes is also an ongoing issue and is so disappointing when that funding could go to local organisations on the ground who need it and are not 'professional activists' actually facing the issues outlined in such projects There is little/no internal democracy either between global north/south country programmes and less so in the hierarchical organisational structure. This also means that manager's decisions no matter how inefficient unethical sexist or shortsighted cannot be questioned or issues broached without the possibility that raising such will result in the whistleblower being let go or warned The wages paid to support staff/service providers in global south country programmes is near poverty levels and often do not include such things as health insurance or school fees aid  disappointing an organization dedicated to poverty alleviation would not start with those who work in manual labour positions for the organisation Career advancement is nonexistent in AA and it appears that if you are actually good at your job that will be seen to challenge others and they will work actively to block you Sexism and sexual harassment run rampant and complaints are not taken seriously if at all dealt with even when reported to International Auditors at AA Global north contracts for the same positions as the global south are much better in terms of time pay benefits etc. Local contracts do not include school fees help whilst international contracts do even where both colleagues are working in the same office meaning that educational inequality is actually policy in AA,0.99867046,0.001174991,0.0001544763

Way too little pay for what is expected of you as a researcher yet the NWU wastes money on trying to appear inclusive.,0.9989415,0.0008816384,0.00017685822
NWU like most previously white universities has its quirks yet many strides have been made to move in the right direction. There are many opportunities at NWU for growth especially for young scholars and I would motivate young scholars to start and complete their Ph.D. while they can. NWU supports lifelong learningso use this to your advantage. Do not leave without your Ph.D. regardless of the pay increase outside of academia. Supportive managers I don't think this applies to all managers but I had a good manager. The idea is to focus on their work management and not their personality. It was a privilege that my manager encourage growth and supported all my efforts to grow in and outside of NWU.Flexibility over holidays and also during the day may you need to run home in case of emergency or childschool issues. Good people in departments although the workload is very high at times most people in my department enjoyed their job 70% of the time. I met the best people at NWU some in my department and some in different faculties and departments. My overall experience is Potch campus is a place to grow learn and move on especially if you are an alumnus. Good students mostly Afrikaans speaking but the English classes grew steadily (Potch campus). Students can be sometimes a little disruptive I think based on the dynamics in the world expect that students ask difficult questions everywhere and can (have a right to) challenge academic staff.,0.0034595772,0.02172317,0.9748173
Very heavy workload in my department. High student numbers with very little flexibility in budget for support needed to grade and moderate papers. Lowquality assurance or respect for this process although this is compulsory. Equal approach to salary scales yet very clear disparity in workload per department. For example; some departments have very few students less grading less quality assurance and faculty adminrelated task; however the number of employees seems to be equal to departments with staggering numbers of students. This is a huge issue for departments with professional registration degrees where courses have to be aligned across campuses and with the outcomes of professional bodies. This adds much stress and pressure on academic staff to serve as teachers and in their professional capacity. Speaking about alignment; THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES AT NWU. You as a teacher have absolutely no autonomy. You have to work together with two other teachers to reach (hopefully amicable) outcomes and design courses. However this challenges the very nature of academia and has an immense impact on young scholars. Bullies get their way and force all other teachers to follow and not lead. This hammers pedagogy and steamy professional growth in teaching. The classes (taking into account all variables) are very different on each campus but the teacher cannot use their unique approach to help their students because they have to write the same test at the same time over the three campuses. Although not openly against any race Black staff don't last very long. Scholars with great academic potential leave the Potch campus very prematurely. There is very little being done to retain people of color. And if you are a person of color planning to work at NWU POTCH campus be aware that the idea is that you have to conform to the culture around you they don't have to accommodate you in any way. My 2nd biggest issue is the complete inbreeding in the academic space. Most NWU employees (Like myself) are an alumnus. Most academic staff started their undergraduate degree at NWU and followed through to the Ph.D. level. There is nothing wrong with this HOWEVER this means methodology and ontological movements stay the same. You will most likely work with your supervisor and never grow out of the thoughts and ways they taught you. In the department I am you have fossil professors with no other work or life experiences outside of NWU and Potchefstroom. This has a tremendous influence on research productivity and also the curriculum. People are stuck in their ways and teach courses for over 30 years which is extremely backward with the growth in HE. VERY low salaries compared to other universities. Extremely high demands for adminrelated work with very little compensation for overtime. High abuse system if you have poor boundaries.

If you’re a high performing selfmotivated professional who wants to be given the space to excel then Orbis is a good fit for you. However if you’re in search of an uncomplicated 9 to 5 job then look elsewhere. The organisation attracts leaders who are strategic resultsorientated tough yet fair and they expect their teams to deliver. I had the privilege of working for Orbis International Africa for almost five years and chose to leave only because I was offered an incredible opportunity to work for a leading private foundation (from fundraising to funder – who could ask for more?). It needs to be said that had I not been offered the position I would happily have stayed with Orbis for another 5 years.

Working in the first pilot research project in SA that offers heroin addicts to recieve Methadone to reduce their using as well as a Drop in Centre that offers groups counselling and practical support  I love working with complex vulnerable clients and homelessness.  I feel hope when we are able to change a clients life in little ways including trying to get them shelter ID support with court cases and the fact that they are able to receive free counselling which is so much needed for these disadvantaged clients.,0.16485098,0.11896882,0.7161802
As I am the only counsellor I may see a large amount of clients a day asking for help with different issues as well as counselling which can be extremely emotionally difficult as there is so much trauma in the past and in the present.  There is also hardly any support for clients in need of a holistic approach however that is not possible and that is difficult because they so desperately need Maslow's hierarchy of needs and they do not even have the basics which is food shelter etc.  Coming from the UK it has really opened my eyes about how much poverty there is here and the government has not done anything to fund new resources and are actually fining people for rough sleeping.  They wonder why there is so much crime in the country because people need to survive and have to resort to crime in order to survive. I find it very challenging as you know these clients have the capabilities to further their lives however can't because there is no further support than our drop in centre which only reaches a tiny portion of the population.,0.9988373,0.0010224668,0.00014029648
