All of the negative reviews apply. Many of the management is very twofaced and pretend to give support. But instead they throw teachers under the bus and allow rumors to spread. I would rather have no support than fake support. Behavior problems could be easily solved but the administration does not want to offend their customers. Teachers have no freedom on what they teach or how. Personally that would not be a problem if it wasn't for how disorganized the school is. Image is everything. Also they will hold people's passports and/or work permits so they can't leave. But that interferes with holidays. And your pay might be late nowadays. That is a recent problem. Many administration during meetings use the meetings to insult teachers.,0.99859077,0.001253614,0.00015560274

1. Salary is high because of the living cost. 2. Location is set in the center of Bangkok where you can connect to all of the transports. Plus the school is so close to China Town. 3. Most Thai staffs are genuinely friendly. 4. The lab in EP is remodeled.,0.3314325,0.28541923,0.38314825
1. Exterior looks is everything.  2. Micromanagement within EP program makes foreign teachers feel uncomfortable. It drives teachers away and result in less communication within groups.  Since 2020 the management team had put so many restrictions on foreign teachers that make teachers feel like prisoners at their own workplace. Additionally teachers are likely to be blamed when the complains arise and are monitored closely to watch teacher's behavior. This result with no improvement in teaching methodology. This is the kind of employer that focus on teacher's flaws and issues rather than working with teachers to better the teaching outcomes. The kind of employer that order the tasks and mandate regulations for teachers to follow and ensure they keep their mouths shut and do as told. Hence you will always be wrong as a teacher at Assumption College Bangrak. 3. Students are your customers not pupils. Your job is to make them happy at all cost. If they are not happy with their grades it's your fault. The parents will be hunting you down. Your name will get reported to the highest person in charge.  4. White male subculturedriven in disgusting in English Program.  5. Copy machines are in poor conditions for such a prestigious school. Teachers always have to root if there will be ink on the paper when they print out or the pages lineup correctly. 6. The only one teacher's bathroom always smell like sewerage backflow. Toilet tends to get flooded weekly.  7. Most students feel that they are entitled to good grades because their parents paid money. 8. The chairs and tables in the classrooms are outdated and are perfect pieces of heavy woods and metals that waiting to cut deep into skin when students play or even move in the class rooms. Those metal chairs are too heavy and have sharp edges. 9. Cellular phones addiction is scary. 10. Fail to read information/books and able to understand what they read is a large price to pay. (Most students cannot comprehend information they read from the books).,0.9985461,0.0012540637,0.00019980645

Facilities: The newer administration & music buildings along with the sports fields were very impressive. It was clear that Assumption College pays close attention to such details and ensures that public functions showcase these facilities to parents and other visitors.,0.0005715761,0.0020181134,0.99741036
Interview process: The initial conversation was rather vague and informal questioning continued (with additional staff members) after the interview proper.   It seemed that the team was not familiar with how to interview candidates appropriately.  Administration & management: Organisation was severely lacking. Teachers' class and duty schedules changed almost daily. Teachers and other staff were added and removed from classes and duty periods constantly. Communication is poor and often contradictory with various middle managers offering conflicting instructions.  Communications: Instead of following modern standards (email) or even older norms (paper memo) the school relies on a messaging app (Line) to share information ask staff to take on additional duties or to call for meetings. This results in staff routinely checking their phones sometimes even during classes which is disruptive to the learning environment.  Facilities: Staff room and classrooms were old and in disrepair. The air conditioning units went out almost daily. Computers and AV equipment were quite dated and sometimes experienced technical difficulties. Oftentimes multiple buildings' restroom facilities were out of order causing staff to cross campus to simply wash hands or use the toilet. Even when working most restrooms routinely lacked basic toilet paper and soap.  Workload: The total number of subjects and levels far exceeded the normal amount assigned to teachers in Western countries. The total number of teaching hours was reasonable but having to prepare teach and mark papers for such a large number of subjects and levels was unusual.  Student learning: Many students were academically unprepared for the grade levels and courses that they were in which hinted at a lack of adequate academic preparation and rigor in earlier years.  Student behaviour: At both the primary & secondary levels a majority of students were routinely offtask out of their seats shouting and disruptive. School policy permits nothing more than a verbal request to return to study which students routinely ignore. A lack of administrative support in this area causes a poor learning environment and diminished learning on the part of all students.  Student safety: Students administer their own medications throughout the day without the supervision of the school nurse or other medical professional. Play fighting wrestling and physical altercations were considered normal at the school. Both primary and secondary students had paper cutting blades and would often play with them both during and after classes. In spite of repeated reports to administration on these issues it appears that management is not concerned about student safety.  Other: The HR & Finance departments take a monthly 'deposit' of 2000 THB during the first year of employment. They say that this is their policy to ensure that teachers stay at Assumption and do not leave without notice. This practice seems legally dubious and indicates that Assumption College suffers from a teacher retention problem.,0.99894184,0.0009055836,0.00015257267

By the standards of Southeast Asian schools which are still catching up to western education and facilities Assumption College Thonburi is magnificent. The campus is as well maintained as you can expect any campus that large with thousands of students and hundreds of faculty to be. Of course there are occasional conflicts in differences of thinking but I can say after working at other Thai schools that Assumption College Thonburi is at least making an effort to be progressive and that they trust the foreign teachers to incorporate their own methods. Ultimately I feel like most teachers foreign and Thai are invested in the students' education.,0.0022455058,0.9667499,0.031004481
With a growing number of foreign staff the school does need to empathize with foreign staff. Benefits do disappear (and to ACT's credit unexpectedly appear) without discussion. I understand why management at the top might think that if it's ok for the Thais  it's ok for the foreigners but it's actually a disorienting shock to foreigners who come from business cultures where contracts are legally binding and  schedules are not a casual subject.,0.98958313,0.010203821,0.00021309961

"Higher Management lives in a cocoon of privilege and as a result are arrogant dismissive and careless. They are also completely lacking in selfawareness. Cultlike.  Annual Performance is generally judged based on other's perceptions of you and what you do not the work you actually do. This means that your hours of toil on a project mean nothing if someone in a 'higher' role than you reports something negative about you; doesn't matter if it is true or not.  The organization does not practice the values they claim to preach: BC preaches diversity and inclusion but 90% of the higher management is white male and British. Preach about the importance of mental health/worklife balance but managers will expect 5060 hour workweeks to prove your commitment.  Finally and by far the most frustrating; the lack of any serious accountability. Finger pointing and blame is commonplace. Serious mistakes never come with consequences for the person that made them; was personally told on multiple occasions that ""the British Council"" was accountable for clerical/accounting/financial/scheduling errors.

Once you're overseas you're pretty much on your own because the CIEE folks are located in the major cities while most teachers are placed in remote locations.

 Schedule.  Grueling schedule of 16 teaching hours 3 semesters almost no breaks.  In addition expected to do dozens of hours of other things including Proctoring other people's exams Grading Internships Doing Research Attending Open House Attending Orientations and more.  Keep in mind there are three semesters so you're doing all this X 3.  Management is absolutely terrible.  The mostly Indian management team are constantly adding to the work load with bureaucratic nonsense and busy work in a vain attempt to show 'they are doing something'.   This includes forcing lecturers to come in during holidays and breaks when there are no classes or meetings.   Faculty Morale is at an all time low (primarily due to the above) which is impacting teaching and making students frustrated as well.  Micromanaging classes.  In yet another vain attempt to show 'they are doing something' to the new Chinese owners they are Micro managing exams lecturers teaching styles and even the syllabi.
