They are also completely lacking in self-awareness. Cult-like.\r\n\r\nAnnual Performance is generally judged based on other's perceptions of you and what you do, not the work you actually do. This means that your hours of toil on a project mean nothing if someone in a 'higher' role than you reports something negative about you; doesn't matter if it is true or not.\r\n\r\nThe organization does not practice the values they claim to preach: BC preaches diversity and inclusion but 90% of the higher management is white, male and British. Preach about the importance of mental health/work-life balance, but managers will expect 50-60 hour workweeks to prove your commitment.\r\n\r\nFinally and by far the most frustrating; the lack of any serious accountability. Finger pointing and blame is commonplace. Serious mistakes never come with consequences for the person that made them; was personally told on multiple occasions that \"the British Council\" was accountable for clerical/accounting/financial/scheduling errors. Everyone is accountable so no one ended up being accountable."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Overall working experience", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 May 2021", "job_title": "Customer Management Executive in Bangkok", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good benefits and remuneration packages.
