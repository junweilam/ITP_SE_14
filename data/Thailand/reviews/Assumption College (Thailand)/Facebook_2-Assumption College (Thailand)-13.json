Additionally, teachers are likely to be blamed when the complains arise and are monitored closely to watch teacher's behavior. This result with no improvement in teaching methodology.\n\nThis is the kind of employer that focus on teacher's flaws and issues rather than working with teachers to better the teaching outcomes. The kind of employer that order the tasks and mandate regulations for teachers to follow and ensure they keep their mouths shut and do as told. Hence, you will always be wrong as a teacher at Assumption College Bangrak.\n\n3. Students are your customers not pupils. Your job is to make them happy at all cost.

It was clear that Assumption College pays close attention to such details and ensures that public functions showcase these facilities to parents and other visitors.", "cons": "Interview process: The initial conversation was rather vague, and informal questioning continued (with additional staff members) after the interview proper. \r\n\r\nIt seemed that the team was not familiar with how to interview candidates appropriately.\r\n\r\nAdministration & management: Organisation was severely lacking. Teachers' class and duty schedules changed almost daily. Teachers and other staff were added and removed from classes and duty periods constantly. Communication is poor and often contradictory, with various middle managers offering conflicting instructions.\r\n\r\nCommunications: Instead of following modern standards (e-mail) or even older norms (paper memo), the school relies on a messaging app (Line) to share information, ask staff to take on additional duties, or to call for meetings. This results in staff routinely checking their phones, sometimes even during classes, which is disruptive to the learning environment.\r\n\r\nFacilities: Staff room and classrooms were old and in disrepair. The air conditioning units went out almost daily. Computers and AV equipment were quite dated and sometimes experienced technical difficulties. Oftentimes, multiple buildings' restroom facilities were out of order, causing staff to cross campus to simply wash hands or use the toilet. Even when working, most restrooms routinely lacked basic toilet paper and soap.\r\n\r\nWorkload: The total number of subjects and levels far exceeded the normal amount assigned to teachers in Western countries. The total number of teaching hours was reasonable, but having to prepare, teach, and mark papers for such a large number of subjects and levels was unusual.\r\n\r\nStudent learning: Many students were academically unprepared for the grade levels and courses that they were in, which hinted at a lack of adequate academic preparation and rigor in earlier years.\r\n\r\nStudent behaviour: At both the primary & secondary levels, a majority of students were routinely off-task, out of their seats, shouting, and disruptive. School policy permits nothing more than a verbal request to return to study, which students routinely ignore. A lack of administrative support in this area causes a poor learning environment and diminished learning on the part of all students.\r\n\r\nStudent safety: Students administer their own medications throughout the day without the supervision of the school nurse or other medical professional. Play fighting, wrestling, and physical altercations were considered normal at the school. Both primary and secondary students had paper cutting blades and would often play with them both during and after classes. In spite of repeated reports to administration on these issues, it appears that management is not concerned about student safety.\r\n\r\nOther: The HR & Finance departments take a monthly 'deposit' of 2,000 THB during the first year of employment. They say that this is their policy to ensure that teachers stay at Assumption and do not leave without notice.
