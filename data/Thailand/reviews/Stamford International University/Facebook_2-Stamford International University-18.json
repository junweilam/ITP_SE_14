Keep in mind, there are three semesters so you're doing all this X 3.\r\n- Management is absolutely terrible.  The mostly Indian management team are constantly adding to the work load with bureaucratic nonsense and busy work in a vain attempt to show 'they are doing something'.   This includes forcing lecturers to come in, during holidays and breaks, when there are no classes or meetings. \r\n- Faculty Morale is at an all time low (primarily due to the above) which is impacting teaching and making students frustrated as well. \r\n-Micromanaging classes.  In yet another vain attempt to show 'they are doing something' to the new Chinese owners, they are Micro managing exams, lecturers, teaching styles, and even the syllabi.   The result has been a cookie cutter format for teaching that drowns students in busy work while killing any notion of creativity and new thought."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "A very good place to work.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Lecturer in Bangkok", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It was a positive environment.
