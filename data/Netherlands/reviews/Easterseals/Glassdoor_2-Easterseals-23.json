It seems as though Easter Seals is a front for the pyramid scheme, Amway. The many great people were outshined by the shady characters that passed through the board and staff over the years. Nonprofits are typically understaffed so work life balance is not as great as one may assume and capable employees often did 3+ jobs and then also took on the work load of non-capable employees. As a results the work environment often was quite stressful, overwhelming and disorganized. \r\nHowever, most of the good people are now long gone anyway. I feel terrible for the few that are still left. Success was also measured in a very antiquated way. The little data and financial information we did have access to was always a mess."}], []]
