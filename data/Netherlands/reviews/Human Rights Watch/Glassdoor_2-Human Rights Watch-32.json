Extremely long hours, intense daily schedule, extra hours are NOT paid, taking compensation time for the extra hours is frowned upon and hard to do, questionable and non-transparent ways of deciding what topic the organization deals with. Payment is very low, after covering the living expenses you are left with nothing (working poor). Limited opportunities for professional development.  Interns are UNPAID.  Internship positions are given out as favours."}], []]
