In other words: if you are a researcher affiliated to the hospital, your priviliges (working time, salary, etc.) are simply better as compared as when you work at the faculty. This difference will only become clear to you when you are member of a department that belongs both in the faculty and the hospital. In this way, one can claim that different 'classes' of researchers are being created (one being more valued than the other); to be fair, if you belong to the good class (=the hospital researchers), you will be treated very well (working time, salary, appreciation by colleagues), if you belong to the other category.... - The amount of education hours that you are (normally) asked to perform in this faculty is insane (+800 hours a year in case of 1.0 fte appointment) - Internal politics unfortunately destroys the possibility for fair, open and transparent culture. Key positions are held only by Dutch people and all management related meetings (lower, middle and higher management) are held in Dutch (even in the presence of non-Dutch speaking individuals). This is opposite to the culture of internationalisation and diversity which the Faculty pretends to carry out to the outside world. - Overwork and burn-out rate at the faculty is sky-high since implementation of 0.5fte education performance for full-time researcher (in 2015)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Standard PhD Work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Apr 2023", "job_title": "PhD Student in Maastricht", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice colleagues, flexible work hours, interesting studies.", "cons": "Project management is mostly not present and actual workload always underestimated."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Volunteer work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "23 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Student Ambassador in Maastricht", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The university has clear organisation skills", "cons": "It can take some time away"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Facilities", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "PhD Candidate in Maastricht", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Laptop and working-from-home equipment offered.", "cons": "Uninspiring, dull, and outdated interior."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Very good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Student Ambassador in Maastricht", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice atmosphere and good salary", "cons": "Can't name any cons right now"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Maastricht university tutor", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Tutor in Maastricht", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good opportunity for a student that want to work part time.
