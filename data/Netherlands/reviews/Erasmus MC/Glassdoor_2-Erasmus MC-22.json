My impression is that many projects take way longer than they should because of this. I always have the illusion that it's better in some other departments but I'm told by my boss that this is an ErasmusMC wide issue. I think they mean specifically an issue of the way too many people that call themselves manager or advisor. -Culture where a certain type of person that became manager or advisor is not fired despite of contributing very little to the organisation, due partly to Dutch labor regulations but perhaps mostly due to the fact that some elements of the organization seem to be more focused on appearances than on results, at least compared to, say, a startup. But maybe this is a feature of big organizations, I heard similar stories about big automotive."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4,
