Most of the good Dutch student I know taught themselves from the internet other than from the lectures. \r\n\r\nWith the Optics Research Group:\r\n- Research projects are not well-defined and planned. A direct result is most of the PhDs extended their project (mostly without financial support). Until now, the last two PhDs took 5+ years to graduate (a standard contract is four year). There are 9 PhDs currently exceeds four years. They have to either support themselves to graduate or find a job first.\r\n- Research topics within the group are rather scattered. This results in an isolated working style.\r\n- Some projects are not well defined from the beginning. I am puzzled how do they get the research grant in this way.  I feel that some projects are only roughly defined and only when they hired the person, they start to work on defining the project. Most of the projects have deviated from the research topic they originally have. \r\n- An atmosphere that the PhDs feel the supervisors are not competent, at the same time the supervisors are blaming the PhDs are not good enough, which results in a lack of mutual trust. This is very toxic to any working environment. There is no synergy within the group.    \r\n- politics and conflicts between the supervisors resulting in very difficult situations for the PhDs.\r\n- the group starts to hire lots of obedient Asian students, which kill the diversity of the group a bit. \r\n- The group leader is rather busy and frequently no-show for the meetings (without notice).\r\n- Some of the people are following last-minute working ethic.  \r\n- Expectations are not clear in the group. From my experience, I feel they want you to be extremely independent and autonomous. However, they are not communicating it clearly and neither do they train you in that way.
