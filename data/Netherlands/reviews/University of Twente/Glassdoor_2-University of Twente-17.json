If your work output is good, you can expect an annual raise conform the VSNU CAO.\r\n+ The campus is located just outside the city of Enschede which means accessibility (via car, train or bike) is excellent. BMS employees are usually stationed in one of the newer buildings (Ravelijn) which is characterised by a lot of natural incoming light and well-equipped offices. PhD's are often grouped into a single office, while teachers and (assistent) professors typically have their own offices. Unfortunately, some of the offices, especially those in the inner ring of the Ravelijn building do not have access to an outside view or natural air circulation.\r\n+ Individual departments enjoy a lot of support from skilled IT staff and facility management.

Regular personal feedback about one's work is not provided in general, unless asked for specifically by junior staff. Overall, goals and responsiblities for new PhD's can be vague within BMS and is typically restricted to \"finish your PhD in time and publish as many high impact papers as you can humanly muster within said time. Also, teach these courses next semester. And do not forget to attain your BKO/UTQ qualification ASAP\". Department heads should exhibit better leadership in guiding and coaching juniors towards (1) developing a professional mindset and finding workflows that enables the production of meaningful work-output on a daily basis.
