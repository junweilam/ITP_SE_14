Within AIESEC the sky's the limit. I got challenging role after challenging role and was always encouraged to set ambitious goals for myself. I got the responsibilities of a CMO at age 23 and joined industry conferences where I was the youngest participant. I learned about marketing strategy and data but also about my own passions strengths and values.,0.027874896,0.97015923,0.001965886
I really had to strictly prioritize and plan in order to not get overworked. There were so many things to do (both work and fun) that it kind of took over my life.

AIESEC is an organisation where young people get to develop themselves on a daily basis. There is a lot of space for initiatives taken by employees. Furthermore you get many responsibilities at a young age and you get to work with motivated people who are always eager to learn.,0.0005444048,0.0005401785,0.99891543

Very clear vision. Collaborative culture fostered by hundreds of (national and international) conferences every year. Members are ambitious young people and students who put in their freetime in order to make the world a better place step by step. AIESEC is all about leadership development literally every part of the organization is connected with developing young people into better leaders for the world of tomorrow.  Almost 100000 board members each year presence in 128 countries.  Feedback session training sessions workshops by big international companies. Learn how to work in teams learn how to lead teams learn how to do sales etc. etc. etc.  It really is the perfect organization to develop the practical skills you do not learn at university in the classroom but which you definitely need later on in your career.  Last but not least make friends in every corner of the globe and become part of a huge global network of AIESECers with currently over 1000000 alumni and growing every year.,0.0005362413,0.0008967035,0.99856704
Sometimes people are too focused on the vision and therefore lose sight of daily operational activities. Furthermore continuity can be a problem as new board members come in every year. But it is amazing how AIESEC can manage this there is no other organization in the world which completely turns around its whole management and employee positions. This is because you will only be in a position for a term of one year after that you move on to a higher position; allowing fast development and fosters entrepreneurial spirit within the organization.,0.16235055,0.44275975,0.39488968

"AIESEC has several values but unfortunately they are not lived on an everyday basis it almost feels like it is just to show others. AIESEC says it is supposed to act sustainable but they meet twice a year in a 2 week conference in a 5 star hotel in a 5 start event a lot of money is spent on it which could be used for a better purpose. Also AIESEC has been partnering with some companies which do not share the same values as AIESEC including mining and oil companies. Even though AIESEC says it is not political the organization itself is extremely political where people which have never achieved anything or done anything major get elected for higher positions and even president just because they ""know people"".  Basically AIESEC is a lot of talking and not acting it does not walk the talk",0.99818087,0.0016606735,0.00015854533

The excutive board was a mess. They don't take responsibility for their mistakes and completely disregard the values of AIESEC.

For me what it came down to was having to chose between investing my spare time to keep delivering quality or chose to lower quality of my work. Sometimes I choose to protect my own time but on the whole I struggled each time I foresaw letting down my colleagues/students which then came at the expense of my own happiness and health.,0.99874985,0.00110549,0.00014465133
The people at this place are genuinely fun to work with and the students (as might be expected) are fantastic. All the outward aspects of the job are excellent. The offices are very nice benefits are good and salary is on the high side of average for this kind of job.,0.0008012729,0.0016544469,0.9975442
The only issue I have with my position here is that management has recently decided to sacrifice quality for money. They look at it as a necessary sacrifice to preserve the school. I understand the reason but don't like being a part of it. If they cannot survive honestly then maybe another job would be better.,0.9984451,0.0014231883,0.00013180556

It seems that the university considers superficially the technical skills of the candidates when recruiting permanent staff. Therefore very highly skilled professors are rare!!

As in all universities professors take the place of managers.  Many professors lack even basic management and interpersonal skills and as long as their groups produce enough highly cited papers there appears to be no incentive for them to improve.  Bad behaviour is acceptable if citation counts remain high.  As a researcher you are completely beholden to your professor.  Thus if you end up in a group where the professor behaves badly you will either need to develop a thick skin or leave.  Professors get to decide on many aspects related to your work environment including your computer.  Many skimp on these basic items which impedes productivity.  Food on campus is bland and expensive.,0.9985422,0.0012742574,0.00018359328

With over 10 publications as a PhD student (at another institute) and NONE as a PostDoc at TU Delft my career is basically at a frustrating standstill.

If you decide to do a PhD at TU Delft be prepared to pay for part of it yourself. If something goes wrong and you cannot finish your PhD within 4 years you have to find means of finance yourself.

Financial problems have led to merging of my Master tracks from 3 to one in addition to decrease in the number of professors. Consequently I am forced to attend subjects in which I am not interested.

I will write this in two parts: the experience with the university and the experience with the research group (Optics Research Group). My rating is mainly based on my experience with the research group.  With the University: Excellent facilities ICT support is perfect good reputation lots of inspired events and activities very international sports and culture event is terrific and I love the library.  For the Optics Research Group:  Lots of office space the group leader has a good network in the Dutch and European optical societies; the atmosphere is very flexible and relaxed (no pressure it can be a con which I will write later).,0.0005518141,0.0066425656,0.99280566
I will write this in two parts: the experience with the university and the experience with the research group (Optics Research Group). My rating is mainly based on my experience with the research group.  With the university:   The lectures are not so well organized and taught. Most of the good Dutch student I know taught themselves from the internet other than from the lectures.   With the Optics Research Group:  Research projects are not welldefined and planned. A direct result is most of the PhDs extended their project (mostly without financial support). Until now the last two PhDs took 5 years to graduate (a standard contract is four year). There are 9 PhDs currently exceeds four years. They have to either support themselves to graduate or find a job first.  Research topics within the group are rather scattered. This results in an isolated working style.  Some projects are not well defined from the beginning. I am puzzled how do they get the research grant in this way.  I feel that some projects are only roughly defined and only when they hired the person they start to work on defining the project. Most of the projects have deviated from the research topic they originally have.   An atmosphere that the PhDs feel the supervisors are not competent at the same time the supervisors are blaming the PhDs are not good enough which results in a lack of mutual trust. This is very toxic to any working environment. There is no synergy within the group.      politics and conflicts between the supervisors resulting in very difficult situations for the PhDs.  the group starts to hire lots of obedient Asian students which kill the diversity of the group a bit.   The group leader is rather busy and frequently noshow for the meetings (without notice).  Some of the people are following lastminute working ethic.    Expectations are not clear in the group. From my experience I feel they want you to be extremely independent and autonomous. However they are not communicating it clearly and neither do they train you in that way. Unless you are a very independent and autonomous person that know how you are going the conduct your research in four years and having all the necessary resources prepared I do not suggest the PhD experience in this group.,0.998524,0.0013202159,0.00015586811

Pay is laughable (yes I know it's a nonprofit) especially for the location. The offices were below working standards again even for a nonprofit.  It seems as though Easter Seals is a front for the pyramid scheme Amway. The many great people were outshined by the shady characters that passed through the board and staff over the years. Nonprofits are typically understaffed so work life balance is not as great as one may assume and capable employees often did 3 jobs and then also took on the work load of noncapable employees. As a results the work environment often was quite stressful overwhelming and disorganized.  However most of the good people are now long gone anyway. I feel terrible for the few that are still left. Success was also measured in a very antiquated way. The little data and financial information we did have access to was always a mess.,0.9983878,0.0014369222,0.00017534886

Culture of a lot of meetings (not rarely continuing for years) with too many people and too little preparation and too little concrete action points (of course this might vary depending on the person(s) involved and or in charge of a project). My impression is that many projects take way longer than they should because of this. I always have the illusion that it's better in some other departments but I'm told by my boss that this is an ErasmusMC wide issue. I think they mean specifically an issue of the way too many people that call themselves manager or advisor. Culture where a certain type of person that became manager or advisor is not fired despite of contributing very little to the organisation due partly to Dutch labor regulations but perhaps mostly due to the fact that some elements of the organization seem to be more focused on appearances than on results at least compared to say a startup. But maybe this is a feature of big organizations I heard similar stories about big automotive.,0.9952112,0.0046298434,0.00015901212

 Constantly PhD students and early stage personell were asked to correct and finalize EMLE master transcripts and correct other law program transcripts. Nowhere was it announced that transcripts would be corrected by unqualified PhD Students nor were the students aware of the course content or have had expertise in different facets of the subject matter being corrected.  We saw this as an unnecessary burden as it took lot of time away from our core research. Many channelled this anger towards the poor students in lower levels of education.  The EMLE/EDLE and Erasmus School of Law Programs as well as the university organization as a whole is full of principalagent problems. Several reorganizations are necessary to correct these problems. Ironically every course talked about identifying and correcting principalagent problems. The University and especially EMLE/EDLE is full of such moral dilemma.  Students are underserved here no effort or funds allocated to student and staff development even though the program fees are 12000€ on average and can be as high as 59000€ for RSM programs.  University is super quick to deenroll  students and put them in a limbo and force them not to have any access to EU wide and Erasmus schemes for which the students still have the right to but for this ridiculous university.  Appeals procedure exists on paper but it goes on forever without an outcome/solution as the university is understaffed does not divert funds to important support services or staff development.,0.9987753,0.0010791774,0.00014555173

The research budget is very limited. Reimbursement is too slow. Sometimes you need to wait several months to get the money back. It might come from the bad managerial structure. Moreover The faculty does not support the PhD students too much.  There are very limited opportunities to meet and talk with other senior researchers.

It's hard to imagine a worse employer than GRI. Pisspoor management from top to  bottom. GRI is unable to retain top talent because of bad management. The voluntary employee turnover rate is over 50%. Check GRI's annual report. It is publicly available. GRI's salaries are low no pension they do not fully cover travel costs there are no training or career growth opportunities nothing. A few nice people work there but also a lot of seriously mean and spiteful weirdos. The work environment is toxic. The sick rate is extremely high and many many people are sat home on burnouts or only working part of the week because of stress.

Poor leadership! The Senior Leadership Team has not shown the willingness to act upon clear issues that have been factually laid out in front of them at several times. Kissing up to the boss will get you much further than actually doing your job and placing the best interest of the IB first; so if you're the very political type you should just identify the people that you need to kiss up to and you'll be fine.  The IB has an educational business but at the end of the day it is a business so decisions need to be made by people who actually understand the business/financial implications of the decisions they make. Educational people are not business people as much as they want to believe that they are. As a responsible and engaged employee it's tough to see all the money and resources wasted with very little accountability and consequences pointing it out leads to being labelled a negative person.,0.9973997,0.002429669,0.0001706474

If IB students are looking for a future career somewhere that models the values of their education they should keep on looking  because sadly they will not find the Learner Profile or spirit of inquiry living and breathing in the culture of the IB. Creative talented people are drawn in by the powerful (and externally visible) mission and vision only to find the day to day processes and senior leadership so uninspiring they either leave or stay and accept defeat. I am truly saddened that such an organisation cannot  and will not  recognise its shortcomings or take action (in true IB style) to practice what it preaches. A waste of talent energy time and worst of all  as a not for profit  money that it should be ploughing back into its products and services for schools around the world.,0.9963253,0.0033619232,0.0003127827

"I've been at the IB for a year and a half. The IB has a high standing in the educational world. In the past I believe that was combined with a slightly bureaucratic standoffish statusconscious way of doing things but that's definitely changing. Professionally my experience so far has been rewarding. I think I can help improve things here in terms of bringing in an outside perspective  and I can honestly say that I have been challenged (and never bored) here.  The IB has an overriding Mission  ""Education for a better world"": everything the organization does is aimed to that end. This sounds simple but the IB is not a simple organization with a sometimes confusing complexity in its working structures. This is something the management is acting on and there is a refreshing hunger for change in the organization.  For the most part colleagues are open friendly hardworking and intelligent. Working conditions and benefits (overall) are good. It is a welldesigned office in a good part of town  quiet international with good shopping nearby.  The new DG Dr Siva Kumari who joined shortly before I did works hard to make it less hierarchical and processdriven. The leadership team supporting her are fairly new to their jobs. New senior IT people are improving the infrastructure.  All in all it's a time of change with all the reactions you'd expect internally and externally.  The main criticism is that salaries seem quite low  HR have an unshakeable grip on this and on job development  this may also be changing because otherwise there'd be a problem to attract and retain the best.

We do very basic work (processing chapters and writing news). Opportunities for development are very limited. Even if you get a promotion you do the same work.  The work culture is quite negative. People are afraid to speak their opinions. If you criticize or complain you will be fired. There is a lot of unequal and unfair treatment. If your boss likes you you get all benefits (going to conferences doing courses). This unfair treatment is possible as there are no written policies. Bad leadership is a problem. Some people do very little work and this is tolerated. Many people would like to leave but it's difficult to find jobs for foreigners in Netherlands.,0.9989047,0.0009406868,0.00015459419

 In case of a permanent position The pro's all depend whether you are able to work in the hospital as researcher or not; if you will work in the hospital your timeschedule can be quite flexible you can choose what you like to focus on and the new recognition and rewards system will allow you to develop yourself in directions that you can choose yourself.,0.00039173104,0.99820614,0.001402095
 The dissynchronization of the hospital and the faculty lead to unfair and disbalanced management decisions. In other words: if you are a researcher affiliated to the hospital your priviliges (working time salary etc.) are simply better as compared as when you work at the faculty. This difference will only become clear to you when you are member of a department that belongs both in the faculty and the hospital. In this way one can claim that different 'classes' of researchers are being created (one being more valued than the other); to be fair if you belong to the good class (=the hospital researchers) you will be treated very well (working time salary appreciation by colleagues) if you belong to the other category....  The amount of education hours that you are (normally) asked to perform in this faculty is insane (800 hours a year in case of 1.0 fte appointment)  Internal politics unfortunately destroys the possibility for fair open and transparent culture. Key positions are held only by Dutch people and all management related meetings (lower middle and higher management) are held in Dutch (even in the presence of nonDutch speaking individuals). This is opposite to the culture of internationalisation and diversity which the Faculty pretends to carry out to the outside world.  Overwork and burnout rate at the faculty is skyhigh since implementation of 0.5fte education performance for fulltime researcher (in 2015).,0.9951389,0.004594772,0.00026633454

The students at Maastricht University are overall very motivated to participate and take a stake in their education. This does not apply to all students equally of course but on average I would say that this aspect is a little better than many other universities. It makes teaching here much more pleasant. The Problem Based learning approach facilitates this and it is an intense but fruitful approach to teaching in my experience. As an employee the standard benefits of working at a Dutch university apply which is good enough.,0.0022220197,0.074495524,0.92328244
The university still relies too heavily on temporary contracts that may (or may not) be renewed after two year periods. It would be better if permanent contracts/tenure were offered at an earlier stage. This would not only benefit the employees but also their loyalty to the university and the continuity of quality teaching and research.

1. Very often it takes 10 people to get things moving and only one to stop... frustrating if you want to rock'n roll and get a job done quickly 2.

Many staff can hide well behind their desks as the organisation is big and not looking well into the actual performance of each staff. 6. Less voices given to many capable national staff,0.99884003,0.0010082077,0.00015179593

This is not specifically targeted at the TUe but I really learned how terrible working in academia is in the netherlands. In my opinion it's a bad salary with no job certainty and little perspective to job certainty in the future combined with a fairly high pressure to perform better than the rest. The only answer given to the question why these conditions are so bad is usually that it has always been like this (which is not an answer I expect from a scientist) while at the same time every professor keeps telling me that everything was not so diffcult when they were in that situation a few years back..,0.9966535,0.0031918436,0.00015468862

As opposed to research PhD/postdoc positions in the US in the Netherlands you are treated not as a student but a professional researcher. You get paid a salary and also many competitive benefits that support your work and life in general such as fullcoverage grants for internships abroad at worldclass renowned universities extra budget for professional trainings (academic leadership) trainings for personal development (presentation skills language) equipment and materials options for converting part of your salary to buying brand new bikes for travel to and from work every 3 years etc. Most interestingly there is great support from university to support commercializing your research results in the form of a hightech startup. This is enabled through close collaboration with industry (i.e. with Dutch companies such as Philips ASML Oce  Canon TomTom) during the research phase.,0.0006725485,0.0007343315,0.99859315
You have to be persistent in making your way through some bureaucracy to reap the abovementioned benefits and be ready to face some internal politics common to governmental organizations.

Usually I would say that dynamic is good but the rapidly changing PhD projects in this research group often does not leave any space for the internal collaboration (everyone work on his/her own). The group severely lacks knowledge transfer  the experience accumulated over years by a PhD or Postdoc. often got dissipated as there is little or no temporal overlap with the successor project (if one even exists).,0.9970854,0.0027412083,0.00017342193
1. It's a great opportunity for foreign software engineers to join the dutch labour market. 2.

Very good university but not the best compared to TU Delft. So you might find that most of the (best) research resources available in the Netherlands have been absorbed into TUD or other high ranking universities.

I was a PhD candidate in the social sciences and I had a great time working on my dissertation at Utrecht University. My colleagues were genuinely helpful and collaborative people have lunch together and they provide honest and constructive feedback on your work. Almost every PhD student I know there has been productive in terms of publishing without being too overworked or stressed. Everyone of my cohort found a great job after graduating!,0.00021614989,0.00044126483,0.9993426
My department was very quantitative in orientation so if you want to do qualitative research you should research the possibilities for doing so and finding peers who are also open to it first. Also the research is very streamlined into the kinds of studies the department does best so you have to be on board with that!,0.0010686731,0.99830544,0.00062580133
A large organisation like the UU allows you to pick colleagues with whom to collaborate. You want hyperfocussed and knowledgable nerds? Plenty around. You want smart people with eye for workprivate balance? Got loads of them too! Most comfortable around people who are poor at their job and try to reach pension with minimal effort? Unfortunately there are quite a few of them as well. But hey to a large extent you can pick your collaborators!,0.9342916,0.06468896,0.0010193898
A large organisation like the UU is heterogeneous. Important is the Faculty you work for. Science Rebo in general have a name to have a pleasant atmosphere. Vet. med. has a reputation to be archaic in hierarchy as well as in (fundamental) science.,0.9337851,0.06559889,0.0006160064
The work you do directly benefits students attending Utrecht University helping them in their studies. Evaluating courses and lecturers by looking at grades and the way students evaluate their discipline of choice ensuring a consistent and high quality curriculum is something I enjoyed.  Also work life balance is great. Yes sometimes you need to put in some extra overhours but in general working hours are very manageable. You work a lot more if you become project leader on a specific study but still working hours are less than at most private firms. Working from home is also no problem.  Colleages come from all walks of life and are (in general) pretty nice. I met some great people I also enjoy seeing outside of working hours.  Salary and benefits are also good. You get a big discount on a public transportation fees (NS Jaarabonnement) and can make use of all kinds of University facilities like the Olympos sportfacility for a minimal fee. It is also possible to attend courses at Utrecht University for a reduced fee.,0.00033978096,0.00058301864,0.9990772
As is common with Dutch Universities the topdown management structure of Utrecht University can sometimes be slow to respond to a situation and only after lots of meetings and decision making rounds. This can sometimes be frustrating. If it is clear that a certain situation needs a certain systematic solution it can be hard to breaking through the system of meetingsandevaluations to quickly respond. Sometimes it reminds you of what Jiskefet used to joke about.  Although there is room for personal growth the range of available options for personal development is more limited than at say a privately held company. Being a University there is less pressure to maximize the value of each of its employees than at a private company.,0.99581534,0.003976048,0.00020862486
Good scientific knowledge level nice collegues lots of freedom many links with other national and international universities and companies. I had many opportunities to go to conferences and follow courses inside the Netherlands and abroad. I even had the opportunity to spend a month in the US.

Bad management. Attempted to suppress complaints about academic fraud on a purely nepotistic grounds and refused to investigate based on the facts. Nobody within management stood up to these practices; the then dean of science Karen Maex chiefly responsible for these practices is now promoted to rector magnificus (where she is hard at work botching the forced UvAVU merger; another budgetary black hole and minefield to keep in mind when considering the UvA as an employer).   Science is generally not a pretty place to be in given the shrinking budgets in recent years; while I was never looking for a permanent position there myself the people that are are consistently lied to by management. They have an effective hiring stop which creates a lot of stress for aspiring tenure trackers. That is probably the same everywhere but the lies and intimidations that some of my colleagues had to suffer is not. From what I have seen worldwide the predatory culture at the UvA is in a league of its own and shows no signs of improving.   Obviously I would not recommend working there but hey you are a scientists so you'll take what you can get. But if you must work there anyway: at least know that the people on the other end of your contract are acutely aware of that dynamic as well.

The master programs are high level so working with students is great here too.,0.00022291981,0.00032178368,0.9994553
The organisation has gone through some turmoil due to student and staff protests against budget cuts and austerity measures. Especially in smaller fields educational programmes and research might disappear. Money is always tight there are not many tenured positions and even a hiring stop for 2015. Almost all research in the Netherlands has projectbased funding.,0.9989772,0.00088804396,0.00013479602
A lot of freedom depending on department head attitude. Limited training offered although any course can be followed (without formal recognition). Office culture mostly informal hardly hierarchy open innovative attitude with respect to research and research topics. One of the top universities in the EU; Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences ranks number 1.,0.84802985,0.115642235,0.0363279
Loyalty is not rewarded with loyalty. The UvA will accept your efforts for teaching courses as easily as they dispose of you. There's absolutely no support or guidance for beginning lecturers. None. You're thrown in front of a class and you're expected to be able and capable of teaching the course. No one ever asks you how you're doing. Only the students get to fill out an evaluation form right after the exam.,0.9983022,0.0015108805,0.0001867947
First of all I needed the money to fund my prePHD studies. The pay was very good taking into account that it was only a 10 hours per week contract. On top of that the Dutch Government adds a nice work subsidy for students working parttime. The Schedule was fairly flexible and people were straightforward and open.,0.00052302715,0.0009916608,0.9984854
IT facilities are fairly bad with unnecessary restrictions that can hamper one's work. The buildings are gloomy and close down too early so there's limited opportunity to stay late and get things finally done when you're in a good work mood.,0.99476,0.0044732,0.00076675974
The UvA is a great place if you value creative and personal freedom. The culture at the UvA is one of open intellectual freedom which makes it a great university for a researcher who knows what he wants to do and how he wants to do it.,0.00018230538,0.00035577262,0.99946195

During my studies at the UvA I've always been able to find some nice parttime job at the UvA to be more involved in the university and to earn some money. Salary is decent as a student you are being paid according to some fixed scale.,0.01087745,0.123404555,0.86571795

The possibilities for a postdoc or teaching positions at the UvA are very seldom.  The university does not seem to  be doing an effort to improve the work spaces on the contrary the work space is getting worse and more noisy.,0.9990163,0.00082441675,0.00015920977

I used to work at ITC as an student employee during three years. The institute attracts students from all continents while the majority employees  are Dutch. I feel there is a healthy mix of cultures and that it is celebrated. Often events are organised which stimulate meeting  each other.   I atmosphere is openminded and people are always willing to strike up a conversation.   There is a canteen which serves tasty and affordable lunch.,0.00024494843,0.00063528935,0.9991198

 The UT offers excellent secondary working conditions such as a free sport pass (e.g. tennis soccer swimming gym memberships) a bike plan decent pension accrual via ABP 13th month bonus options to trade salary or vacation days for extend leave (e.g. sabbatical) option to buy more vacation days contribution to home internet costs UT laptop (and sometimes also a phone) and travel/conference/personal learning budgets.   Healthcare in general is organised rather well in the Netherlands however it is a big plus that the UT has a healthcare centre located on campus (physician dentist psychologists fysiotherapists etc.). Depending on the department employees can expect to have a lot of say in to where (from home/office) and how they work (flexible hours).   The salary is decent but it's hard to negotiate a higher salary as compared to industry jobs because of the collective labour agreement (CAO) for government workers. If you bring a lot of industry experience and are switching to academia  negotiating a higher salary is possible to a certain extent. If your work output is good you can expect an annual raise conform the VSNU CAO.  The campus is located just outside the city of Enschede which means accessibility (via car train or bike) is excellent. BMS employees are usually stationed in one of the newer buildings (Ravelijn) which is characterised by a lot of natural incoming light and wellequipped offices. PhD's are often grouped into a single office while teachers and (assistent) professors typically have their own offices. Unfortunately some of the offices especially those in the inner ring of the Ravelijn building do not have access to an outside view or natural air circulation.  Individual departments enjoy a lot of support from skilled IT staff and facility management. The employees of the secretariats are often very serviceminded and willing to perform any requested administrative support or other officerelated tasks. (e.g. booking conference hotels ordering lab equipment fasttracking student assistant applications etc.).,0.018810686,0.035072763,0.94611657
" Some departments are understaffed with regards to teaching responsibilities which means that often even research staff have to allocate a big portion of their time to teaching. Depending on the department structural overtime is required each week (I am not sure if overtime is paid or unpaid).  Depending on the department junior staff (PhD's junior teachers etc.) may feel ""lost"" as to what their goals and priorities should be. Regular personal feedback about one's work is not provided in general unless asked for specifically by junior staff. Overall goals and responsiblities for new PhD's can be vague within BMS and is typically restricted to ""finish your PhD in time and publish as many high impact papers as you can humanly muster within said time. Also teach these courses next semester. And do not forget to attain your BKO/UTQ qualification ASAP"". Department heads should exhibit better leadership in guiding and coaching juniors towards (1) developing a professional mindset and finding workflows that enables the production of meaningful workoutput on a daily basis. A little more personal attention and structure will go a long way in attaining young talents.  What is this magical ""permanent contract"" you are speaking about?
