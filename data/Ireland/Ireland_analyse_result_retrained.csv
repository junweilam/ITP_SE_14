Managers in theatre are incompetent and very unprofessional. They gossip about other staff. They try to change protocols that doesn't make any sense. They pressure staff to work faster so they could admit more patients for surgery. I bet theyre getting commission out of add ons. High turnover of staff and they think it's because it's cheaper to leave the hospital and work in the country side when the truth is it's really just a terrible place to work in.

I’m giving this place one star because I can’t give it less. This is one of the most toxic and unprofessional places I have worked in. Like someone stated if you are currently interviewing with the company or have a formal offer please reconsider. If you are a person of colour avoid this place. Opportunities for people of colour is limited despite the noise they make about equality and diversity. I got employed there during the lock down and working remotely didn’t get to experience their toxicity. With the lifting of COVID restrictions and a return to the office I got to witness everything. What I thought was a professional setting turned out to be a place rife with gossip jealousy bullying and pettiness. There is this emphasis on making friends which is about the only criteria you need to get a promotion or other opportunities. It’s not uncommon to frequently overhear hushed gossiping about someone or acts to undermine someone because that person doesn’t move the way the group wants or the person got recognized by a superior. Pretty much like a high school. During a meeting where I was talking I once caught a senior colleague making gestures at me to another when he thought I wasn’t looking. It’s not uncommon to have a manager who really doesn’t know what he/she is doing and will try to cover up their inefficiencies by throwing those they are supervising under the bus. The culture at Concern is one of the worst with some of the most disturbing and unprofessional behaviour I have ever seen. For the clueless HR department an equally toxic unit the solution to this is to organize periodic meetups where everyone is literally forced to sit through 30minute meetups where everyone pretends to be friends have coffee and make small talk.

DBS is a vibrant and dynamic environment to challenge yourself and grow both personally and professionally.   There has been significant positive change in the last 12 months since the change of leadership. Some engagement groups have been established and communication throughout the college has improved immensely.  Your ideas and suggestions are always welcomed and taken on board by managers and senior management.  Collegiality across all departments is one of my favourite things about working here. Every month a different department hosts a “cake break” which gives us a chance to meet and talk to people that we might not necessarily have the opportunity to converse with outside of our daily jobs. This initiative has been running for the past 6 months and has greatly improved internal networking.  There are numerous social events throughout the year both on and off campus with monthly walks summer bbq Christmas party organised volunteering events and for the sporty types some sponsored runs.   DBS offers great benefits to staff including 24 days annual leave 2 company days 2 days volunteering leave Taxsaver and Bike to Work schemes FREE courses at DBS and reduced fees for family members to name a few.,0.00020366914,0.00034151145,0.9994548
There are no cons to working at DBS from my personal experience. However some staff members are disengaged and portray the College and its management in a negative manner.,0.99508166,0.004767367,0.00015094898
The people I worked with day to day were pretty great and supportive.,0.0028227484,0.06064057,0.9365367
Poor incentives for existing staff. No salary increases. No christmas bonuses. Qualified staff generally start on a lower national wage average. Upper management do not listen to staff feedback.  In result the company has high turnover of staff. They inevitably do not hold onto exceptional people because they do not give them any reasons to stay. So there isn't very much room to progress in this company both in terms of salary and future positions. They may offer you a new position with more responsibility for the same wage or a wage increase that is very very small! Its frustrating and disappointing.,0.99911135,0.0007290818,0.0001595394
Great Benefits: Min 24 days annual leave with 2 company days and 2 volunteering days per year. Free Further Education: Any course you want to take part on Diplomas Degrees or Masters are 100% free; there is also a discount for family members who want to undertake a course in DBS. There have been so many changes in DBS in the past 12 months or so and it has been for the better in my opinion a lot of which is down to the Executive Dean. The Management team are very open to new ideas the communication has improved tenfold and staff turnover in the faculty in particular is very low which speaks volumes. DBS recently won the Education Awards 2017 for Best Student Experience and Best Library team which is testament to just some of the hard work being done in the College. Staff are very down to earth and approachable as are management very nice atmosphere and very friendly culture due to small teams there is a lot of autonomy and experience that you wouldn’t get in another college also none of this clocking in/out on a system which is great and promotes trust. It's great to be part of such a cutting edge third level institution DBS have made great progress it’s just a pity that some people always feel the need to pull the place down but some people are just never happy...!,0.002214125,0.0031418053,0.99464405

Where does one start? Staff turnover at an all time high. No one cares. More interested in why people on full time contracts are not at their desk 95pm.

A lot of students couldn't care less about class and didn't turn up until one or two classes before term finished by which time they had failed the term. Even if they failed the repeat assignment many were still allowed into the following year. I found it hard to engage with the students and keep making the course as interesting after that. No security in the work from term to term hours and times changed and you didn't know if you would be taken on the following year.,0.9981311,0.0016914965,0.0001774663

Lacking research group activity. Main focus on retaining funding and reviews with little thought put into real research agendas. No recognition of achievements. No possibility to advance  there are 3 levels of research career framework and to go from one to the next there appears to be a block stopping researchers move from one level to the next.

I really enjoyed my time working at Dublin City University. I worked there for 1.5 years and while it wasn't the most exciting research project my supervisor was approachable and available. The staff are friendly and your peers typically work to have lunch together at the same time and typically your own office space which can be a positive.,0.00039316269,0.002132176,0.9974746
The pay isn't that great and the monthly pay is annoying at times. Also I feel like there is such an emphasis on awards and getting as much research published as possible just to keep upper management happy (i.e. Brian MacCraith). The lecturers and staff seem unnecessarily stressed out.,0.9983724,0.0014400958,0.00018759567
DCU's famous sense of enterprise and 'can do' makes it a brilliant university to work in  the best I have worked at in my 20year career in universities.

Lack of resources. Some people have a public sector sense of entitlement. The president runs the risk of over promising and under delivering. There is no internal focus on the delivery of everything he is setting out to achieve. Over the last number of years salaries have gone way down as have resources.,0.999084,0.0007540132,0.00016192408

" Just like in most places managers are untouchable. They also have more priviledges than just workers that don't have the magic word ""manager"" "" or ""head of"" next to their title.  The HR is a joke. The head is not a nice person often very rude and dismissive zero emphaty. I know of people who mentioned their mental health and have been looked down on from the HR as if they were idiots.  No benefits other than the government benefits. Forget about anything on Christmas or any annual bonus to say thank you.  There might be some good managers there but my experience is of a very sneaky manager who has been caught in several lies and does not support the team at all. Just says what they think others want to hear but act differently. Becomes easily defensive and offensive.",0.99732757,0.0024628672,0.00020958588

Dublin office is essentially had the bare minimum equipment  months after starting there was still no manager Every other week somone was being let go or quitting. all they care abour is numbers without context,0.9983535,0.0014409978,0.00020553115

Management says that they are a casual team that is open to change but responds poorly to suggested changes. CEO holds complete power over decisions and does not allow others to disagree.

I worked for 5 long years in the Catering Department. Worst 5 years of my life I never worked in a more toxic environment that this. Management is utterly terrible always blamed me for having a life outside the job for taking holidays or days off. Always accusing me for things I never did. Worked in a covid ward for the last 15 months risking my life everyday and doing 12/13 hours a day never got a thank you or general validation for that but after 15 months of working through the pandemic they came to me with a 67€ voucher for the canteen to “thank me for the hard work during the covid” so my hard work was only worth less than a tenner for them. The 12/13 hours shift I was doing involved making breakfast lunch and tea (menus) for 33 patients BY MYSELF probably not even legal as the Irish law says if you serve more than 15 people you need a second person to help. Always making a mess (maybe on purpose) money wise counting less hours than what people actually worked for. Management is also very racist treating people like they’re stupid. I know colleagues who couldn’t even go to their beloved funeral cause had to be force to work. Sunday is double pay but if you dare calling sick at X point during the week they punish you and take Sunday off you/ or giving you just 2/3 days a week instead of a full week just to show they’re in charge. Also they give the staff from the restaurant and the main kitchen free food but the staff from the pantries have to pay for it doesn’t make sense at all!

Little consideration given for the true amount of time necessary for tasks outside the classroom eg. grading assignments lab manuals etc. but rather a fixed amount of time is paid ie. 1 hour and when this is innevitably not enough time teaching staff are left in the position of either working for free or providing inadequate or incomplete feedback to students.

It can get very monotonous talking to dozens of people everyday with the same pitch. Long days with plenty of walking obviously much tougher when the weather's bad as you'll be working in all conditions.   No formal contract. As soon as you drop off your target you'll be let go. Extremely high turnover rate for the firs couple of weeks. If you've proven yourself to be a decent fundraiser you'll be allowed a little leeway if you fall of your targets once in a while but not very much. While this is a con for the job I didn't mind it too much. It's a charity and I would feel bad not making my wage worth it to the organisation. Plus after 7 months or so I was ready to leave so once I started to fall off my target it was essentially a mutual decision for me to leave.  Naturally you'll have to deal with people who disagree with this style of doortodoor fundraising and payment for fundraisers. To be honest I didn't mind these confrontations too much most of them were harmless enough and running into the odd person who is going to give out to you or about the organisation adds a bit of variety to what can become a very monotonous process.,0.9969773,0.0028448307,0.00017775278

Flexible working hours (choose your own shift start and end times and lunch times within certain limits. E.g. can start anytime that suits you between 8am10am lunch anytime from 12pm2pm and finish and go home anytime between 4pm6pm as long as you do a 7.4 hour shift somewhere between those times). Hybrid (in office and remote working) working model. Good base salaries at all levels with annual raises too. A really good pension that gives me the piece of mind of knowing my family is taken care of if anything should ever happen to me. Every kind of leave available you can think of from sick leave (paid) annual leave parental leave bereavement leave exam leave etc. Very solid HR department with well defined processes and procedures. Management couldn't be more accommodating as long as you give your fair dues they'll always do everything they can to accommodate any needs you might have. Truly Non discriminatory I have colleagues of all races religions genders abilities appearences and socioeconomic backgrounds and promotion in my experience is an absolutely fair competition of skill and experience plenty of the same diversity right up through the ranks to the managing board. Work life balance is exceptional. There's a true acceptance that employees work to enhance their lives not that they live to work and hence it's expected and understood that one's personal and family life should always come first and this is accommodated to an exceptional degree. I'm not usually one to drink the company koolade but since working here my quality of life has soared and it really is difficult to find fault here. And no I'm not upper or even middle management I have been ground level in the company until only a few weeks ago and am now only one level up from the bottom but even so I have always been treated with the utmost dignity and respect and paid well and there is no culture here of walking on the backs of anyone below you or disrespecting anyone no matter how low down the ladder. All of this coupled with the fact that the work you do here will make a genuine difference in the lives of the people who need it most rather than just making even more money for some rich asshat who neither needs or deserves it makes the work you do infinitely more fulfilling and meaningful and means you can really tell yourself at the end of a hard day's work that what you did today really mattered and helped make the world a slightly better place for someone than it was before you started. The self respect and personal meaning that gives is in itself priceless. On top of that there is plenty of room for promotion nearly everyday there are new opportunities advertised internally for people to advance or transfer to different areas of the business to broaden their experience.,0.51673543,0.20715298,0.2761116
Literally none that I can think of. Maybe just the fact that you have to stomach indirectly working for politicians that you might find hard to tolerate on a personal level but this is aided by the fact that you work for the government of Ireland whomever that might be as elected by the people. If the people should choose to elect your preferred political candidates then you have the pleasure of working for them just as much as any other party who is successful at election time. My point is while you work for government you work for any and all Irish governments Pobal is nonpartisan and will work with whomever the people of Ireland democratically elect. I suppose if I was to reaaaaaly nitpick some health insurance would be nice.,0.0026295886,0.99663407,0.0007364138

Middle management spend all day on YouTube. If you have any questions expect to get eye rolls and tuts. New staff would come in excited to start a new role but within a week would learn that they should have taken note of that previous Glassdoor review where the ex employee said that it was the place to go if you’ve given up on a career. Such a high staff turn over and yet nothing is done to improve staff morale. Supervisor will tell new staff not to ask questions despite staff being told when they arrive that the floor supervisor is there for such questions. As time goes on you will begin to realise you are losing knowledge. Very frustrating and depressing place to work. Too many colleagues used to go home and cry to their partners because they took this job. You won’t stay here long so you are better off not taking the job and that way your cv won’t have evidence of a short stint. I stayed there too long and too many times thought about leaving before I had another job lined up. Your mental health will suffer working here. HR don’t care about employees even if they like to say they do in the responses they have to negative reviews on Glassdoor.,0.9982374,0.0015584902,0.00020405116

Where do I start. Most of their IT support is provided by a managed service provider who is completely understaffed and not capable of supporting the roughly 4000 students and 1500 staff members. This service provider assigned 2 people to handle the calls for all these users which is laughable. So nobody called the helpdesk they just came to the IT building and demanded to be helped this caused a lot of stress as people were queuing out the door.  It seemed like there was no actual proper leadership in the department and some very big decisions were made without much consideration which caused complete chaos.  It seemed like many of the high ups were completely out of touch with what was happening on ground level and didn't seem to care much as long as they weren't affected and don't think about asking for help or advise or you will be treated as if you're incompetent scum of the earth.

Many people seem to be quite ambitious (especially researching Professors).  PhD students have flexible working times.  PhD students and undergraduates can participate in various sport and social activities.  Most colleagues are usually nice.,0.003558531,0.93188584,0.06455566
Many people are very selffocussed. (Maybe that's totally normal in science  in order to progress you have to look at yourself first. Or maybe it is just normal for PhD students because that'll make you finish sooner.)  Many supervisors seem to be overambitious. They rather get projects started fast and in the way they want  rather than listening to others (including their own PhD students or anybody who is working with these techniques a major part of their time) trying to understand their points and then deciding together for the best solution.  Publish or Perish seems to be written in capitals for many people here.  PhD students are the cheapest workers and have to do things for which technicians should actually be employed. If you'd tell somebody in industry what activities you use someone with a first degree for they would be in tears  either from laughing or from crying or both.  PhD students get a salary that is appalling compared to the fact that these people have a finished degree already. Oh and compared to cost of living in this city as well.  Supervisors mistake summer students as helpful for PhD students. Unskilled workers in a work that requires skill and experience are NOT helpful! And they should neither be given their own projects and (useful or even correct) results expected nor should they be assigned to individual PhD students  who only loose time and nerves with training these from scratch. Summer students should walk around with technicians and give them a hand. They must be seen as mediumterm investment (when they might come back) but not as short term help  because they are no help!  Some of the rooms that PhD students are sitting in for the majority of their work time are actually dreadful and will not spark ideas nor allow concentrated efficient working.  Most 3rd and 4th year PhDs have only one wish: leave as soon as possible (= once handed in). Many have mentally quitted their job already. Many retract to the barely necessary things to fulfil their own job  but absolutely nothing else beside it that would cause more unpleasant work or could cause any elongation of their time there. This makes it hard to collaborate with many experienced people.  Trying to change something / anything may cause resistance / ignorance from others and not get appreciated or positively valued at all. One might loose all motivation to change even the smallest thing if it's doomed to be received negatively in most cases. Many people take up a nihilistic style and define any problem as somebody else's problem / responsibility (including even telling these people because that is already somebody else's problem).,0.9984326,0.0014191419,0.00014829842

The College admin is incredibly obscure slow and openly unfair (if not corrupt). Executives are mainly people who spend all their professional life in the same institution and are promoted on the mere grounds of their internal seniority and their personal ties to top managers and in particular the Provost (especially if a provost has a dictatorial attitude). Career progress is very slow and unpredictable. HR is one of the worst departments in the whole university: the promotion applications they handle are pedantic unpredictable very time consuming and very unfair (you might need to wait a decade before having chances to be promoted for the first time). There is a culture of nepotism especially in the social sciences which is very difficult or impossible to eradicate.,0.99904317,0.0007984219,0.00015840212

The research group has an excessive workload that requires employees to work overtime and weekends. The highpressure work environment is characterized by continuous criticism of performance unreasonable deadlines and an expectation to work more than 6070 hours per week. This overworking culture negatively impacts the wellbeing and productivity of researchers in the group.

As a student research assistant I had the opportunity to work with an academic with whom I shared interests and got along well and this made the job very enjoyable and beneficial.  I felt like I was a valued partner to my boss rather than a resource to be employed for his benefit alone.  However I imagine this could vary greatly between academics.  Aside from this individual aspect of my job the great benefits were the flexibility working remotely and at my own pace were encouraged and the pay other comparable jobs/internships are regularly unpaid.  These were major advantages for me and meant that I could earn money and maintain a fantastic quality of life while in this position.,0.000691158,0.0015317488,0.99777704
While there were many good aspects to this position the actual daily work I was engaged in was very monotonous.  I was essentially doing data entry for the duration of the employment and while this was pleasantly stress free it meant that I wasn't challenged or didn't progress my skills in any meaningful way.  However to his credit my boss was aware of this and tried to involve me in the project he was working on in other ways as much as was possible.    This wasn't an issue for me but working closely with one single academic has the potential to be hit and miss.  A personality clash could sour the whole experience.,0.44546494,0.5535774,0.00095766335

The hierarchical structure of this place is unbelievable. Incompetent and authoritarian senior managers that have no touch with reality. Communication between departments is dreadful. Human Resources is particularly bad for those working there as well as those who need to deal with it. Workload is not manageable and worklife balance doesnt exist in some departments. Grading system is often unfair with those in the mid/lower grades often working harder than everybody else (really useless and incompetent Senior Management). Promotion process is a joke.  High turnover. laming and bullying culture and many people out sick due to stress and poor mental health  management doesnt care and doesnt address these issues.,0.9991372,0.0007041788,0.00015859661

Terribly stressful place to work if you are an administrator. Systems were poorlyorganised and inefficient. Pay was poor and morale very low. Many longserving staff members are aggressive and unpleasant to deal with. Staff are micromanaged overworked and treated as disposable. Career progression for administrators is difficult with many staff I worked with getting stuck in roles for years with no progression and staff vastly overqualified for the positions they held. HR did not really provide training or upskilling for administrators. I work at another third level institution in Dublin now and the difference in work environment is amazing. I would never return to TCD.,0.99847275,0.0012712171,0.0002560401
The location is very handy. Although on short term contracts but once you get in there will always be (short term) positions. Once you've worked there for more than 3 or 4 years (dont remember exactly) you will get a permanent contract from the college. This means that as long as there is an role matching your background in college they will have to give it to you.,0.002504513,0.30414143,0.69335407
The length of contract highly depends on the length of projects and therefore postdoc researchers always need to worry about their next contract. But this is part of the academic life if you decide to take an academic career. Trinity is not so famous for its science and engineering so if  it is not a good place to do research in these disciplines.,0.99876,0.0011060183,0.0001340407

Some buildings (such as mine) are in pretty terrible shape; impossible to secure longterm contracts at early career stages and worklife balance can be a struggle (as almost everywhere else to be fair); given the terribly high cost of rent in town even the highest salaries might not be enough especially if one has a family; quality of the canteen should be improved given the cost of the meals.,0.9990061,0.00084091653,0.00015301423

Much of the paperwork that you would expect administrators to do lands on the academic's desk.  For contract staff and hourly paid staff money is not really one of the main selling points.

Projects are small (research prestartup type of work usually less then five people) so there's a wide range of stuff to tackle and be exposed to.   There's often enormous freedom in choosing work topics times tools and approaches.  The objective is to get the job done right not bill for hours spent or to get something shipped and you can often publish your work publicly.  If you are fortunate and your PI or supervisor is good it can be very intellectually rewarding or financially (Havok Iona and others all spun out of TCD).,0.013568159,0.9293867,0.057045154
There aren't many good PIs or supervisors. And a bad one will lead to a lot of mental stress from very poor management skills technical skills even basic people skills.  Contracts are usually for less than two years and job security or prospects for academic careers are currently nonexistant and that's unlikely to change in the coming decade thanks to government policy budget cuts and basic maths (tenure track posts are few and oversubscribed by several orders of magnitude).   Things you would normally take as granted as being banned by HR are rife. Work/life balance is nonexistant and it is expected that you will accept this.   Pay is lower than the private sector to start; if you're doing a PhD you're on a stipend of less than €15k per annum and may not earn more than that or you lose the stipend. If you're on contract your pay is docked by public sector pay levies and pension levies even though you have no job security which is the usual compensation for those levies.   If you are expecting equity deals or the like for a spinout you need to get that in writing well ahead of time. College policy will not back contract employees over staff in the event of dispute.   The mental paradigm of PhD students being serfs to academics and the newer paradigm of contract researchers being vassals of the department are both rife amongst some sectors of the college though a good PI or supervisor will not subscribe to those paradigms. Hopefully.  Internecine politics is rife at all organisational levels from the board on down to individual academics and in a wide range of severities.,0.99854386,0.0012920619,0.00016409376

•	Nice relaxing and flexible work environment not really stressful the people you meet and the moments you spend with them inside or outside Tyndall are amazing.  •	Suitable only for shortterm contracts with a maximum duration of 1 to 1.5 years like doing a master’s internship or research assistant. See it only as a very small step of your career’s path. See below why.,0.00023861925,0.000512885,0.99924845
•	Very low salaries compared to industry. The majority of the researchers students (postdoc or assistant) and engineers are getting very low salaries and given the conditions of high cost of life in Cork city and Ireland it is very difficult to live. Good money in Tyndall goes only to toplevel managers.  •	Many of the P.I.’s (Principal Investigators Tyndall’s toplevel team of managers who mainly lead the research within each group) care mostly about the number of projects they undertake from industry or research foundations in order to maximize their profit and not the successful outcome of those. For that reason they always tend to focus on doing new proposals and to hire more and more students/researchers but they fail at the most important point managing and supervising those correctly. Consequently most of the projects fail and there is no strong research outcome. They also spend most of their time outofoffice for one million reasons (like endless everyday meetings) not being available to supervise researchers or to move their group’s work forward. Staff come and then quickly realise this logic and lack of organisation and soon quit.  •	Due to the lack of organization mentioned above students are often forced to finalize their theses and the last stages of their degrees when being in parallel in the next stage of their career for example when they have taken a role in industry outside which makes time very limited to manage everything.  •	A lot of time is being lost in organizing showcase events of “who are we what we do what we will do”. Too much “bla bla” but not real work behind. They are mostly advertising and promoting their projects and their work rather than doing and finishing it properly. In many cases though industry from the outside world knows the hard reality.  •	In many groups wrong people are placed at key job positions.   •	Bullying behaviours have been reported at some groups from people who manage others.  •	There is no clear career path for a permanent job position. Apart from the few toplevel managers team and supporting officers who mainly hold the permanent job positions there is no opportunity of getting a permanent job position in research. For instance UCC (University College Cork) which is the organisation behind Tyndall for the majority of research positions has 10 points of postdoc job positions the first 7 nonsenior and the final 3 senior where each point is one year of experience after PhD. As a result it may take 10 years to see if you can take a permanent job position like research fellow or research lead.  •	Low allowance for holidays (paid annual leave) apart students. Only 19 days to take off per year and another 4 during the Christmas to New Year’s Day period which is a standard closure. No other dayoff allowances. However some group managers are often flexible with that some others are unjustifiably strict even for a single day you take.  •	Poor maintenance cleanliness and organisation for many of the labs. You can easily get lost in old and abandoned equipment broken wires dirtiness and whatever you can imagine.  •	No benefits (apart from a free car parking slot after being staff member for 3 consecutive years) no salary bonuses and the most important no health insurance.,0.9985511,0.0012767934,0.00017207387

UCC very much benefits from hiring people who have significant corporate experience but want a better worklife balance at low salaries (primarily female). However unfortunately the expectation for professional staff is to be always on and the level of stress is the same. They notoriously under hire professional staff to save money while spending huge sums of money on lecturers who teach two or three times a week. Poor management training combined with extremely limited promotion opportunities make them a horrible place to work. They have offered promotions for admin staff twice in ten years  and in the last promotion round for EA to SEA there were 6 promotions available across the thousands of UCC staff.

Slow and lots of red tape. Different departments and offices are siloed resulting in many processes being inefficient and only serve that silo instead of supporting the bigger picture...making the unveristy more effective. If you are used to a fast work environment where productive change and efficiency are important to you you will be frustrated and likely unhappy here. That said there are exceptions with some departments which work very effectively and would be good to work for where they do not rely on the actions of other internal departments or deal with external stakeholders only.,0.9798718,0.019765235,0.0003628713

Low pay.   Almost everyone who does a PhD realizes they don't really enjoy writing and there is alot of writing associated with publishing papers and writing a thesis.  If you are not academically inclined you may struggle to publish papers or complete your thesis in time this happens a lot of people.    There is a risk you end up doing a PhD in an area you dislike.   You must be selfmotivated and capable of working without a boss breathing down your neck this is generally a good thing but some people do need the pressure of 'that boss'.   Most PhD students end up with laidback supervisors and so it is your responsibility to show up on time get your work done publish papers and write a thesis for some people this is a good thing for others  they can struggle with the responsibility.,0.78823704,0.2099031,0.0018598207

Paid way too little. This was schoolspecific but very little support for PhD students. Very few organised meetings for all PhD students (to meet each other and get that community/support) PhDs treated like dirt not even considered employees or part of the school. The skills you gain and opportunities you may see/take part in will depend on your supervisor. If your supervisor does not pay attention to these opportunities (collaborations transferable skills courses networking opportunities etc) you will lose out on them. And most importantly many tenured professors treat PhD students as scum. Expected to TA many hours per week for free on top of paying them a nonliving wage.,0.99902153,0.00081456377,0.00016385222

UCD is a great university and produces some really high quality research output. The research body is numerous broad and very friendly. There are many large research groups across a wide range of subject areas and the university encourages publication and conference travel. The university has some decent industry ties through NovaUCD. This is a comfortable place to work.,0.00020492023,0.00024450634,0.9995505
The main problem with UCD is that it is public sector run. For permanent staff this is great  pension payscales no chance of ever being fired! But for contract researchers it can be a bit of a knightmare. Recently the uni brought in the Research Careers Framework to address the fixed term workers act and relabel post docing as a training role. Once your training/4 years is up  you are out. Problem is there is no where to go... no permanent lecturing positions very hard route to research fellow and not allowed stay on as PD. Only option is to go abroad or go to industry. Now this is a major issue becasue PD's run most of the labs on a daytoday so there is a major brain drain on the university and all they care about is there budget. I think the effect of this brain drain on teaching practicals master courses and research outputs can already be seen.,0.9988972,0.0009419932,0.00016070734

 Worst communication imaginable: Had to jump through multiple hoops for a period of almost 3 weeks to get a simple 20 word response.   No contract: Didn't receive a contract specifying hours pay or any other details for the entire period of employment. By law supposed to receive one 1 month after beginning work.  Didn't get paid Having left the country by the time I was supposed to be paid and having no idea on how to claim and for a number of reasons it turned out too difficult to actually get the money. One employee at the university did offer to try and find a way to get the undisclosed amount to me but by that time I was already sick and tired of the back and forth emails so just requested that the money be donated to the student union (at the time of writing I have received no confirmation of whether this has been done). Important to note that previously mentioned employee did seem very keen to help. However after over a month of back and forth emails with multiple people at the university it seemed like it was becoming a waste of time.,0.9987244,0.0011259677,0.00014968042
Steady secure employment if you get Tenure. Teaching loads not as high as most other Irish Universities. Freedom of Expression in Research pretty good if you don't worry about Promotion. Stress is low if you don't worry about trying to change things (which is impossible anyway  see below).,0.018474413,0.8589818,0.12254374
Promotion prospects for NonIrish are dismal (e.g. nobody I have spoken to has ever heard of an American being promoted to Professor and I can find none on record). Salary for junior ranks is low. Management is entirely 'TopDown' and seems to be based almost entirely on financial concerns. Little or no employee input into operations. Almost entirely nonsocial (very little 'collegiality') since abolition of Departments (arguably to ensure this) a decade ago. No potential for extra salary or reduced teaching even for very large research grants.,0.9989926,0.0008653136,0.00014203042

The job environment has no cons the real problems come at the end of the day.  Accomodations in Dublin are terrible: cold poor plumbing poor electric systems and all these hold true for newly built homes too: it's just the Irish way; Irish food culture is also terrible: avoid canteens and restaurants bring lunch from home.,0.99891627,0.00094171916,0.00014201361

neoliberal university system  PhDs/Masters get paid very little and are expected to take on huge teaching and external research workloads to get ahead.

There is an opportunity for them to cover your additional study costs (e..g to do a masters degree) and lots of HR workshops  The campus is incredible (assuming remote working stops and you actually get to work from there) nice coffee shops and great spaces to go for walks.  If you're permanent in the public sector it is obviously very robost and secure (though lots of short contracts and people getting screwed because of CID entitlements) Lots of events and things to attend Gym on site is crowded af but still has good classes options Vibrant campus and plenty of people to make friends with Kerstin is a president to be proud of the first female president of any Irish HEIs and a kind smart inspirational woman. Of course she's not perfect who is but she's definitely a sincere woman with integrity. Which is a very welcome change from the previous person. Limerick is very affordable to live in comparison to other places in Ireland and has a great vibe to it I think the students really get a great experience studying there it is something to be proud of contributing to adds a sense of purpose that's nice to any job in the place. Education can be transformative and you can be a positive part of that. Free counselling 6 sessions a year very usefull recommend everyone use them,0.0003871357,0.0005423205,0.9990706
My unit was chronically overworked and shortstaffed. Other units had way more staff and people on the same grade or higher were literally doing 50% of the workload. Constantly was expected to work beyond capacity management knew I was working nights and weekends but never intervened. When I'd finally collapse and become sick from overworking id have to take time off but Id come back to so much work built up it was often not worth taking time off because they didn't have enough staff to do the job even when we were all in so if someone was out sick there was no way you could cover them.  When Des was the president the place lost all sense of community and became toxic from the top down. It was run like North Korea he was a bully and dictator and that approach flowed downstream It has had many scandals in terms of its handling of finances and whistleblowers The housing department were the only uni in Ireland to refuse to refund students rent at the start of the pandemic (and previously were trying to squeeze two students into onebedroom rooms  it was all a bit disgusting and made you a bit ashamed to work there. Though I don't think the university is fundamentally mismanaged or sinister anymore (though the housing unit definitely still is takes away from the overall reputation.  The logo rebrand was managed disgracefully and the end result was an embarassment. Again on Des's watch. Can be like a small town with lots of rumours and gossip and nosey people. Worse than a high school. Some people are so happy to repeat completely unverified stuff about colleagues personal lives without care for the damage such rumours can have. You need to be very careful who you tell what to.  Communication to staff internally is terrible even since they finally hired an internal comms person he must not be too busy lol  but it is much better than in Des's time Working in a poorly resourced sections make your job harder through unsustainable workload  but seeing other over resourced lazy sections is mentally hard to take,0.9987903,0.0010516506,0.00015802725

Anything I have to say about UL as an employer is going to be a pretty specific experience and maybe not generally applicable.  I was starting a PhD and worked as a TA and a Lecturer.  Teaching is great.  My colleagues were good people.  I love academia and I loved being at UL.,0.007886504,0.6504766,0.34163696
As a temporary employee the amount of hours I could get was limited and therefore my overall remuneration was also limited.  This was partially due to being the lowest man on the totem pole.  Being a postgrad student and trying to make ends meet is tough in any case.,0.99907506,0.0007906078,0.00013429618
UL is easily the best college campus in Ireland and arguably one of the best in Europe. The quality of its staff is excellent and their attitude and dedication to the student body is outstanding. The atmosphere on the campus is very good and this fosters a better level of communication between teaching staff and students in my opinion.  There is a decent variety of places to eat.  The college is continuously expanding and so the potential is huge.,0.00030608627,0.0005215087,0.99917245
Staff are treated with borderline disdain  career progression is virtually unheard of unless no suitable applicants can be found and the management team's hand is forced.  There is a huge emphasis placed on teaching hours and commitment and this undoubtedly stifles research and development. As a PhD student I was forced to teach for at least 68 hours every week notwithstanding preparation time grading etc which drastically cut into my research and led to me essentially resenting my role as an educator.   Very little work life balance for staff on all levels. Too much is asked of the majority of staff which isn't reflected in pay or opportunities.,0.99912506,0.00071738,0.00015758772

Bureaucratic at times but I would imagine no more so than any other Irish university. Promotion opportunities somewhat limited and probably not worth the effort (lots of publishing teaching excellence awards etc) for a relatively small salary increase.

The Politics Department at University of Limerick is an excellent place to work.

Really poor set salary with no scale or increment policy for those who are looking to progress in their time at the organisation. High staff turnover due to poorly qualified and tokenistic management structures.  Say all the right things but deliver little to fulltime employees. One particular director is invisible in the organisation and serves little in assisting in the smooth relations in the organisation. Senior management are afraid of change and staff members regularly report and suggest more efficient work processes which are then inevitably turned down and eventually employed years down the line. No trust in the skill sets qualifications and experience of team members to effect positive change presumably running the risk of compromising their own competence in senior management. Some support services staff are overly qualified and have very specific role responsibilities yet treated as PA's to some management.,0.99883074,0.0010144772,0.0001548346
