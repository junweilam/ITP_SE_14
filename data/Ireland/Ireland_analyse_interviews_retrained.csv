The application form is outdated and in MS Word format. Waited a long time to get any confirmation and then very short notice about the interview date. The external person on the panel was not an academic and couldn't ask reasonable questions about research.

The interview itself was fine and professionally conducted.  However the overall process was very poor and they did not keep to their own timelines around communications at any point in the process.  There was a 2 month gap between the job application deadline and a phone call from HR to inform me I was shortlisted for an interview.   At the end of the interview I was told by the HR panelist that they would make a decision within two weeks and asked me twice to confirm my referees' availability. I was told they wanted someone to start straight away which I could.  But they never reached out to my referees nor did they have the courtesy to let me know if they made a decision or not.   It has been two months since my interview for this senior level role within the university network so this lack of communication is a serious flag.  It is quite disappointing as the project was very interesting and I supported it's social objective.   I'd suggest Glassdoor widens their options for the 'Did you get an offer' question. Not getting an offer could mean  you were formally rejected or just got ghosted and never heard back. I think this is an important metric for candidates.,0.99333465,0.0061748466,0.00049047335

Panel of six one external asked scholarly (but not well informed) questions the other seemed to think she was the 'bad cop' in a 'good cop bad cop' scenario. Actually she didn't know really what she was talking about but that didn't stop her being unpleasant in a manic fashion. Otherwise questions seemed a bit oblique and I'm not sure they didn't have a candidate already in mind. Bit surprised I was asked to go at all given this institution (the 'entrepreneurial' university of Ireland) had employed my business partner on a temporary contract and had made some arrangement with him to become independent of the partnership and carry out the business wit them in their facility.

The interview process is comprehensive. Experience and qualifications of candidates does not matter. The interview procedure has something wrong in selecting individuals. Sometimes  people feel candidates are preselected already.  Some questions are given to the staff and some others do not even know what would be ask. Managers give answers to candidates so there is a huge room for biases.  Candidates need to answer specific examples not just concepts.,0.9981772,0.0016632983,0.00015960318

3 people interviewing a question each in which they grade. Extremely structured too structured all too 'academic' at times. The room had windows though none were open the room was like a sauna so exceptionally difficult to sit in a suit and tie throughout.  The first question was to define understanding of the term 'talent pipeline' which was typically college; it seemed strange to define a term rather than being asked to explain a process. I just don't understand how the ability to define a word makes you a stronger candidate.  I acquired feedback and I thought the marking was unfair at times. The details they gave and described as 'extremely difficult' when dealing with '8 stakeholders'  to an experienced recruiter who may deal with 50 clients at a time this is a walk in the park. They didn't really buy into any commercial awareness or a commercially savvy response to a situation or innovation. I think it's set out to find a particular type person  from my own experience I think they underestimate the important of character drive and actual performance.   Overall I found all details in the interview very straight forward. There were elements that I've encountered as the basics of my current role for the past 5 years. Though the marks received totally contradicted this. Though I'm unsure of how they mark it and the criteria it falls under. I felt it was marked more as an exam than an opinion of somebodies capability to excel in a role.,0.99545777,0.004383558,0.00015865976

Following application online received an email informing me of interview date and time. The interview itself was a 30 minute competency based interview. Following the interview was informed of the outcome by the HR recruiter.   The interview itself was ok but I felt the internal recruiter was so impersonal.

"Interview took place on campus and lasted 25 minutes. There were three interviewers I was not informed who they would be in advance. I was expected to give a 35 minute presentation about the department I was applying for at the start. This was followed by a very traditional interview with competency based questions (""Tell me about a time when..."" etc). Most negative aspect was that they took over a month to make a decision. The time from initial application to final decision was two months.",0.99880624,0.0010477175,0.00014605821
 Application online.  Notification of interview 2.5 weeks later. 9 days notice of onsite interview.   Interview panel released the day before the interview not all listed were present at interview  no reference at interview to the absent panel member.  Timeline for notification of outcome at interview was 1 week no notification of outcome received for 2.5 weeks following request for update.  Delayed start to interview shorter interview than outlined in advance.  Discussed some aspects of the job description with requests for examples discussed motivation for application and for seeking a new position.   Each panel member had a list of questions questions sometimes repeated.   Very little time allocated to discussing the role or followup questions by candidate.  No evidence of familiarity with candidate CV or application. Not a very modern approach to interviewing  poor understanding of private sector experiences/examples.  Interviewers seemed to take a very traditional approach to questions and from their attitudes seemed to be firmly steeped in a civil service/ higher education sector approach.   Very poor candidate experience interviewers seemed reluctant to engage or build rapport.,0.9987287,0.0011531969,0.00011807863

The interview was intimidating even for someone very experienced like myself. The reason it was this way is because i was left waiting in a hallway for over 40 minutes  the only contact anybody made with me were some friendly folks passing by.   When i was finally called for my presentation and interview  i immediately felt like i wasn't welcome. I was rushed through everything only one person on the panel seemed friendly and the others seemed like they were going through the motions. Somebody even mentioned that they were running into their lunchtime  message received.  The most unfair and upsetting element of this process was that my interview took 30 minutes  longer than i was sitting outside and clearly longer than the candidate before me.   My presentation was great and i was well prepared I have years of experience that i was not asked about clearly because the interviewers were hungry.   I am not easily stressed by interviews.... this was a truly awful experience  I would never raise this directly with the university because i could never apply for a job there again if i went on record about this unprofessional interview.

Absolute joke on an interview. Flew 6000 miles to deliver a 20 min lecture to interview panel on subject that was preselected and not my subject area. Then a half an hour interview. Was in town several days. No tour of campus. No meal. No meet and greet. Just one hour of contact. Never even saw the department. Interviews had empty lunch plates and waste strewn across their table and one fell asleep. Only half my expenses reimbursed and even they were several months late. Felt very disrespected.
