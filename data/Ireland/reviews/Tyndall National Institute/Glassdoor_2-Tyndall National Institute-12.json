See it only as a very small step of your career\u2019s path. See below why.", "cons": "\u2022\tVery low salaries compared to industry. The majority of the researchers, students (postdoc or assistant) and engineers are getting very low salaries and, given the conditions of high cost of life in Cork city and Ireland, it is very difficult to live. Good money in Tyndall goes only to top-level managers.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMany of the P.I.\u2019s (Principal Investigators, Tyndall\u2019s top-level team of managers who mainly lead the research within each group) care mostly about the number of projects they undertake from industry or research foundations in order to maximize their profit, and not the successful outcome of those. For that reason, they always tend to focus on doing new proposals and to hire more and more students/researchers, but they fail at the most important point, managing and supervising those correctly. Consequently, most of the projects fail, and there is no strong research outcome. They also spend most of their time out-of-office for one million reasons (like endless everyday meetings), not being available to supervise researchers or to move their group\u2019s work forward. Staff come and then quickly realise this logic and lack of organisation and soon quit.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDue to the lack of organization mentioned above, students are often forced to finalize their theses and the last stages of their degrees when being in parallel in the next stage of their career, for example when they have taken a role in industry outside, which makes time very limited to manage everything.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tA lot of time is being lost in organizing showcase events of \u201cwho are we, what we do, what we will do\u201d. Too much \u201cbla bla\u201d but not real work behind. They are mostly advertising and promoting their projects and their work, rather than doing and finishing it properly. In many cases though, industry from the outside world knows the hard reality.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIn many groups wrong people are placed at key job positions. \r\n\r\n\u2022\tBullying behaviours have been reported at some groups from people who manage others.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThere is no clear career path for a permanent job position. Apart from the few top-level managers team and supporting officers who mainly hold the permanent job positions, there is no opportunity of getting a permanent job position in research. For instance, UCC (University College Cork) which is the organisation behind Tyndall for the majority of research positions, has 10 points of postdoc job positions, the first 7 non-senior and the final 3 senior, where each point is one year of experience after PhD. As a result, it may take 10 years to see if you can take a permanent job position like research fellow, or research lead.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tLow allowance for holidays (paid annual leave), apart students. Only 19 days to take off per year and another 4 during the Christmas to New Year\u2019s Day period, which is a standard closure. No other day-off allowances. However, some group managers are often flexible with that, some others are unjustifiably strict even for a single day you take.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPoor maintenance, cleanliness and organisation for many of the labs. You can easily get lost in old and abandoned equipment, broken wires, dirtiness and whatever you can imagine.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tNo benefits (apart from a free car parking slot after being staff member for 3 consecutive years), no salary bonuses, and the most important, no health insurance."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Generally good!", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Researcher in Cork", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Loads of opportunities to get experience\r\nExciting research projects", "cons": "Low annual leave\r\nBureaucracy can slow things down tremendously"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "General review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Project Manager in Cork", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good environment for critical thinking and analytical skills, training options available mainly with the UCC, good for Academics, and currently expanding operations.", "cons": "Financial risks are funding/project depending, few career paths available to grow, poor communications and minimal induction processes, bureaucratic and slow for all functions."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Researcher", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Researcher in Cork", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "One of the best employer friendly organization,. \r\nGood HR setup.", "cons": "As the city is bit costly to live, the salary might not be adequate."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Tyndall", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Electronics Design Engineer in Cork", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No pressure of a big company", "cons": "Selfish Management.
