[[{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best employer I've ever had", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Systems Administrator in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working hours (choose your own shift start and end times and lunch times within certain limits. E.g. can start anytime that suits you between 8am-10am, lunch anytime from 12pm-2pm and finish and go home anytime between 4pm-6pm as long as you do a 7.4 hour shift somewhere between those times). Hybrid (in office and remote working) working model. Good base salaries at all levels with annual raises too. A really good pension that gives me the piece of mind of knowing my family is taken care of if anything should ever happen to me. Every kind of leave available you can think of from sick leave (paid), annual leave, parental leave, bereavement leave, exam leave, etc. Very solid HR department with well defined processes and procedures. Management couldn't be more accommodating, as long as you give your fair dues they'll always do everything they can to accommodate any needs you might have. Truly Non discriminatory, I have colleagues of all races, religions, genders, abilities, appearences and socio-economic backgrounds and promotion in my experience is an absolutely fair competition of skill and experience, plenty of the same diversity right up through the ranks to the managing board. Work life balance is exceptional. There's a true acceptance that employees work to enhance their lives, not that they live to work, and hence it's expected and understood that one's personal and family life should always come first and this is accommodated to an exceptional degree. I'm not usually one to drink the company koolade but since working here my quality of life has soared and it really is difficult to find fault here. And no I'm not upper or even middle management, I have been ground level in the company until only a few weeks ago and am now only one level up from the bottom but even so I have always been treated with the utmost dignity and respect and paid well and there is no culture here of walking on the backs of anyone below you or disrespecting anyone no matter how low down the ladder. All of this coupled with the fact that the work you do here will make a genuine difference in the lives of the people who need it most rather than just making even more money for some rich asshat who neither needs or deserves it makes the work you do infinitely more fulfilling and meaningful and means you can really tell yourself at the end of a hard day's work that what you did today really mattered and helped make the world a slightly better place for someone than it was before you started. The self respect and personal meaning that gives is in itself priceless. On top of that there is plenty of room for promotion, nearly everyday there are new opportunities advertised internally for people to advance or transfer to different areas of the business to broaden their experience.", "cons": "Literally none that I can think of. Maybe just the fact that you have to stomach indirectly working for politicians that you might find hard to tolerate on a personal level but this is aided by the fact that you work for the government of Ireland, whomever that might be, as elected by the people. If the people should choose to elect your preferred political candidates then you have the pleasure of working for them just as much as any other party who is successful at election time. My point is while you work for government, you work for any and all Irish governments, Pobal is non-partisan and will work with whomever the people of Ireland democratically elect. I suppose if I was to reaaaaaly nitpick some health insurance would be nice."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Overall good experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Test Coordinator in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible and sometime it is hectic", "cons": "strict PayScale, slow growth ,"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Undervalued.
