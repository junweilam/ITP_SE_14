Just good people who are bad at running a business.", "cons": "- No direction. Nobody knows what they are supposed to do, including the full-time employees who openly ask this on a regular basis. The office is full of interns, and the only person who knows about trade came to the office once every 2-3 weeks.\n- Insane levels of bureaucracy. Nothing is done unless it is approved in Boston, Washington D,C. and ten other stages of management.\n- In Dublin, very few people in the business community even know who WTC Dublin are, despite it being around for over 10 years. When I heard \"World Trade Center\" I was expecting to work in a modern building full of the latest technology - instead I found myself in a dingy office with old-style computers and outdated business methods."}]]
