CEO holds complete power over decisions and does not allow others to disagree. Gossip and pettiness are commonplace. Marketing mix is heavily weighted towards traditional marketing with no evidence that this is working. Digital marketing is given less than 5% of marketing budget. The CEO takes a 6 figure salary, even though the annual funds raised are less than 2 million."}], []]
