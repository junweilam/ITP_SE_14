This is one of the most toxic and unprofessional places I have worked in. Like someone stated, if you are currently interviewing with the company or have a formal offer, please reconsider. If you are a person of colour, avoid this place. Opportunities for people of colour is limited despite the noise they make about equality and diversity. I got employed there during the lock down and working remotely, didn\u2019t get to experience their toxicity. With the lifting of COVID restrictions and a return to the office I got to witness everything. What I thought was a professional setting turned out to be a place rife with gossip, jealousy, bullying, and pettiness. There is this emphasis on making friends which is about the only criteria you need to get a promotion or other opportunities. It\u2019s not uncommon to frequently overhear hushed gossiping about someone or acts to undermine someone because that person doesn\u2019t move the way the group wants, or the person got recognized by a superior. Pretty much like a high school. During a meeting where I was talking, I once caught a senior colleague making gestures at me to another when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. It\u2019s not uncommon to have a manager who really doesn\u2019t know what he/she is doing and will try to cover up their inefficiencies by throwing those they are supervising under the bus. The culture at Concern is one of the worst with some of the most disturbing and unprofessional behaviour I have ever seen. For the clueless HR department, an equally toxic unit, the solution to this is to organize periodic meetups where everyone is literally forced to sit through 30-minute meet-ups, where everyone pretends to be friends, have coffee and make small talk. Afterwards the organizers go back and congratulate themselves saying how the meetings are going on well. Of course, nothing changes because changing a toxic culture is deeper than just meet ups where you paste your fake smiles and engage in idle conversations ."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "23 May 2023", "job_title": "Sales Representative in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "4 or 5 day week", "cons": "Travelling a lot around the country"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Charitable sector, not so charitable", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Advisor in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "great colleagues, good values, important work!", "cons": "limited options for remote work, limited pay progression, very top-down management for the charity sector"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Ok", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "25 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Accountant in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good mission and values with the org", "cons": "Communication from Management can be bad"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good experience", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Telemarketer in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexi work Good team spirit", "cons": "No progression in role Salary could be better"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "5 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Head of CRM in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great working environment, great team and all alligned to one goal", "cons": "None that i can think of"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Management and HR are running the place to the ground", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good flexible working hours and less pressured environment.
