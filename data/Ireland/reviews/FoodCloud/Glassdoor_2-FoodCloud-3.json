They also have more priviledges than just workers that don't have the magic word \"manager\" \" or \"head of\" next to their title. - The HR is a joke. The head is not a nice person, often very rude and dismissive, zero emphaty. I know of people who mentioned their mental health and have been looked down on from the HR, as if they were idiots. - No benefits, other than the government benefits. Forget about anything on Christmas or any annual bonus to say thank you. - There might be some good managers there, but my experience is of a very sneaky manager who has been caught in several lies and does not support the team at all. Just says what they think others want to hear, but act differently. Becomes easily defensive and offensive."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Low pay, the company doesn't value employees", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "5 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Customer Support Specialist in Dublin, Dublin", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The job itself is nice and meaningful\r\nLovely people in the whole company\r\nGood as a first job to gain some experience", "cons": "- No real benefits\r\n- Salary raise is very little if even any\r\n- No bonus\r\n- Cheap equipment to work which isn't working properly - slow PC, cheap chairs, headsets etc\r\n- Employees aren't valued.
