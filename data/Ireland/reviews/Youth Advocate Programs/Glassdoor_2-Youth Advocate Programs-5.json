High staff turnover due to poorly qualified and tokenistic management structures.  Say all the right things, but deliver little to full-time employees. One particular director is invisible in the organisation and serves little in assisting in the smooth relations in the organisation. Senior management are afraid of change and staff members regularly report and suggest more efficient work processes, which are then inevitably turned down and eventually employed years down the line. No trust in the skill sets, qualifications and experience of team members to effect positive change, presumably running the risk of compromising their own competence in senior management.
