(Maybe that's totally normal in science - in order to progress, you have to look at yourself first. Or maybe it is just normal for PhD students because that'll make you finish sooner.)\r\n\r\nMany supervisors seem to be over-ambitious. They rather get projects started fast and in the way they want - rather than listening to others (including their own PhD students or anybody who is working with these techniques a major part of their time), trying to understand their points and then deciding together for the best solution.\r\n\r\nPublish or Perish seems to be written in capitals for many people here.\r\n\r\nPhD students are the cheapest workers and have to do things for which technicians should actually be employed. If you'd tell somebody in industry what activities you use someone with a first degree for, they would be in tears - either from laughing or from crying or both.\r\n\r\nPhD students get a salary that is appalling compared to the fact that these people have a finished degree already. Oh, and compared to cost of living in this city as well.\r\n\r\nSupervisors mistake summer students as helpful for PhD students. Unskilled workers in a work that requires skill and experience are NOT helpful! And they should neither be given their own projects and (useful or even correct) results expected, nor should they be assigned to individual PhD students - who only loose time and nerves with training these from scratch. Summer students should walk around with technicians and give them a hand. They must be seen as medium-term investment (when they might come back), but not as short term help - because they are no help!\r\n\r\nSome of the rooms that PhD students are sitting in for the majority of their work time are actually dreadful and will not spark ideas nor allow concentrated, efficient working.\r\n\r\nMost 3rd and 4th year PhDs have only one wish: leave as soon as possible (= once handed in). Many have mentally quitted their job already. Many retract to the barely necessary things to fulfil their own job - but absolutely nothing else beside it that would cause more unpleasant work or could cause any elongation of their time there. This makes it hard to collaborate with many experienced people.\r\n\r\nTrying to change something / anything may cause resistance / ignorance from others and not get appreciated or positively valued at all. One might loose all motivation to change even the smallest thing if it's doomed to be received negatively in most cases.
