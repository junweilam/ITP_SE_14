I have worked for Affinity since 2011 after being Tuped over from a health authority. I feel that Affinity are totally focussed on giving the people supported a totally person centred approach and opportunities to grow and develop to be valued members of the community. Support staff are encouraged to use their own initiative to create good quality support plans alongside the people they support and are given management support to do so. The people supported and the staff know all the management team who all visit the houses on a regular basis which ensures we provide a personal service. Meetings are held regularly with senior managers to keep information current which is then passed down to support workers to ensure a high quality service. Staff are encouraged through 1 to 1 meetings to discuss new ideas and to ensure training is up to date to ensure skills are kept fresh and to look at areas people may be having difficulty in. I feel Affinity do what they say on the box which is to encourage people with a learning disability to pursue active and fulfilled lives. We have grown as a service in a short space of time nearly doubling in size in our area  due to reputation  and positive feedback of others.,0.00088538334,0.0017997015,0.9973149

To start with the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. You feel you are in safe hands. Management: Starting with the million dollar smile CEO He is an amazing person. Not sure how he manages to make sure each of us are being noticed acknowledged appreciated. Best CEO i have ever worked considering my experience with previous 3 companies. he is fun loving and full of energy. Talking about our India head She is very friendly with everyone. She takes interest and involvement in our career building. I was hesitant and scared when i joined as i found her bit strict as a manager but now i find her more as a friend. Seniors here are there to guide you at every single step. I feel fortunate to work with such amazing people. I discuss about my office life with my friends and family too. Fellowmates: Here everyone is very helpful and friendly. I have made such beautiful relationships here. Like everything about this company.,0.0003705949,0.000888253,0.9987412

Management is very supportive of our ideas and suggestions and also provide additional training to continue learning new skills. The office environment is friendly and superiors are looking out for your best interests. Aimfill is changing significantly and bringing in a new culture. I would recommend working here particularly if you are younger going forward.  Good benefits and salaries great perks and revenue shares and above all enjoy working with good people. :)  It’s common knowledge that helping employees set and reach goals is a critical part of every manager’s job. Our CEO Fazil Mohammed Basheer setting the right targets makes this connection explicit for him and for me as one of his managers. As targets are rarely pursued in a vacuum our CEO suggests to help us people understand who we are dependent on to achieve those goals. For nothing but I just want to use this space to thank him as well for all best things that he helped us to learn being in this company.  Also by the way our CEO is going to have a very good time insha Allah with sparkling young minds of Aimfill International. :),0.00038022103,0.00068539754,0.9989343

Reaching this Campus from any part of the city is easy as its located close by to Railways Station bus Terminus and frequent Auto and taxi Services.   Another excellent thing in the College.  Excellent Staffing.  Each and every staff is good qualified and most importantly very friendly.  They teach things even out of the book.     I was much satisfied with Staff and their Stuff.   The Courses wer not that professional. I mean they just give out outlines of the course and nothing in deep. But they give out a lot of practical experiences and this was very helpful for Students,0.0011016612,0.005610247,0.9932881

Anthill Creations a social startup was 2 year old with around 810 team members when I started working with them and there were multiple ongoing and pipeline projects with strict deadlines. Naturally I expected a lot of chaos in terms of project management and everything in between. But for a Startup this firm truly had good understanding of people management task planning and employee recognition  3 most important tools for any organization's success.  What stood out to me rather what made me stick with them even after my internship termition is the freedom and decision making power that resides with each and every team member.,0.028228767,0.4680138,0.5037575
Since the firm is really scaling up there would be a lot of upcoming projects in remote corners of India and other countries.

I am a Nurse and I have decided to move out from this hospital but before that a couple of things I would like to mention here .The working environment is pathetic as the hospital is a family run business and  nepotism is one of the major issue in this hospital . The fear of losing  once job always instigated to control the staff members  rampant job cut and and overburdening  of staff members is the other thing which I have experienced in the hospital . The hospital management is unsure about where they have to keep tabs on and where they shouldn't . The provident fund is the other issue the hospital contributions to your provident fund is absolutely nothing and for that the hospital management deduct everything from employees salary which is something I never heard of my entire career . Joining in this hospital would be one of the biggest  gaffe one can commit in their entire life .,0.9988807,0.0009756234,0.00014369842

Salaries of most of the employees are extremely low. Even as low as Rs. 11000 a month.  No benefits are given and no work life balance. Sundays are also working most of the times. No appreciation of work. Minimum 23 employees were sacked each month. The top management is very unprofessional in their approach and seemed to have no knowledge of handling their hospital.

 The organization provides a lot of growth opportunities in various domains for each and every employee to grow as an individual and excel in their domain.   Bask doesn't follow hierarchy system hence all the employees are provided equal opportunities to grow and excel in their domains of interest.   Work life balance can be easily achieved in the organization.  A great organization to work with if one wants to shape their research skills and work in different domains.,0.0010782788,0.0013947623,0.99752694
 Since it is a small organization one might find it difficult to handle more than one projects at a time.   A person needs to be self motivated and disciplined enough to work with the organization.,0.99098724,0.008839437,0.00017327219
1. General experience: You will be working on sociallydriven projects for creating tangible impact at the grassroots level. However the nature of work and field exposure may vary based on the job role and assigned project. Apart from this Bask invests in the capacity building of employees through workshops and shortterm courses.  2. Organizational structure: Bask has a flat hierarchy and all employees are very approachable.  3. Work culture: An inclusive encouraging and agile work culture encouraging diverse ideas for fostering innovation and creative problemsolving. The top management is always willing to discuss and provide guidance to develop as a professional/researcher within and outside the organization.  4. Managing work: Bask provides freedom flexibility and autonomy to lead the projects and grow as a project manager. Additionally the organization is well connected to the domain experts to avail expertise and resources whenever required.  5. Teams: Back in 2020 we were still a small and closelyknit team. We use to participate in social and sports activities such as trekking and half marathons together. I believe that the team has grown significantly since then.,0.00045325301,0.003277734,0.996269

British Council literally ruined my career. I was in the interview and background check process from the last 2 and a half months. When they offered me a salary it was not so good but HR asked me to join the company as they are providing permanent work from home. So i said yes to the same. After completing the entire procedure of background check and interviews which was very time taking. I went to the office to join on the 5th sept. As soon as i got in touch with my line manager. He mentioned how you will travel this far daily so i mentioned its WFH and line manager simply denied. He mentioned its permanent work from the office. When i informed him that i got this information from the HR team multiple times he mentioned that right now we cannot do anything about it and this option of WFH is not on the table. Now i cannot join the company as i live in a different city and the salary that they offered me was good for WFH only. Now I don't have a job as i left my last one for this company and they are not simply saying it was jst wrong information shared by HR and it seems they don't care about it. Thank you so much for ruining my career. I will post this on each and every site that exists so that you will not ruin someone else's career. #liars British Council,0.99846965,0.0013590937,0.00017125931

Management don't really manage things  they just sit on the top and set rules overwork you and then judge you and ignore basic HR guidelines. When we question whats happening  we are told that we need to demonstrate the right 'behaviours' and not 'ruin our reputation'. Basically there is no positive goodwill built between management and employees... my goodwill was destroyed the first week I started. People stop caring about the job when they realise management don't care about them. And then it just becomes about rinsing money and getting away with minimum work without going noticed. It is truly a depressing environment.,0.9986451,0.001176679,0.00017822375

too many negative points: 1. their retention rate is too low. you will hardly find old employees. All good employees leave. Why? here's the reason:  HR never treats you with respect especially Ashish who is HR Manager  Very poor salary hikes. only 1500 2000 rupees no matter how much work you do for department. Even people who don't do any work and remain on leaves always also get same hike. then where's the difference.  no personal growth. teachers never get chance to teach other subjects. keep on teaching same 1 or 2 subjects for all years until you leave this organization n this will stop your career growth.  too much document work and resubmission of same documents again and again shows poor management.  no benefits given to employee.  no maternity leave. They will say u r eligible for 2 months paid leave and in the end will give you only 50% of 1 month by saying its our policy we give 50% of 50%. OMG In short Chandigarh university is earning so much from students' fees but is keeping everything in its own pocket and dont like to give anything to their employees. totally business.  HODs condition is worse. They dont get any vacations. have to stay till late night during audits and all saturdays working.  Sometimes they even call on Sunday and make it mandatory for silly events.,0.999032,0.00080715993,0.00016075048

Remote location: Chandigarh University is located in Mohali which is a bit outside the main city of Chandigarh. This remote location might not be convenient for individuals who prefer to live or work in the heart of a bustling city. Limited industry exposure: Although Chandigarh University offers a range of academic programs its location away from major metropolitan areas might limit opportunities for industry exposure and collaboration with renowned companies and professionals. This could affect networking and career growth prospects. Limited research opportunities: While Chandigarh University emphasizes research and innovation it might not provide the same level of research opportunities and resources as some of the toptier universities in larger cities or research hubs. This could be a disadvantage for researchers or academicians looking for extensive research collaborations and funding. Cultural diversity: Chandigarh University attracts a significant number of students from the local region and nearby states. As a result the cultural diversity within the campus might be relatively limited compared to universities located in more cosmopolitan areas. This might affect the exposure to different cultures and perspectives for both faculty and staff. Housing and amenities: Mohali where Chandigarh University is situated might not offer as many housing options or amenities as a larger city like Chandigarh. This could be a consideration for individuals who value a wide range of recreational activities dining options and cultural experiences outside of work.,0.9982218,0.0016225833,0.0001556705

Separate Cultural Carnivals Sports Meet Teachers’ Day Celebration and many other  events are organised for the faculty only to showcase their talent. Faculty is encouraged to pursue research and higher studies and the management gives full support in that. And in case you wanna pursue your doctorate from the university itself you will be given 50% discount in the programme fee (isn’t it great?). And the biggest reason to work here is lucrative remuneration and good annual appraisals as compared to other private colleges and universities in the region. The Chancellor of the university even conducts Open House Sessions for the faculty and welcomes all suggestions and listens to the grievances and work upon them asap.

While writing cons I don't want you to get disappointed with the system but then you have no other choice but to accept these hard facts. Being an Assistant Professor you will be involved in various other activities such as lots of  unnecessary documentation and will be even asked to generate admissions for university. You will be deputed on calling duties prepare documents for your seniors (you will treated as Type 4 workers by most of the old employees).  You have to deposit  a cheque (equivalent to your salary)  so that they should be assured of your employment. LWPs are very common. Just commit a small error (not even a mistake)  you will be marked LWP.  Ex You have not forwarded the email on time  LWP. They hardly pay any attention towards quality education  trust me if you really consider teaching as you passion (apart from just employment thing)  then this is not right place for you. Getting approval on leaves will give you the worst ever headache of life. There are multiple bosses and you will be struggling between them. Saturdays off (only 3 or 4 Saturdays in a year) don't go by the word of HR they will lure you by saying 70% of Saturdays are off. I have never ever witnessed those 70 %. You can be invited to university campus anytime without prior information. There will be calls/messages even at late in the night. When you are an employee you are to happy to serve them if they honour your sacrifice.  NO SINGLE SATURDAY IS EXTRA PAID.  Official Timings are 9:30 to 4:30 but please spare 2 hours more because generally in this organisation meetings are scheduled post 4:30 pm. If you are a new employee (whether you have done masters/phd from reputed universities such as NIT/IIT/IIM)  then you have to bear the burnt of those seniors which don't have any credible academic background.  You'll come across various Non UGC NET/SET qualified employees. I was deputed in South Campus  getting a glass of cold water will be a privilege for you  not your right. I have raised several issues but they hardly put any effort to resolve them I left this organisation in just few months  you can expect the amount of social cost I have actually paid.

I have nothing  good to say about this organisation. Office politics is too much here. You need to keep your manager happy all the time otherwise you may get fired from job; any time without notice. The one who keeps talk bad about others survive for long.  Basically it is a funding agency. Due to lack of strict monitoring system most the the implementing partners and  Program Managers  have become super rich. Suppose when you visit any partnering organisation for monitoring purpose and if you find any malpractice or financial misappropriation you should keep yourself blind. IF you bring this to the notice of Child Fund management then next day you will be fired... Programs/Policies on paper are really good but when it comes to the implementation it is worst. I pity the donors from all over the world who donate. Not even 5% of money reaches the children.,0.99496055,0.0048151407,0.00022429138

There was a time when they managed to lure in some top talent. Some of them are still here and the processes set by them are still here.

"Nearly all the things told to us at the time of interviews and selection have been lies. Complete overstatements of salaries responsibilities projects transparency etc.  There is no training when we join just some repetitive self boasting of what they've done in the past.  ""Leaders"" are decided at random without justification and truly only by a few people. No newcomers regardless of their caliber or the promises made to them are elevated to leadership. Micromanagement and miniscule inconsequential mistakes are pointed out to bury them down Policies are made at the whims and fancies of people in these ""leadership"" positions. If they're late to work the late times are shifted. If they need saturdays off that happens. I am yet to understand how some of the people have been recognized as the executive level leaders despite being underqualified immature unskilled and having no real talent or experience in management of a company",0.99861956,0.0012258614,0.00015462098
I cant really think of any pros of joining this organization.

"It is like a college dorm where a few underqualified and unskilled people dictate and change rules job scopes and what not. Till date I have not been paid my salary on time or been given the kind of work that I was promised. I see my colleagues being bored by mundane work which frankly any Class 12 pass can do.  The concept of promotions or career growth doesn't exist here. The entrenched club of graduates who currently control the organization will continue to control it in the foreseeable future.I am yet to see the ""dynamic young organization that is changing India"" that they advertise and use to attract employees.  Join this organization only if you are desperate and have no other options.

Draconian rules about half a day's salary deducted if you are 30 mins late full day's if you are an hour late. Saturdays are working days unofficially though they are supposed to be holidays. They promise you a certain amount of pay when you join but only pay you about half of the promised amount every month. There are no major projects for the company and it is in bad financial shape.  The management is arrogant and doesn't care about the employees. People are insulted routinely and made to feel as if the organization is doing them a favour by retaining them. The middle management routinely belittles the junior employees and takes all the credit for their work.  Overall I would not come to this organization if I were a prospective employee again.,0.9990477,0.00077940174,0.00017292393

The quality of management is very poor with no sanctity for promises made to employees. Salaries that are promised are not paid with lower amounts being paid in a delayed manner.  Several vendors and exemployees are owed large amounts of money by the organization and it doesn't look like they will get paid.  The roles are not structured with people having overlapping responsibilities. This encourages a large amount of infighting and internal politics thus enabling the top management to have a freereign.  Policies are changed as and when the management feels like doing so sometimes with retrospective effect thus creating a lot of confusions and resentment among employees.,0.999081,0.000767207,0.0001517858

I was lured with an offer that was extremely competitive and the promise of a job scope that seemed very attractive. Once I joined I was told by a consultant that I would get only half of what I was promised (salary) but that this would be reviewed after 3 months.   I stuck on as I was still interested in the job scope. Post this period my salary was unchanged and my job scope was just making presentations without any objective. We kept making presentations to each other and nit picking each other's work. Finally we were told that the project was scrapped and that we should find new projects to work on. It was a complete waste of my time.  I don't think any company treats MBA passouts of the top business schools in the country in this manner.,0.99532616,0.0042610797,0.00041276886

This is my second stint at CUTS and It is always a pleasure working for CUTS. I have worked at Business Chambers Government Enterprises but somehow I have always felt enjoying my work more at CUTS than in other places. It's the excitement teamwork independence travel fieldlevel experiences and scope to interact with so many distinguished people both in India and abroad that I treasure more than anything else.  Pros:    Teamwork and encouragement from senior colleagues.    Scope to work on multiple issues.   Trust and encouragement from the seniors who do not get into micromanagement unless it is absolutely essential.   The space that one gets to think and act independently.   Encouragement from the seniors to introduce innovation in approach.   The scope to contribute to the overall betterment of the grassroots communities.,0.00053948915,0.0014291741,0.9980313

This is my second inning at CUTS International starting December 2020. I earlier work for more than six years from April 2009 to April 2015. I like this organisation for several reasons some important ones are as follows:   1) Highly engaging environment 2) a good learning platform for career progression for freshers 3) diversity of work to keep one busy all the times 4) highly networked organisation with its work well recognised globally 5) very good at project planning and implementation.,0.00017463964,0.0003540808,0.99947125

"They published a couple of ""newspapers"" back in the '80s and are still ripping people and national/international donors off it.   This is hands down one of the top ten worst places to work at in Jaipur.  Most of the people working here (and leaving this place) are not even remotely techfriendly which explains the lack of reviews. A couple of other reviews are misattributed.   The Cons are too many:   Poor paymaster. The ""increments"" are remarkably low.    Unsafe working environment especially for females.   Stinky office with poor infrastructure. The male and female washroom has a common window  yes that's right   which overlooks into each other.   Negative and destruction work environment. The employees are constantly scared.   Highly political environment. The Management itself indulges in and propagates work politics.    Extremely rude disrespectful egotistical bosses and top management. CUTS is not an organisation it is a familyowned business run by the highhanded uncultured family. Their favourite word has to be "" you're terminated"". These people are highly vindictive.    Obsolete unreasonable and futile ""processes"". A lot of micromanagement  the management loves to create an atmosphere full of tension.   Very high attrition rate.    Weird ""disciplinary""policies which are nothing but domineering and vigilance tactics. Example: you can't leave your seat without informing someone. And if you do you better be back in 5 minutes.    Poor policies with lots of loops.    Dead end jobs with no future or growth.   The HR team is a joke. Uncouth and crude.   Invalid deductions no PF no bonuses no other incentive.   Extreme exploitation. They'll favour the favourites though. Ones who are their sycophants.    Again I would strongly advise the smart ones to stay away from this place which claims to be an organization. Especially those talented millennials  you can do better! You don't deserve to and frankly shouldn't dedicate yourself to such conceited uncouth vindictive and apathetic bunch  to whom the employees the people basic human decency don't matter.   This world is changing fast organizations like CUTS don't cut it anymore and sooner or later they'll know it.",0.99877053,0.0010730823,0.00015635256

Random arbit decisions don t require professionals but puppets and yes men and WOMEN (preferably pretty and young)wasteful expenditure of donor's money work with handpicked consultants and vendors with whom deals and contracts are done which defy all principles lack of competitive practices in procurement   incompetent staff croynism and favoritism poor whimsical arbitrary gang of leadership headed by mama and papa and a young ex astronaut lack of governance regulatory climate leadership draw obscene salaries unmatched with their skills/competencies/contribution nil governance or accountability meetings and offsites held for weeks in seven star hotels  with money taken from donors in the name of disadvantaged farmers.   Unceremoniously terminate  those honest well intentioned staff who espouse compliance policies  and prudent use of donor money.  conning the donors with a weak program  and disregard for any due diligence or internal controls. High risk for donors but must join for those wanting to learn 100 strategies of getting donor money and burning it. For instance if they want to fire an employee who is not falling in line with their highrisk irregularities they  first contract an expensive  firm for restructuring their organization and then call an offsite of 100 staff in goa (from all over the world) and then tell those 2/3 staff that your role does not fit in our new  structure so please write a resignation and leave.

Sharing some open feedback I wish  DRF takes it seriously. Disclaimer:For an employee their team and managers is the worldso my comments would not be the accurate representation of the entire organization   1.  The current organisation culture needs much improvement. The worst experience in my entire professional life is from DRF. My managers used to shout at me everyday sitting in the Head Office They never bothered to visit the field regularly to understand what's happening out there.  2. HR is the worst to deal the conflicts with the manager. Eventually the baton always ends up reaching the manager to mess up employees life. 3. The bossy nature of people should be completely  wiped off.,0.99875057,0.0010989011,0.00015051026

Hire and fire policy from the management. They will  seek your attention by posting a JD stating that they are doing something for upbringing the society. But after joining there you will realize that the social upbringings is not their priority. Pleasing the partners to fund their program to run the program. They have a very blurred vision. HR is useless and if the partners decide to shut down a center they will do it mercilessly. They are simply ruining people's career by their   brainless management.,0.99843305,0.0013955255,0.00017134042

No appraisal IJP rejection QA rejection eye vision getting squeezed juniors making as much as me mates relaxing post promotion etc. I'm not blaming anyone but I think it brings back to the title ""Not so fruitful"".

Working with GiveIndia has been a great experience for me. It was my first job after graduating with an engineering degree. Although it is a non profit the working culture is as good as any other major corporate house. I was part of its online team where I got to learn multiple modern tools(especially related to web designing) and I am still  reaping benefits of it. Moreover my lead was a very good mentor she had helped me grow by trusting in me and providing opportunities at multiple facets. The team at Giveindia was diverse and fun to work with. It included people from different backgrounds. And last but not the least the feel good factor that you experience to see that your daily work is contributing to help someone else's life and the moral values that you inherit for the rest of your life is incomparable.,0.00025502834,0.00045445882,0.99929047
Although the salaries were on par with any other mid size firm it is still less when compared to  elites and it will be difficult to stay motivated if money is only thing that  you are looking after.,0.997331,0.0025296854,0.00013938501
Give India not only has a great vision it is backed up by a talented team to realise this vision. The work ethic and transperancy works all the way up to the top management. Its a fun workplace and more importantly employees are owners of their work their goals and their leaves. Yes! take a leave if you need it as long as you display honesty and integrity. The leave policy and general HR policies are liberal and humane. Lastly  the org structure is flat and not driven by hierarchy.   If you want to work in the development/NGO space but also like the agility  structure and focus of a corporate/startup environment Give India would be a great option.,0.0011708782,0.0034545816,0.9953746

1) They have an open door policy 2) Professional approach 3) Very transparent 4) Employees are respected and treated well 5) Ample opportunity to learn and grow 6) Kind hearted and warm people work here  I worked for GiveIndia for over 2 years and they were very fruitful years in terms of experience. I worked there when Dhaval was the CEO so don't know much about the new Head.

The flattened hierarchy of the company has made the things very transparent and this is the reason HR  of Giveindia is so strong.

The company culture thrives around the the experience of the Fellows themselves and tends to attract an amazing clientele of young leaders and curious global citizens ready to explore the world.    It has a young and experimental vibe there is lots of enthusiasm as the firm expands and refines its product. The organization is extremely vocal about why we do what we do exploring and refining quality at every step of the way it is a great way to get familiar with Design Thinking and building the bridge year movement from the ground up.   It provides great training and travel opportunities internationally and locally and exposure to students and situations of all kinds.  It will provide great insight into experiential education and intercultural adaptation emergency response and the international workplace.,0.00019319398,0.00023856726,0.9995683
Practically speaking there is little security in terms of your position expectations or day to day tasks. The firm is attempting rapid expansion and the workplace is highly chaotic and unreliable in terms of what it can promise employees for the year let alone a longer career.    Although they try to focus on highest quality student experience they have yet to refine a lot of the baseline logistical and internal processes at the firm.  Your job may regularly ask you to move change roles or tasks with minimal training and in a fast paced work environment.  This refers to location compensation colleagues and worklife balance.   The Communication and feedback model between the US based headquarters and various field staff is yet to be fluid and effective.    The turnover can be fastpaced meaning that it is rare to meet someone truly experienced who has been around long enough to support a stable company culture and work environment.    At times there is a lot of talk about ethics and values which is great; but at times lacking is practicality and this can be extremely frustrating and exhausting when already working in a chaotic working environment.,0.99786735,0.0018762795,0.00025636263

1. They offer a decent pay. 2. A lot of responsibility was given right from the start.,0.23608722,0.21246684,0.55144596
1. Was not clearly told that I would have to travel all alone to offbeat isolated places that don't have even basic amenities. Reimbursement process is broken. The offer letter said I MAY have to travel but the role was not explained in the beginning. 2. The job title was that of a manager but I was technically an executive who worked as a content writer and editor. I didn't have to manage anyone at all. Very misguiding. 3. Not at all a good place for atheists. Every Monday they force their employees for an hour to listen to Bible readings and discussions of company policies on the basis of Christianity. It was shocking to see many nonChristians and nonCatholics participating in such illogical activities. Throughout my short tenure religion was constantly being shoved down my throat which was a major issue for me. 4. Inefficient HR. They planned a company outing and had hired 2 buses to take the employees to the location. One bus driver was caught with no legal documents the other almost drove a bus filled with many employees down the cliff. Joining this company can lead to you losing your life. Yet my manager complained about me not going for the outing. 5. The manager would leave me with no task to perform the entire day and then would give a task at 6 in the evening right when I had packed up and was leaving for home. Just plain harassment. 6. As they are understaffed as soon as I joined I was given a lot of tasks and the previous employee was given hardly any work. 7. A lot of the stuff I worked on was just deleted or completely disregarded. No communication was made regarding why the things I worked on were just removed by the manager. 8. Was never given even a workdesk throughout my tenure of 1.5 months. I used to sit crammed between two desks with no personal space or even a place to keep my things. 9. For an NGO it is ironic that most people who worked here especially the management are selfrighteous boastful and arrogant. 10. No security person. It was risky working here till late as any intruder could barge into the section where I was working. 11. Was made to work even before my official date of joining. I was not compensated monetarily for that ever. 12. The manager made me work on holidays and when I would apply for compensatory offs they would be rejected straightaway with no explanation. My manager who was a male would work till 1 or 2 in the morning and would expect women in the company to do the same regardless of there being no security. The company acts like it owns you. No worklife balance. Most people I saw around me would be online on job portals hunting for jobs to escape this horrible company.,0.9989513,0.00088560773,0.00016304344

Organisation makes decisions which result in terrible service to the tenants. It was embarrassing trying to defend such poor service and their catastrophically brutal budget cuts.There seems to constantly be a restructure each one starts just as staff are getting used to  new way of working and before anyone has really had a chance to see if it works. I left just over a year ago in the last restructure (voluntarily I might add) and there is already another restructure happening again. This constant uncertainty is not conducive to an emotionally healthy place to work.All the perks (flexi time office hours every weekend off) went in the last restructure with no pay increase to soften the blow.After being there for 10 years employees gradually felt less and less cares about and more of a number of a commodity which can easily be replaced.,0.99885,0.0009821303,0.00016791456

I was working as a full time employee with Hult International Business School MumbaiIts one of the worst places to work if you have self respect and integrity.  Senior management is totally biased and hiring and firing is the most common practice there(either you are fired or you are forced to resign if you want to save your career from getting hampered by being terminated). Personal commitments are not respected.Your growth or performance is not co related to how you performits based on how your equation is with your manager/management is on a personal level.The 360 degree feedback is just a formalityno actual feedback is taken from the employee and is worked upon by the management.

1. They tell u they care about your mental health but it's the total opposite. Late working hours no appreciation no appraisals no empathy. 2. They show dat they are doing amazing work for the education community but they really are only serving the powerful and the rich. 3. People leave this org left right and center. And they never even address it to the team! Insulting!!! No closure 4. Bad for newcomers because they never give enough time for people to settle in. They throw stuff at them like it's a circus. 5. They make sure you can't have a life  6. Everyone talks how their attrition is beyond the roof. Every 6 months a new team. 7. The CEO watches everyone from his room theirs cctv everywhere!!!! Can you believe it this 2022????! 8. Pay is terrible & you are made to feel bad if you ask for a deserved appraised 9. They make you feel bad about your work and employees are regularly compared with each other. 10. They hate when you take leaves. They love people who can work 24 hours a day 365 days a year. They keep Saturdays working sometimes. 11. No clarity in your managers/leads. All last moment stuff. Everything is run by just 1 person. And then they blame you when things fail! 12. I heard that they asked employees to take pay cuts in the pandemic year and never paid them back!!!,0.9985172,0.0012363971,0.00024634917

The IDEX program really provides you the opportunity to excel professionally and accelerate your career. You'll get access to mentors opportunities a supportive team and passionate changemakers. I'd recommend you fully utilize all these channels during your fellowship. You'll regret it when the program is over. During my time as a Fellow I met with every mentor that IDEX had us introduced us too and was even personally introduced to mentors based on my interests. I took on interesting side projects got critical feedback on my ideas learned a lot about becoming a social intrapreneur and built a network of peers & mentors. By the end of my fellowship I was even offered numerous jobs by social enterprises in India. Lastly IDEX has stayed in touch with me and been supportive postfellowship too.,0.000861914,0.0027817308,0.99635637
IDEX does not hold your hand throughout the fellowship. If you're a selfstarter humble an adventurer and genuinely passionate about becoming a social intrapreneur / entrepreneur  — it's the perfect program for you. But if you're expecting someone to guide through your fellowship personally you'll be disappointed. Their team will provide you with support as needed but you're treated as an adult don't expect anyone to chaperone your experience.,0.20151809,0.7930978,0.005384099
The best part of the IDEX Accelerator programme is the friendships you create with the other iDEX fellows. They are very supportive and sincere we share our experiences and grow together.  The reading material IDEX provides is pretty good albeit an overload. The mentors they connect with you are knowledgeable on their subject and they give you plenty of advice.,0.00021338304,0.00033623583,0.9994504
The problem with IDEX Accelerator is their lack of association with the placements and placement mentors. No solid structure is in place for you to be guaranteed a fulfilling experience at your placement. This can be due to either the placement not being a social enterprise by that I mean the organisation's initial purpose of social impact is nonexistent. Secondly your placement mentor/manager doesn't have a structure in place to guide your experience and even give you work justifying your purpose being here. Some placement mentor/manager's will also carry a negative attitude.   Many of my cohort that I was part of suffered from those two points and many of us we're disheartened that a lot of money and time was sacrificed in order for us to be here. What we weren't made aware of was that our placements paid for our time we came here on the assumption that we we're doing our work voluntarily.  If you are considering this please do think hard. There are many other similar fellowships out there that have a solid structure for the fellows free of any major costings that are transparent and most importantly are empathetic towards your experience.,0.99755365,0.0022545592,0.00019185156

 The Associate track at IDinsight is for people who are looking to start out as generalists into the development sector. There is a lot of mentorship and support that happens throughout your time at IDinsight and it can serve as a stepping stone to a more specific development sector career track. Alternatively IDinsight gives you enough practical experience to seek out other careers.  Living in the countries that IDinsight operates in is another draw  the salary that IDinsight provides is more than enough to live comfortably. It's a great opportunity to live and work abroad if you're not from that country.  The people at IDinsight are great  it's nice be surrounded by so many curious and interesting people.

 IDinsight is a small company so you often don't have a lot of control over your staffing opportunities. Projects can also vary a lot in quality so your experience at IDinsight is highly dependent on the projects you are staffed on so sometimes it can feel like things are out of your control.  IDinsight is still working to have a more diverse workforce. In the Indian context more progress can be done to hire people from different castes and religions.

– Smart passionate and hardworking colleagues – Ideal entrylevel positions – Associates are given a lot of autonomy (when shown ready) and are the ones driving projects. The Associate role allows you to develop a diversity of skills including technical skills (evaluation design; data collection cleaning and analysis etc.) and social skills (client relationships management during fieldwork etc.) – Diversity across all levels of hierarchy (as in fact everybody can see on the website) – Transparent 360° performance review in place – providing detailed feedback on areas of improvement and informing promotion decisions  – Impact first – informing everything from project selection to hiring. Make an argument on how IDinsight could increase its social impact and you will always be heard. – Clear focus on performance rather than input – generally managers don’t care too much about how you do your work as long as you deliver good quality efficiently. – IDinsight is growingly rapidly thus there are still a lot of opportunities to shape how the organization is operating. – Organization values your professional development – you are encouraged to write and follow a professional development plan and make time for it during workweek.,0.0036146755,0.005115594,0.9912697
– Not the right place for you if you require close supervision to thrive; sometimes not as close mentorship as you would see for example in management consulting (depends on the project though) but you will receive guidance and support if you’re asking for it. – Not the right place for if you’re semisure about your commitment to impact – must be willing to take up with extended stays in rural areas and sometimes long hours. – Strategic communications and IDinsight brand still relatively poor outside the social sector – this may affect your exit options if you want to leave the social/development sector after IDinsight (but most Associates either stay in the social/development sector or go to grad school for which it is great).,0.99635786,0.0033876048,0.00025449632

I have worked at LEAD for almost 15 years since its inception and I feel it has been a great experience. I have learnt a lot in terms of research management skills field data collection and in particular I got the opportunity to develop specific skillsets in learning and communications building networks brand management policy and advocacy and training.

1. You can have positions that sound fancy  Research Associate Research Manager etc. Plus since IFMR once housed JPAL and EPoD you can share a little limelight but honestly most have caught up with the fact that IFMR isn't even 1/10th of those organisations in research standards and the quality of projects  2. The RAs who join (and later inevitably leave) are one of the most talented bunch in the industry it's a shame that they would join this organisation which does not train them and gives them no regards,0.9968868,0.0028752617,0.00023793976
1. If you are an RA you are guaranteed a terrible time no matter which vertical you're in. The upper management will throw you from one project to another like a rag doll. Once you actually get comfortable with your work you will be on the way to another study  without your consent or any other info whatsoever.   2. It has gotten to the Upper management's head that PI projects are bad for the organisation so they are being entrepreneurial and starting their own projects  a skill they seriously lack.  3. If you need to count decent Research Managers who actually know research one hand will be enough. A good litmus test of how skilled you are is how early you're able to leave the organisation. Those who stay.. well. Either they have no options or they are not skilled enough to join other organisations.,0.995961,0.0038580343,0.000180923

The company is run by really rude folks. There's no room for empathy so most sane folks resign fast. It's some how surviving on the credentials of the main founder and the product founder. Both of them combined have really great credentials and bringing investor money is feasible for them. Over my two years of stay I have seen the worst in them. The company has a lot of attrition (there are always roles available here). Main reasons for the attrition is the pathetic work culture and their narcissistic attitude. I won't really go into the malpractices they are involved in but yes they do indulge in it. Join product if you want a comparatively chill environment (the peer group is atrociously bad though). Join growth if you want a better peer group in terms of skill but be surrounded by sadists and a early burnout is anything but guaranteed. The work culture is really bad and it tends to attract folks who are of a similar attitude or culture. Ones who thrive in office politics and blame games survive and thrive here often staying here for years and years. As a result of this people quickly adapt to not taking feedback and resorting to blame games (especially the newly joined junior folks). It gets to a point where getting work done becomes near impossible. Even though it's a startup it does already feel really rigid. To summarize it all my stay here was a really bad one.

They treat employees like dirt. If there is an issue the founders ignore it assuming it will subside on its own. Or else they will pressurize the department heads or the HR to take the blame. It's reached a really sad level now. People meddling into each other's work even though they don't know anything about it. You or your job or your responsibility  they don't respect this. Somehow the company grew with investor funding and shady practices. Targets don't build a company your employees do. People will put in their papers if the founders keep mismanaging. Even the senior management is running away. That's the last sign of things getting bad. Your growth would have got impacted by years due to all of this. I love the work of saving people. Most people working here do. But if things keep getting worse more people will run away. And for god's sake as founders keep the interdepartment fights in control. Ensure people respect each other's work  for this to happen you have to ensure you do this first. The senior management looks at you and learns from you.,0.99711573,0.0026644284,0.00021984975

 Really bad policies that will create bad equations between the management and employees. Founders need to review this be more sensitive to department requirements limitations and affinities. Same policies cannot be applied everywhere.   Understand and fix the reasons for such large attrition. If there were no problems this wouldn't have been an issue. Genuine fixes need to be rolled out rather than temporary patches.   The HR is grossly incompetent and almost always aggravates issues. This needs urgent intervention. They are not going to be around to face the consequences of bad communication and policies. As founders you are. This company is your baby. And no company can grow without employees sticking around.   The work culture needs to improve. There's a lot of ganging up and politics going around. Those who have been in the system for long and know it exploit it freely. How are new hires going to stick around in that case?,0.99862313,0.0012306472,0.0001461401

Very toxic. Action paralysis from founding team and micromanagement  worked here for 2 years so you can be sure that this advice has many things you have to pickup and fix. Please fix all this.

I had worked for almost 3 years here. And I will be frank that I had a soft spot for this company because of the friends I made. But I'll be frank in my review. When you join Impactguru you will feel very welcome. This is the honeymoon period. However right after a week is when you get a taste of what is going to go wrong. Firstly you will be given a TON of work with absolutely no training. Often the person who you are replacing would have either absconded a long time ago or the incompetent HR team wouldn't have bothered hiring a replacement till the person is out and the pressure comes from various directions. So there is almost a guarantee of not getting a good handover. And this is where the fun begins. Right from the first month the founders will threaten to fire you if you don't perform well. What about the supposed training? They don't care. Add to this some really nasty managers and department heads. If you are the best performer (or the best performing team) expect all the work and blame to come on to you. Things work weird here in that way. This place has some of the worst workplace politics I've worked in. My mom used to advice to leave this place immediately. Your manager will screw you big time if she doesn't like you. You cannot speak up to the management  you will be encouraged to but dare you speak up you will suffer each day from there on. Impactguru HR policies also change on the fly as per their convenience. This was one of the most incompetent HR team I had experienced in my life. They play politics don't communicate policies clearly scheme with the founders and then throw the department heads under the bus for everything. There is no ownership of work here. It's easier playing the blame game and not doing work. Like I said the person working the best will get all the blame. That's how the culture is here. Founders are least bothered and live in their own echo chamber. Rude arrogant and distanced from reality. They will ask you to commit outrageous numbers and targets and then later tie your performance pay to it. Very creative. And then they have the balls to say that you yourself committed to these targets! Sometimes I saw hope. That things will change. A new leader emerges who tries fixing everything. But then they'll just end up leaving fast or absconding when they realize this culture is built from the top. You can't change the founders and a company's culture is dependent on them. All in all there are better places to work in and ensure your mental peace. You want to save lives there are better organizations to join. If nothing works join an NGO that actually does good work. Take care and do good work. Your mental peace and sanity is not worth selling to a sum of money.,0.9975852,0.0022223776,0.0001923743

There will be downsides with every company however this review is purely based on unbiased observations and not a random rant. 1/ They are constantly struggling to reach higher ground than their competitors due to the NEGLIGENCE and INCOMPETENCE of the senior management team. 2/ The senior management team or the department heads doesn't have the required skillsets and expertise to hold their position. They don't even possess proper teamhandling skills and many times team members have to suffer for these shortcomings of theirs. 3/ Worklife balance is 0 so if you are a person who values their personal time don't even think of getting in here until it's absolutely dead needed. 4/ Almost daily you'll find stretching your hours and that will never be compensated. 5/ Alternate Saturdays are working. I hope this review helps you in choosing what you want rather than what is thrown in your bowl.,0.9986524,0.001181777,0.00016587737

There are three tapris outside the office and the entire workforce can be seen there only. Even the tapri owners know that the company is so bad that the employees would want to die hence 3 tapris.

There are so many cons for employees as the company grew their management got awful I worked there for more than a year without my well deserved raise they kept on delaying it. The management gave excuses such as it is normal to wait more than months before the required action was taken. They made us fill out multiple attendance entry and exit procedures even after that their team of HRs were incompatible to track it. Not only a few but the most part of the company faced salary issues that they released later. It wasn't enough that the pay cycle was late but people who have responsibilities would suffer even more. Taking their employees for granted is just an everyday thing. If you want to get into telecalling then only you should work in operations as their entire objective is to make their employees call and call. They would not only pay the dues of last month worked but also the higher management would disrespect and say that other people leaving was somehow my fault and not their company's lacking. They have released a payslip with false information of how much I have received it seems very unethical. I understand that I had to leave in 8 days notice period but that was because of the salary discrepancy in the first place. I was willing to be available as an when I would be able to make time from necessary commitments. I did not expect them to be okay with the arrangements but disrespecting an employee is altogether a different thing. I would personally never work in such an environment.,0.99866986,0.001170679,0.00015953615

 Shady Founder.   Wrong  figures. They had put up the figure of 329 cr two years back but till date we have not seen even 5% of those funds come into the company.   That figure is just there to con the campaigners so they create a campaign with us.   once a campaign is created we force the campaigners to get funds themselves no help from our side.   Management has no idea what they are doing they change the track almost every week.   Founders dont even come to office now a days. They just give you the targets and ask why that is not done on phone.   Outsourced technology infrastructure so no quick solutions to tech problems. Product keeps on not loading or not performing with errors almost everyday.   No leisure activities at all. Very rarely.   At one point of time even our coffee was limited to twice a day.   Managers will show you the moon almost always misleading you with false promises and no results.   BD team is a call center and is operated as one.,0.9990393,0.00081901444,0.00014166924

Very low pay master if you are an ISB Alum you can get here as an Associate Director and get good salaries but if you are an outsider you will always be treated below par as compared to an Alumni of the School. The hiring pattern and policies of the School is very strange. Any one can work or is hired to work in any department without having relevant education or experience. The School hires lot of Alumni instead of outsiders which in my opinion is a bad option. The HR does not exist in this School. No staff engagement activities no R&R no recognition virtually nothing happening here for the staff. At times you feel like working alone. Some departments are overburdened while some are having fun of their lives. If you want to grow in your professional life this place is a straight NoNo. This place is best suited for oldies in their mid 50's to enjoy the last phase of their working career.,0.99836975,0.0014134945,0.00021672611

Limited work at the senior level with great work life balance  you can choose when to go to office. Free perks for Director and above positions such as paid international travel although reality is that there is no traction on the international front in any area. Management can easily cast shadow on board’s eyes!  And also on the house parties are great at top management level  limited and closed invite list with junior staff waiting with hopeful eyes.  Great place for second career or retirement.  Average person can get very good growth here as most staff below average and not capable of leaving even though humiliated every hear in increments by high paid top management.,0.7022195,0.1895034,0.10827712
HR is weak  hiring process not transparent or meritorious.  Alumni and Spouse hiring without any KRA or interview ruining the place.  Maternity leave too long and work suffers at the cost of staff raising babies.  Research institutes not have any work  pity that founders money gone down the drain. Top management generally failed individuals in second career.  Money saved on deans and senior management travel can be used for increments.  Excuse of not having money not believable under free reign of international travel and 5star stay by management.  Management jump at opportunity for free international vacation when reality is they don’t even want to meet domestic clients!,0.998988,0.00082732487,0.00018470688

1. Highly unprofessional staff who go out of their way to inconvenience you.  2. Poorly made policies which are implemented even more abysmally.  3. No clear direction of work and often  no work.  4. Research staff is the cattle class of ISB and about 0% of the senior management cares about them. 5. No growth for research staff and rare appraisals. Appraisals when they happen are random. I had two different appraisals taken by two different heads and then was given a standard raise that was pre decided for the entire research staff. 6. A steady trend of lack of freedom in research writing or in one's professional and personal life (I live on campus and that is a different chapter for a different time) in general. 7. Promotions happen only if you are in your boss' good books.,0.9975648,0.002088077,0.00034710413

"1) No benefits at all. Even Medical Insurance is limited to employee and you have pay from your pocket for your immediate family. Very disappointing 2) Weekends tend to be busy as you will end up spending whole weekend in training. But you know what you are walking into.  3) HR team is non functional and very pathetic. Not even a single appreciation/acknowledgment letter for working on our laptops and using our resources to get company work done. 4) Higher Management has opinion of ""favoring"" the employees by paying salary.

I have been working for over four years in academics consulting and R&D areas at INSOFE. INSOFE is a benevolent company committed to create an authentic workplace on the lines of a learning organization. You can count on the leadership to raise your imagination to the next level. They have an eye to create learning opportunities for you and sustain your enthusiasm for useful work. The mentors are always alive to the composition / demands of the student groups and keep a tab on their behavioural aspects so that the delivery of the course content is suitably redesigned. The projects are benchmarked to be commensurate with the uptake potential of the students. Working backwards the mentors collaborate with data scientists to create a unique experience for every batch of students. You have an assured worklife balance. HR policies provide flexibility to suit the individual needs of the employees. The seniors usher a family culture and are willing to extend any support. The institution attaches lot of importance to the professional development of the data scientists and thus exposes them to number of such programs (e.g. seminars/classes/techtalks/handson workshops peer training challenging projects etc) to improve their competencies. The organization provides structured recreation opportunities on an ongoing basis (indoor games etc) and also at periodical intervals (outings). HR teams organize events to illuminate the ties between employees for harmonious relationships.,0.0063239397,0.0076007443,0.98607534

To be honest every company functions differently you cannot set a benchmark it all depends on the domain the company comes from.

"No work life balance 10 hours a day 7 day work week Management does not care about your health or your mental condition.  If you agree with a few people you will climb the ladder by working as little as 4 hours a day for 3 days a week. If you do not agree with the same people you will not be recognized even if you have the best ideas ideas that work projects to show you capability. None of that matters.  The Big heads of the organization show up once in a while and the flow of information from the lower levels to the Big heads is opaque. Do not bother complaining to anyone your complaints will be used against you.  Very biased Senior scientists at Hyderabad and Bangalore locations. They try to keep a leash on you by using anything. Personal matters are also used as a leverage to keep your mouth shut.  Try asking for a reasonable pay and you are greeted with ""short comings"" from a year ago as the reasons. These ""short comings"" seem to come up only when you need something from the management. These do not come up when you need to work 230 hours a month.  You have to struggle to get your pay false promises are the best this company does. Leaves are not encashed but promised to be encashed.

Present times are rough at India office due to turf war between two senior staff with juniors taking sides. This is detrimental to the image of the organisation. Huge gap in the way the seniors treat research staff and ops staff. The latter is often asked to bend policies to accommodate unreasonable requests of former. Flexi working policy is hugely misused at New Delhi office and is leading to a laid back work culture where people donot respect others time and work commitments. Also this is affecting project deliveries. Too many young staff given huge responsibilities of leading projects and no proper monitoring in place. Work distribution is also not very good.

My PIs and many of my RA friends' PIs were abusive. For many of the JPAL RAs though this is their first job and they don't really know how to speak up for themselves. The organizational structure was such that it was rare if ever that it intervened to protect RAs from abusive American PIs. The general structure of the organization is extremely exploitative and PIs get much more from the experience than RAs. Despite the fact that the RAs are literally indispensable for the research they are literally relegated to a footnote in the paper. In truth RAs bring more value to the research than the PIs. The worst part is that that RAs take this exploitation with the hope that their PIs will give them rla recommendation letter for grad school in the US. Sadly these letters are not as forthcoming as RAs initially expect. To think that students in the US can get the same letters simply for doing well in the professors class a class that meets two times a week for an hour and a half is a level of unfairness that is truly disgusting. I am the only person I am aware of from my time at JPAL that ever ended up in a top notch PhD program in the USA out of almost 10 to 15 close friends who were RAs at the time. A few went to the USA for MBAs but this was the exception not the norm. I am currently un my 4th year at MIT.,0.99828327,0.0015633744,0.00015342601

1. Top notch data skills after two years of experience  2. You will be positioned to work with a team of field staff and professors. So you get to understand on ground realities and connect them theoretically.  3.  Project management skills will be well developed.

Major gap between the professors (PIs) and lower/entrylevel employees. Experience is based purely on the professors the RA ends up working with since quality control is low and no systems are in place to check professors or ensure uniformity in experiences or accountability of the PIs. Suffers from usual international development issues of money being pumped into projects that might not be very useful and which only cater to the professor's tenure needs. Have seen PIs tweak data and field experiences to appeal to donors.,0.99893826,0.0009187168,0.00014301925

There is a reason why people do not do this for their entire life.  The organization requires constant work gives little feedback and largely leaves RA's alone to fend for themselves except when in emergencies it sends more senior staff to babysit them.  There is no work life balance and very little contact with research.  It is a lot of busy work and I feel that many new comers are not accustomed to this kind of work.  The salaries benefits and balance aren't good enough to encourage more mature applicants.,0.9989735,0.00086295744,0.00016359577

" No oversight  No professional development opportunities. PI's don't care about their RA's professional development and if you are joining this position for a letter of recommendation  beware. It is very difficult to form meaningful relationships with the PI's especially if they are senior level PIs.   Chances of being stagnated for long periods of time. You will be wasting your precious time just doing nothing in the ""field"" which are often times remote locations in a developing country. This can be frustrating especially if you are looking forward to developing your skills/learning new things for your own growth.   The opportunity cost of missing out by being isolated is huge.   Don't expect colleagues or PI's to be friendly or helpful if you feel lost at your job in your first few months.",0.9989272,0.0009098332,0.00016296504
I had a terrific PI who was super invested concerned about my career and my aspirations and HELPED a TON (and continues to help even years later)  I don't know a single person who left JPAL who doesn't miss JPAL   JPAL has such great people it really was an immense privilege to work with a bunch of hopeful hard working young people   The work is intense (if you enjoy the work perhaps you won't mind not having a social life for 12 years) valued and gives you so much to think about/mull over,0.0021018574,0.0055214693,0.9923767

You acquire skills that are transferable to other monitoring and evaluation jobs.  You learn to work with remote supervision. It gives you a flavour for what doing a PhD economics might be like especially if you plan to do field experiments.  It is an excellent drill in learning the mechanics of RCTs.

Being a field RA is a very isolating position to be in. You have to deal with pretty unpleasant situations. Navigating relationships can be very tricky especially in managing field staff. PIs can be a bit out of touch regarding field realities. You have to be on call almost 24/7although no one explicitly asks of you it's impossible not work on Saturdays when your field team is working.  Pay is very low.,0.9990038,0.0008347593,0.00016153952

JPAL is a well known organisation especially in the fields of academia and research.

There is a lot of ontheground experience to be had and a lot of opportunity to learn about how research and development projects are implemented. It is an amazing opportunity to gain a lot of knowledge and to improve your technical skills and to see what you've learned in a classroom play out in real life. There isn't a comparable experience in international development or impact evaluation research. Fellow research staff and field staff are all young motivated smart interesting people who form strong communities in each of the field offices and nationally.  If the PIs are involved generous and supportive it can be a wonderful learning experience  it depends entirely on the PIs.,0.00046419745,0.0009840545,0.9985518
Lowpay overwork thankless.   The PIs have complete power in the relationship to assign work and some even delegate their intellectual work including designing experiments and interventions writing grant applications deliverables and papers for which JPAL staff get footnote credit. Given the time difference between professors in the USA and regional field offices work is sometimes assigned in the afternoon USA time to be completed immediately requiring RAs to occasionally pull allnighters to get things done. The PI power dynamic relative to the employees means that the personalities and characters of the PIs can completely shape the employees experience.   As for the organization itself (as versus the PIs) the management has a focus on getting projects done rather than on supporting or respecting employees. The pay scale is very low for the industry is purposefully not transparent and different roles are not paid based on education work experience or workload. Additionally the regional field offices have work conditions such that RAs are sometimes exposed to infectious disease and threats of violence.  The organization has expanded so rapidly that management has not been able to put structures in place to cope with these problems.   Despite this the pros really do outweigh the cons  but for about a year or so. It is a fantastic learning experience. After about a year though burnout sets in from overwork repetitive tasks and feelings of exploitation.   Advice: apply to JPAL do the job for a year then get your letter of recommendation apply to grad school and get out.,0.9975152,0.0020036753,0.0004810958

"Jamia Hamdard is ranked #1 (in Pharmaceutical Sciences) by NIRF and this is a complete ""vicious trap"" for B.Pharm and M. Pharm students. This #1 tag has lured many students in the past years and still continue to do so. Many students come from outside Delhi just to take admission in so called ""#1 pharmacy school (SPER)"" but after spending 4 (four)  and 2 (two) valuable years of their life in B.Pharm and M.Pharm respectively they don't get jobs through campus placement and the college says ""yeah the companies will come sooner to our campus""  But the Pharmacy department (now SPER) has VERY POOR placement record. Very few companies visit the campus. Placement cell in SPER is really very passive.

"I want to express my perspective on Karunya University where I've observed a concerning disregard for hardworking individuals. Unfortunately it appears that the institution has employed individuals with significantly lower caliber even in prominent positions such as the Vice Chancellor. This lack of competence can be disheartening as it hampers the prospects for personal growth and development. Consequently one might experience a sense of disappointment and feel that their time invested in the university is not being utilized effectively.""",0.99884737,0.001008159,0.0001444562

Working at Lifeline Foundation A nonprofit organization makes me proud. It has a solid ethical foundation and throughout the course of the last 5 months of my association with the organization I have learned a lot and still adding to my knowledge. There are no shortcuts taken in the lifeline. The management is very professional. Always ready to offer the right assistance to colleagues who are having difficulties with their duties to start and complete the deadline of any given task or project. one of the things I admire about the organization is the ability to manage multiple projects and teams. Leaves have never been an issue for me. You will be expected to work harder but with that the management will also be generous to grant leave when needed. Ontime salary and job stability are the strong factors of the organization.,0.0019183266,0.004216875,0.9938647

I joined Lifeline Foundation as a fresher and now it’s been more than 2 years I am working in the training department. It will not be wrong to say that the growth I observe in myself is just because of the seniors I work with.   When the whole world is facing crises due to Covi19 lockdown and the work force is in difficulty  Lifeline Foundation and it’s associated companies Baroda Life Management Pvt. Ltd. and Medicare Consultancies made sure to stand by its employees and workers. None of them has to go even a month without their salary. And this is enough to show that if you work here by heart your interests will never be neglected.  Here you can have coolest Bosses who guide you through. They groom you in every possible way and finally when you understand you are Jack Of All Trades and patients and trust in their ways  will also lead you to know your mastery.   I am not sure if any other organization can provide with such an exposure to your work and professional life.   Though I am a part of the training team but since past 2 years I have been associated with many other projects of Lifeline Foundation. No other appraisal is greater than being a part of successful projects and your reporting officers and Head of the company congratulating you in person for each and every successful step.,0.012494627,0.065614305,0.9218911

If you are honest to your work and with your employees they will try and help you in all ways.   You are allowed to stumble make mistakes and learn from them!

"One of the biggest motivations and blessings to me was when the CEO of the company Dr Das took me to give an opportunity to become a trainer in a field that I lacked expertise and most importantly as a fresher.   A little down the memory lane story from my experience. My job expectation was simple from the company: It was to conduct First Aid and CPR training for a collection of audience from various walks of life. To me this was the most difficult job and unfortunately it being the first job itself. So the duties included teaching topics mostly in Hindi and local Gujarati (which I was really bad at both) and English was very minimal to be used (wherein I was very fluent at). Dr Das had his second thoughts on me but I took it up as a challenge and in three months of time I was able to deliver topics (at least if not fluently) but to an understandable extent to the sitting audience who in time I learnt had started to pay attention than earlier. I bought a lot of Hindi novels and local Gujarati dailies to equip my vocabulary to deliver better.  In the next three months Dr Das gave me more training experience and this included panIndia travel and with more exposure came more feedback which we always received from the audience to rate the trainers. My ratings grew from pathetic to satisfactory and at times exceptional and Dr Das was happy.  I was promoted to a Training Officer. My duties in in the job now didn't stop just there I was also given additional roles and responsibilities wherein I used to conduct Paramedic interviews for our OHC staff and train them initially; further do B2C marketing for societies to sensitize the awareness in learning CPR and First aid; to handle the keys of the cabinet as an Admin Rep and manage them between training periods. Overall this role not only gave me a widespread and  an overexposure of opportunities in cultivating interpersonal skills but also the art of talking briskly lucidly fluently and with reason to the public; befriending strangers on the first call or first meet; taking more and more responsibilities within a short span of time based on your abilities; maintaining business etiquette while meeting top management Clients and living together as a family as the staff count was very small.   Today when I see myself from the career evolution perspective I can handle any kind of responsibility or pressure thrown at me at any organisational or hierarchical level because I rose from scratch to top in just 9 months which takes people at least between 2 to 5 years to understand the wisdom every job has to offer elsewhere. Trust me had I wanted to take the above as a gripe or complaint I would have stuffed it in the CONS section. I wouldn't shun the fact that it was too much to handle at times because of the consumption of work but at the end of the training you feel satisfied and relieved having borne responsibilities and sacrifices.   Dr Das brought a lifechanging moment that I won't forget in my life ever when I told him that I was taking a lot in my plate: ""If every person were to think too much of their work and life balance and say I did this and that to come here we would get whiners everywhere all the time! That's how Amitabh Bachan and Shah Rukh Khan were made in the first place compared to thousands of thousands who wanted their big breaks but couldn't make it!""",0.9849771,0.014690273,0.00033265114
"If you think there are cons! Trust me you won't be able to work or adjust anywhere. The strongest of CONS is its strongest PROS! If you've the mindset of a person who's ready to take any amount of loadwork to better your career and future so that you don't go through similar situations time again like a loop in your life you can go for this Org else DON'T! Sometimes we need to understand the often forgotten fact that people are made for jobs too! I'm thoroughly happy that this become my first job and in fact a noble job. Because who gets to tell people ""Hey you've the ability and authority to save a life when there is a need"" ? (And if you think this is a hype review trust me no one paid for me I wrote this out of sheer diligence and gratitude to the founding institution where one recognizes if they are really built up to become strong or whine and become weak!)  Also please don't go by bad comments that say it's a terrible place to work or calling Dr Das foul words. It's a highpressure work environment I guarantee that and involves too many responsibilities that will only benefit and shape a person's career as they go up the ladder. Every other Org does that too! The Man is a Legend.   In my defense I personally had to quit the firm because I had a passion to write and I couldn't find ample time to research and write.",0.66315037,0.33298847,0.0038611742

1)The kids. They make your life filled with more joy.  2)The teaching to kids. Helps you learn about student psychology and understand how difficult it is to be a teacher.,0.0026288219,0.005818355,0.99155277
1) More Talking. Less Action. People at MAD Coimbatore come to chill out with their friends not to teach.  2) There will be a lot of city circles and centre circles just for fun sake. Imagine the kids in shelter homes. 2 hours of class with them. 68 hours a week for chilling out and socialising with fellow volunteers 3) Partiality and Favoritism. They look down on volunteers who come from middle class. They think everyone who doesnt come in a car to teach classes are beneath them. 4) No procedure is ever followed. Lesson plans or session status or attendance is not taken properly. Classes get cancelled all the time. But if you miss a single class all hell breaks loose. 5) Dream Camps are only for their favorite volunteers. Others should pay to get a seat. 6) They only want u for their CFR that is to collect money from people for MAD. Other than that an average volunteer wont even receive a proper certificate if his centre head decides not to.,0.9978357,0.0019227935,0.00024150258
I have served MAD in different capacities at different roles and I must say that If you want to work at a place where you want personal and professional satisfaction then this is the place to be. You will see yourself growing! You will make friends for life! You will develop skills which will stay with you forever.,0.0031414237,0.53653353,0.460325
Though this was not the downside for me but it might be for few. If you are not a full time employee you are a volunteer and you don't get paid for your work. But you get lots of satisfaction and no amount of money can replace it.,0.9454974,0.053875778,0.00062673894
1) Happiness which we get by helping the kids at shelter homes(interacting and teaching them is actually fun unlike what we experienced in our schools) 2) Great experience and exposure which will help in future 2) All the fun activities happening throughout the year 3) Dream camps(only heard of it as I am new),0.00025881044,0.000349326,0.9993918

Certificate Networking  Socializing  They have built a good culture which helps in regularity and continuation. Chance to work with children  they are the best part of this experience. Several MAD Volunteers have done great in helping the children. My criticism is directed towards management.,0.00046310652,0.0022543913,0.9972825
No Innovation TopDown Approach. Only directors instructions are to be followed. Volunteers are not empowered/allowed to create and deploy solutions on the city level. Very less scope of any good work in online mode. Fake enthusiasm false positivity which deflects people's attention from pressing issues.  No accountability; Frequently changing plans  Delay in starting operations.  Too many zoom calls  Fellows and Volunteers have been complaining about the pointless zoom meetings but nothing changes. Too much focus on branding selfpromotion.  It's shameful how MAD is spending so much time during the pandemic organisational overhaul and selfappraisal. The core volunteer model of MAD has changed without a feasible explanation.,0.99869055,0.001131787,0.00017765757
Cause connectedness and the volunteering model,0.00017981729,0.00048252576,0.9993376
Fake culture and appreciation all the time.  No space for creativity.  No team trust especially if for the benefit of the organisation if some people play devil's advocate they are viewed as problem creators.  It's an org run by an incompetent CEO and Best frnds of the CEO Bad funder management Misuse of donated money. Volunteers manipulated to raise funds by pushing the emotional angle of helping children,0.9990113,0.0008287427,0.00015992436
MAD is one of the best places to work at because it gives you a lot of exposure and in the process you really get to know yourself so much better. Spending time doing justice to the society gives a level of satisfaction and happiness. MAD gives a very good platform to develop communication skills teaching skills and personality development.,0.00023738701,0.00025200142,0.99951065

1. Good place to learn for health care newly pass outs since medical professionals need to practice and there are enough opportunities to do that since it is a big hospital. but only for new comers since 1 year is good time to get frustrated in the system and you can find employees talking that all time. 2. Good learning experience in multi specialty since there are seniors who can give learning but yes slogging is a part of new joiners. basically slogging goes from senior to specialty head. rest it is liking face or base by head. 3. Good experience count in future since it is one of the biggest hospital technically value add for freshers or experienced employees in health care sector only. 4. Fine job for localities in support functions since they can balance their personal (family life) its more of boss management then work.,0.0073314644,0.16849628,0.82417226
1. It is like a multi government hospitals running under one roof without reference you can't get your work done being an employee then forget the outsider. 2. Typical old system and practices for support function without any senior experienced management or guidance projects keep getting started and never gets completed lack of decision making at CEO COO level. 3. Typical single owner (lala) company all decisions for employees are based on face value and employee close to authorities and exceptions can be made for them however no value for a common employee at times you can feel like a government setup and to keep following up or trying to get reference in the department for your work to get done (HR IT COO office etc) 4. Keep your knowledge and skill aside boss management you need to learn else you are bottom performer with no job security Boss is happy then your life is set  ;) 5. Only Operations are guided well since MD is highly skilled in it however support functions is totally miss leaded. 6. Career dooming for support function employees since there are not much changes are accepted to not too much to do just paper work and run with no direction to show you are working.  Health care employees can learn rest waste of time and efforts since noone counts it.,0.99886656,0.00097600365,0.00015738192

Exploitative setup and elitist mindset against a poorly paid but talented workforce (science and nonscience too) and their commitment. Management needs to work well on their human resource management. Growing discrimination against postdocs and externally registered JRF. Students and postdocs are no lab managers. It is a waste of their precious time in overstressed but underpaid life as a researcher in India where there is little time to do research and grow. Don't throw gibberish such as training them in lab management as an excuse for this exploitation. If your regulations do not allow it in India get one. Lab management is not a student burden but faculty's responsibility and if not institute's responsibility. You are smart enough to fiddle with a problem to find solutions as you train your researchers. So you can find solutions if sincere intent is there as you do for inconveniences to elitist faculty.,0.99835026,0.0014620052,0.00018784248

Beautiful work culture! Indeed this one factor made me stay with this college despite handsfull of statistically better offers. Work cultural values and practices are great. I have been working here as adjunct faculty for a period of three years. I have worked in Universities in India Europe and Middle East; never in my experience I have seen such respectful attitude towards EVERYBODY in the organization. There is almost no hierarchy a flat organization with close knit working relationships. The icing on the cake is that it’s nonreligious and apolitical unlike most of the education institutions in India. Good pay structure.,0.00043049344,0.0006699773,0.99889946

HR at first is dormant verbal complaints they wont entertain. Written complaint they will try to suppress. If you wont back down they will make a case and sack you. HR in India can threaten be rude and can build a case against you in record time to save the person at the top who might be wrong.

– Offhand treatment of employees – Inability to value and reward talent – Rampant inefficiency – Poor decisionmaking at the uppermanagement level and among business stakeholders – Slow to transform and adapt to changes both in terms of operations and products   Let me elaborate.    Recently under the pretext of business/financial crisis as a result of COVID19 the organization laid off several employees. But at the same time they've had the audacity to expect some of the same employees to do the same work as vendors. Basically it appears that they want people to work for them without giving the reward and recognition these people rightfully deserve in exchange. They want to stay on the 'gaining' side while the people who work for them get the shorter end of the stick. It just goes to show how little they value their employees especially the ones in junior and midlevel roles. On the one hand toxic and/or incompetent people somehow get to secure their positions and even rise in the ranks. On the other hand trustworthy and competent people who break their backs to secure good business deals or handover projects on time either quit out of frustration at the many issues and injustices around them or are told to leave.   The organization expects its employees to 'upskill' themselves (like any modern organization rightfully should) but it doesn't give everyone the equal opportunities or means to do so. For instance the organization has a tieup with LinkedIn Learning whereby regular employees have free and unlimited access to the platform but contractual employees don't have the same access. Contractual employees are expected to deliver the same level of performance and quality of work as any regular employee so it's unfair that they aren't given the same means to learn and grow. Maybe at least help them with alternative means? But no zero assistance. Secondly the equipment (namely laptops) provided to the employees are of a poor quality and only hinder work as they're prone to frequent malfunctions. There's also a poor IT support in place where it takes forever to get anything done or fixed. How can anyone be expected to work and deliver results on time when they don't have the proper equipment or resources to work with?   The uppermanagement and HR are inefficient and subpar at communication. There were multiple occasions where I approached HR for certain things but they didn't even acknowledge my emails let alone addressing them. On a few occasions they responded only after I followed up and reminded them. There's another instance where there was a sudden change in the rules regarding access to a certain something. But this change in rules was communicated neither to the employees involved nor their manager(s) and in the end the manager(s) was/were reprimanded even though it was no fault of theirs. The change in rules wasn't communicated beforehand so how could anyone have known?   The business stakeholders are indecisive and laidback when it comes to important decisions. Good deals are brought in but they get shelved due to inaction or delayed action on the part of the stakeholders. In general it appears that most people here don't have any clarity on what to do and how to get it done. A project is given a goahead and you're expected to work at a breakneck speed and deliver within an unreasonable deadline but just as you're halfway through your assignment or have completed it the project gets shelved all of a sudden due to some vague reason. And this happens not once or twice but repeatedly so it's like a cycle where you put your effort into something but never see it through to the end which leaves you dissatisfied and makes you wonder what your purpose here even is. In more practical terms what this means is you can't claim such projects as a part of your work experience on your CV or in an interview as they don't exist as finished products in the market and company policy bars you from revealing info on anything that hasn't been published.   For all its lofty claims about growing and adapting the organization is in fact super slow to evolve and adapt to changes. Until COVID19 hit and everyone was forced by circumstances to be exclusively reliant on virtual/digital services there were many processes that were dependent on outdated paperwork despite the organization's policy of 'reducing paper use' (the irony!) It's only due to the pandemic and the WFH situation that some of these processes went virtual and that too took weeks for the implementers to 'figure out' how to go about it. Why were we handing over hard copies of invoices proposal forms and the like in the first place when the whole thing could've been easily done online? And this is only one of the many examples. On the business side the organization has repeatedly squandered opportunities for establishing a solid digital presence in the market – even in the current scenario where demand for digital products has been on the rise. This is again tied to the previous point about indecisiveness of the business stakeholders.,0.99877065,0.0010554957,0.00017385342

"They have introduced a ridiculous employee band system called the Global Job Classification which in India at least looks super demoralising. Although the GJC is meant to classify roles as support IC manager or executive and across levels 1 to 12 it also has salary bands that are wider than the nation. Their yearly salary revisions ""based on performance"" are barely costofliving/inflation adjustments. The only way to move from one band to another is to leave the company join a competitor and come back at a higher band. I have seen people who have stayed for half a decade or more with no change in bands. I have seen people who have been offered a promotion with no change in bands or salary revision. There is no promotion of learning or inclusivity no culture of feedback. I was starved for intellectual conversation during my years there. In the Noida office there must've been anywhere between 200 and 300 employees walking in and out of the office  yet I had only been introduced to a handful and those only because I needed to work with them. Over time I began smiling at people randomly and introducing myself and asking people questions and maybe got to know 20 more people. People work in silos. Nobody knows what the hell anybody else is working on. Zero crossdepartmental talk. And so many issues with the products there  don't get me started  ""quality"" is a value of theirs  what a joke! To be fair products outside India seem to be fine so does their team that sits outside India. However they couldn't care less about India and the products that are made and sold here. Many departments here are not just incompetent but also lack integrity. And worst of all everyone has to individually email the admin team to book meeting rooms  I'm sorry which century are you still in? Just automate the whole process already. There is a whole lot of politics and asslicking here not to mention the rampant gossiping. Worst of all is there are some good people and good voices but they get lost and these people too often leave in search of better pastures.",0.99765587,0.0020736137,0.00027045177

The management is slacking possibly due to the massive unchecked growth of the organization in the last few years. There is prevalent culture of favoritism. Few managers and directors in senior positions hold the key to senior most management. This can be frustrating for midlevel employees. You have to either submit to it and imitate others (suck up to managers) or prepare to be completely sidelined. There is no formal method followed for promotions and performancebased salary hike. If the your supervisor likes you  great! Or else be happy with the average 12%. As its said  No good deed goes unnoticed. Doesn't apply to PHFI. Don't try to be honest and in love with your work and expect that it will be rewarded. Also there is ridiculously competitive environment when it comes to scientific paper writing.

"""Reflecting on my time at my previous organization I must emphasize that the overall culture of working was the worst I have ever experienced. From the moment I joined it became evident that the organization lacked a supportive and nurturing environment for its employees. There was a pervasive atmosphere of negativity with little to no respect or appreciation shown towards the staff. The management's behaviour was consistently dismissive and unsupportive fostering an environment of fear and insecurity rather than fostering professional growth.",0.99893504,0.0009176828,0.0001473087
During my 4 year tenure at Poornima University I encountered a highly toxic working environment where the management displayed a complete lack of support and respect for the longstanding employees. Their unsupportive nature and disregard for the older employees were evident throughout my time there. I was constantly subjected to the threat of termination as if there were no job opportunities available elsewhere in the market. This fearinducing tactic employed by the management created an atmosphere of insecurity and uncertainty among the employees. Furthermore the institution exhibited a clear lack of belief in employee growth and development opting instead to exploit their staff through compulsion rather than motivation. There was an absence of any form of encouragement or recognition for the hard work and dedication I put into my role making my fouryear journey with Poornima University feel akin to being confined within a jail. One incident that garnered significant attention within the city was the mass firing of over 100 employees during the Covid19 pandemic which was executed through a single order. This display of power and disregard for the wellbeing and livelihoods of the affected individuals and their families highlights the inflated ego of the management as they prioritized their own needs above those of their employees. Despite feeling disheartened by my experience I am now filled with a sense of relief as I look forward to what lies ahead. I am confident that whatever awaits me in the future will be far better than the last four years I spent at this university. I strongly caution others against becoming involved with such a lowvalue institution where employees are treated as mere laborers and their wellbeing is disregarded. It is worth noting that the institution's admission process relies heavily on consultants raising concerns about their moral values and ethical standards. The management's focus on quantity over quality is a recurring theme as they prioritize admission numbers above the actual performance and qualifications of prospective students. This approach undermines the integrity and reputation of the institution further highlighting their disregard for quality education. In conclusion my review of Poornima University paints a bleak picture of a working environment marred by toxic management practices a lack of respect for employees and an obsession with quantity over quality. It is my hope that this review serves as a warning to others allowing them to make informed decisions when considering their association with this institution.,0.99891293,0.0009304589,0.00015657823

My feedback is pertinent to the India platform. t is very open . No hierarchies.

I have 8 years of experience in IT industry and in most of the cases I only see employees leaving companies just because of managers same has happened with me.My review is completely limited to IT infrastructure.some of my colleagues from other domains (Development) told me their manage is good to them. If you are joining this company Don’t even try to talk about issues here you will be a target with Apple on your head.1.I got Access to final tool After about a year. Which is a great achievement for me and company.2. According to my manager there is no limit for Proactiveness.3.No process at all they have mixed SIX sigma ITIL and Agile process frame works and created a new process framework which can be changed any time according to manager.4. Management always blame employees.5.They use Lot of fancy English and talk a lot about big game (AI Argumentedreality for IT infrastructure to troubleshoot and build solutions) but reality is very different (they don’t even have access to their infrastructure. They even don’t know which team is managing which service.) 6. Opinion of counterpart coworkers:  Because of us they are losing their jobs so don’t even expect respect and reply from them. 7. skill set need for this company or to survive there.a. Fancy English you should be able to talk about same point for 30 min.b. you should be expert in steeling colleagues’ projects and credit for their work.8. This is an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) company that means they basically don’t have any Asserts here in India.Obviously no bank will give a loan to nonlisted or LLP companies.,0.9473824,0.050574183,0.0020433867

Learn how playing outdoors in nature can benefit your children intellectually socially emotionally and physically and discover activities for fostering their development. Most of us spent ample time in nature as children climbing trees exploring rocks and bugs or even just playing games outdoors with friends. Little did we know that these fun activities were actually building our brains bodies and characters for later life. Today ample research has shown that nature exposure has numerous longterm benefits.,0.00041633254,0.0027041547,0.9968796
Vulnerable to cognitive biases. Cognitive biases are common patterns of thinking that have been demonstrated to lead to errors in judgment and poor decision making. Unfortunately the same simplicity that makes a prosandcons list so appealing creates many opportunities for a host of cognitive biases to emerge including:Framing effect. Prosandcons lists generally are about evaluating two alternatives: a “thumbs up or thumbs down” scenario and an example of “narrow framing” a bias created by overly constraining the set of possible outcomes.Overconfidence effect. A wellestablished cognitive bias is the tendency of individuals to overestimate the reliability of their judgments. When creating a prosandcons lists it is likely that many people assume a level of accuracy in their assessment of pros and cons that simply isn’t there.Illusion of control. When faced with the task of envisioning possible outcomes a common bias is to believe that one can control outcomes that in reality are not controllable.,0.9935383,0.0061016534,0.00036004558

Nothingwe as a team seen a collection of 2.5 crore by start of 2021 but still management says we are in loss by previous mgt.if previous mgt not managing fund in well pattern then what kind of auditing doing by rustomjee team. In 2019 we seen 0 salary for 4 months which is done by unethical way as well as in 2021 new mgt take decision to shift permanant people on contract with 30% salary deduction. And worst thing not stop over here out of 70% only 30% salary will be creadited in your acct and remaining part will be creadited after a quarter depending on revenue that means person who had min 35k salary will get only 7k in acct. How your employee will survive in city like mumbai. and if your leaving organisation then for fnf god will help you because your pending salaries not credited to you even after 6 months.There are centre managers over here who got more than 100% increment in 2018 year apprisals but others will not get single digit. Maybe mgt thnks only centre manager works on that year others are not working therefore centre may get more than 500 students,0.9983956,0.0014720059,0.00013235134

I joined Salaam Bombay Foundation in September 2017. The work culture at SBF has been a pleasant change from my past frustrating work culture experiences.  At SBF I experienced excellent work culture. Here employees are treated as human beings and not like machines. The HR team here not only facilitates employees' professional growth but also takes care of their emotional & overall wellbeing. Our organisation staff work as one Family & the Leadership team is also very kind in nature and team members can freely share thier ideas with the leadership team even as one can freely talk about one's personal issues with them. High level of confidentiality is maintained and leaders provide guidance as much as possible.,0.00047298483,0.0009301415,0.99859685

"Run by a group of uneducated ignorant illeterate unprofessional and unaware women masquerading as the organisation vice presidents. No sense of professional inclusiveness and no creative independence. Limited world view with the tendancy to follow ""we are always right and the world sucks"" attitude. This organisation claims to follow ""industry standards"" in renumeration but follows a huge disparity. Its highest paid GM gets Rs. 150000 per month and the lowest paid GM gets Rs. 77000 per month. This organisation offers nothing but a maximum of 10% and an average of 34% salary hike annually. There is no bonus or overtime involved. They absolutely disregard labour laws and have no active anti sexual harassment policy. The so called ""Senior Team"" is always busy in gossip mongering and unprofessional conduct and meeting agendas revolve around evening dinners and menus.",0.99892944,0.0009067066,0.00016381181

Newcomers especially Management Trainees in India leaves so early once they joined as they find it is highly difficult to work with Village Directors in projects who are extreme in politics. (More than 50% young employees resign within one year of their term in India (can find the same data from Annual report of SOS India itself) because they feel humiliated by Village Directors.  Moral Policing and Politics are widely placed by Village Directors in almost all the projects in India  make low employee retention rate. (Can verify from the statitics).  SOS India keeps the benchmarking for their quality with Government Shelter Homes in India so that they are always best!   Physical Verbal Emotional abuse and negligence towards children by coworkers and caregivers are a common thing which has been beautifully hidden. Stay in an SOS India village for one month like a normal employee or directly talk with children/youth you will come to know the same. ( I challenge!)   The Job looks like a typical bureaucratic one in Indian setting (if you enter once whether you work or not you can be there for 58 years) with the extreme low opportunity to learn.  Though they have a policy for Innovation the fate of your innovation and creativity will be always in dustbin!  Really unprofessional by Indian scenario.

There is no effort to recognize and encourage staff who really work hard. Other places motivate their employees by giving the best employee of the month award but here it's only negative feedback even after you give your blood n sweat.  Newcomers are treated with bias. Senior staff can take leave whenever they want and make mistakes in office/lab; they also happily get away with it. Junior staffs always have to work on holidays without compensation off. If you ask for compensation off they will ask you the reason (which is unethical). If you do 50 things right (no one will acknowledge it and praise) but if you make 1 tiny mistake they will keep a meeting and create a huge issue as if they themselves are very perfect. Promotions are never given and payments are low as compared to your qualifications and experience. It is a charity institute so they don't pay much. Being a catholic institute they fail to keep their catholic staff safe from bias and corrupt employees. Request for new types of equipment to start a new protocol/test is always turned down. They don't want to grow in terms of technology. Staff grievances are never dealt with and never encouraged. A person can still be in a junior post here even after 20 years of work experience. It's not worth the sacrifice. Appraisal letters are kept secret and never shown nothing is transparent in the management system. There are people who lack proper communication and teamwork skills. They scream and shout in the office as if it was their kitchen and they even overpower HODs.  It's not a professional and healthy environment to work at. Some departments lack staff but the management overloads them with work instead of recruiting more staff. Some rules are totally absurd like working on a holiday without being given compensation off or holiday bonus.,0.99892956,0.00090438017,0.00016597706

"My years of experience at Sushant ( prev ansal university) can best be described as a game of musical chairs i saw being played where people keep going and coming. In just a few years here i have seen so many VCs Registrars Head HRs CFOs and too many Sales and Marketing staff so the person keeps changing but chair is same. They are changed faster than the ""New"" courses the university starts and ends. With so much attrition and firings that happens its no surprise there is lack of a culture and vision in the organization. Since i will keep this neutral to my experience in the Admission department here is what i experienced and saw:1. No appraisal done since years so if you wanna spend a year or 1.5 year its ok. Growth here is like ache din which havent yet come and unlikely to ever.2. No motivation and team building done. No B'days Diwali celebrated or employee trips done. 3. Lack of authority in the admission department where decisions on marketing are taken by academic background people who are registrars/VCs/Dean of the university who dont understand how marketing works. 4. University infrastructure is below average although it was once good due to no maintainence done. There was a fire that happened here (google it) and for atleast a year till i worked here the burnt building section behind reception has remained same with no repair. 5. Usually people leave by 5pm which leaves you with some time for personal work.6. If you are a non teaching staff you will always be kept at a lower level than teaching. The teachrs can take leaves holidays while rest have to report on most holidays.7. The goal of the university management is to get enough admissions so university can be sold off to the highest bidder as its in a prime location although the name is bad in market. This unfortunately hasnt happened since past 7 years. 8. Delayed salaries are a given(sometimes months). 9. Lack of ANY training for non academic staff. Even the sales team is pretty untrained.10. Due to bad practices done it has a poor name in market so sales are hard. The student crowd is the usual scorpio owning gurgaon boys. There are good students too but they are outnumbered.",0.9980075,0.0018012355,0.0001913036

Although some might argue that there are a lot of overlaps between the two fields of Academics and Politics still if you want to build a career in Academics without getting into politics then this place is not for you. You need to be in bed with management or HOD to get less lectures/classes with small no of students and hence less workload less or no invigilation duties leading to better appraisals.  There is a lot of old female faculty members with dubious qualifications who frankly cant get any other teaching job and thus create a hierarchy that suits them well. Caring only about number of admissions Mrs Ansal (Apparently a graduate from correspondence studies and little regards for education quality) runs the University with a dummy VC. The faculty is judged by their marketing efforts (read lying to unsuspecting kids and parents). The old faculty members head these exercises putting all the dirty work on new faculty.  Come here only if you are desperate for a job and run as soon as you find a better one. Your chances of surviving or maybe thriving are better if you come prepared to play dirty politics.,0.9975732,0.0022734376,0.00015341636

Joining the Teach For India Fellowship has been the most rewarding experience of my life. I joined the Fellowship right out of college and had fears about whether spending two of my years in the social impact space would be worth it. I got the answer to this when I attended the national residential training in Pune where I got to meet so many likeminded individuals coming from the best universities across India who are passionate about social impact. When I finally joined my city and got to meet my children I understood there was a lot to be done and the path was laid out for me. It was challenging but with the constant support of my PM co fellows and staff I have been able to take my kids on a transformational journey. However small may be the impact I know at the end of the day I know it's created by my efforts. Lastly Teach For India community has ensured to make it a workplace filled with love and joy which acts as a catalyst to the work I do everyday.,0.0013704937,0.013020857,0.98560864

Before I write this section I would like to give a Trigger Warning as it contains mentions of harassment I joined the fellowship last year (2022) but unfortunately I had to leave the fellowship before completing one year because of the lack of support from the organization and their extremely insensitive behaviour. I was harassed within the school premises of the school I was placed in but no action was taken by the organization despite multiple complaints by me. I informed the respective authorities as soon as possible but not even once did anyone from the organization visited the school and addressed it with the authorities in person. Instead I was made to recall the traumatic incident multiple times over Zoom meetings which triggered my mental health to the point I fell sick and had to take a career gap for months. Apart from this we (me and other fellows) were disrespected and humiliated by the school authorities every single day and whenever we raised the issue the organization replied that they will talk and hold a meeting but it was all futile. Instead the organization always sided with the school authorities and agreed to the unrealistic demands made by them (doing administrative work of nonTFI section as well in addition to the usual teaching and organization work) despite our complaints. My experience at Teach For India has been really terrible and I sincerely do not wish any other fellow in future to have the same experience that I had. Therefore before you join the fellowship I would suggest you talk to other fellows as well know their experience and then make your decision instead of just believing TFI’s “compassion collaborative communication’ narrative”. I wish you all the best in all your future endeavours and I hope you don’t make any decision that you regret later.,0.99833304,0.0015232431,0.00014370977

The Fellowship is a collaborative space with support provided at every step from the dedicated City and National teams of Teach For India. The support from the Program Managers and the continuous conversations with them on one's journey as a leader is exceptional and vital.

Professionally my experience with Teach For India has been invaluable. Through my fellowship I have been able to gain a deep understanding of the Indian education system as well as the social and economic factors that affect it. I have been able to develop and implement lesson plans that cater to the unique needs of my students while also working to improve their critical thinking and problemsolving skills. Additionally I have been able to work with other Teach For India fellows sharing ideas and strategies to help improve education across the country. Overall my experience with Teach For India has been incredibly rewarding both personally and professionally. Through my work as a fellow I have been able to make a real difference in the lives of my students while also gaining valuable skills and experiences that will serve me well in my future endeavors.

And for external hiring the organizations which participate are only for curriculum designing content few teaching jobs(very less).

The work that Teach For India does is without a doubt important and definitely does make a difference. As a fellow I was able to witness the impact I made on my students first hand. I have also heard that the teams in Delhi and other cities have been incredible.,0.00059197174,0.002961855,0.9964462
The staff and organisation themselves are incredibly frustrating. Over my two years with TFIPune  my managers were nonexistent and  my teams both years received very little support despite being in very sensitive schools with a huge lack of resources (even in regards to the average that TFI schools have).  The organisation also has a tendency to focus resources and people on schools that are performing well such as private or Iteach and Akanksha schools  these schools usually already have outside assistance from other organisations and also have students coming in from better supported and less poor families. PMC schools are essentially ignored and their fellows often blamed when the situations there don't work out despite being given next to no support.,0.99874854,0.0011095913,0.00014182493
Teach For India (TFI) gives you a lot of support for the work you do. They have a steep learning curve as an organization and are continuously upping their game to provide support for Fellows who are pursuing the Fellowship. They believe in collaborative action and have created an environment of many to many rather than one to one or one to many. There's always someone helping you at TFI. They provide space for developing many competencies  leadership is one of the most important ones. They also have continuous sessions to help Fellows figure out what they want to do after the Fellowship.,0.010348004,0.008926086,0.98072594
Sometimes there is a blurred line between professional and personal and this can become confusing for some employees. Also their training period lasts only for a month and one feels a little under prepared to walk into a low income classroom and community.,0.9986292,0.0012120183,0.00015880997

Managers keep taking out ever drop of blood from you unnecessary emotional pressure to spend more time working with them. By them I do not mean students but working with your peers and sharing your life history.  Don't join this place because you do not have any other option. Think more. Only join if you think this is all you can achieve and is your dream. If the goal is to be successful and make a bigger difference this is not something you should choose.,0.99792874,0.0019075567,0.00016373296
A character building assignment where one understands how to manage time self and others in an environment that is completely new to them. Very good outreach idea and a smart business plan. At the end of the two years fellows learn patience and relationship building.,0.00022040709,0.00042594233,0.9993537
Program Managers. At least in the city that I worked in program managers tend to think they are Gods. Their condescending and patronizing attitude is very difficult to deal with. They are not broad minded enough to take any feedback and believe that being a program manager makes them something special. They have formed a mini sorority within themselves and do not allow people to join them if they don't like them. And what is the cause for not liking them personal issues and biases. Have never seen greater hypocrisy!,0.9984383,0.0013818378,0.00017983888
Fantastic. Transformational. You won't get such breadth and depth of responsibility in an other organisation at this age of 21 and experience anywhere else.

Work Life balance is known to be slightly harder. But that's really something you need to figure out for yourself. Especially since TFI has a flexible work culture which means you don't have to clock hours as long as you get your work done. So really striking that balance is enturely on you.,0.0019389518,0.9963946,0.0016664499
The organizational vision and the opportunity to network with educators in India makes it a great place for people who intend to continue in the educational sector. Each individual has the flexibility to try out classroom activities outside the traditional classroom methodologies that are a common practice across majority of the schools in the country.,0.00020552377,0.00038709026,0.9994074
As an organization Teach For India has a set of goals and methodologies that it expects the fellow to execute in addition to the goals and protocols that the school that the fellow has in place.  Sometimes the extensive lesson planning clinics and sessions that the fellow has to attend outside the classroom hours makes the fellowship rigorous affecting one's work life balance.,0.9953361,0.0045002387,0.00016357722
TFI is the leading nonprofit organisation in India to work for/with/at. The organisation comprises of some of the nicest and kindest people in the industry. TFI allows freedom and autonomy at work (be it for a fellow or a staffer). It actively creates opportunities for its employees to grow as people and leaders of tomorrow. The organisation stays committed to its cause of bridging the ed inequality in India. It also creates an open and safe space (mostly) for people to air their grievances.  (PS: It pays salaries on time.  This may be a basic expectation for many but not all organisations in India are prompt with respect to this!),0.00073666655,0.0009914435,0.9982718
Not sure about this one but a thumb rule (if you're looking to work here) is to do your research and talk to Fellows and staffers before joining the organisation.,0.13381909,0.86564964,0.0005312014

Teach For India claims to be a leadership development program but is a Teacher production machine. If you want to continue in the education sector a great place to start but if you want to shift to another sector especially corporate you will be considered as a fresher.  Sessions are repetitive and as mentioned above revolve around teaching and not on your leadership skills. You expect organizational politics to be nil in the place but to a surprise favoritism plays a huge role if you choose to make a career inside TFI,0.98545516,0.01383298,0.00071189244
Have been a Fellow and presently a staff. The organization is trying to solve a very pressing issue and motivation levels are high. You get some great colleagues to work with.

Due to lack of impact measurement it can be disillusioning at times  you don't even know what you are working towards. The average workforce is very young and the organization takes pride in it but the immaturity shows  in terms of policies structures and workflow.Nepotism and favouritism is rampant.,0.99902797,0.0007959459,0.00017615929

Most fellows come in with strong ideas of what education should look like. However management makes fellows execute their own vision with a very narrow field of flexibility. This makes the job feel monotonous and robotic.  Management manipulates people into overworking themselves. They exploit fellows' commitment to their job.,0.9982838,0.0015358876,0.0001802449

1.People.People.People. i.e the Fellows and Staff at Teach For India. Their energy passion and motivation towards the cause inspires one to face the challenges of ending the educational inequity problem in the face. Every day.This teamspirit is so crucial in successful organisations.Being a young organisation Teach For India is working hard on getting this right.  2. Life lessons and learning in classroom: Taking up the responsibilities of teaching 40 children who enter the school with all odds stacked up against them is a very transformational experience. Without any doubt this experience pushes one to the brink stretches you beyond the limit and immerses you in the daily life of low income communities. But by working hard one day at a time one child at a time we can show that change is indeed possible. In my experience I have gone through so much positive changes and have learnt to value people and life.  3. Opportunities to network with the best educators and social sector leaders.  4. Living and being the change as Gandhiji put it. This fellowship is built on the core values that ll help the Fellow be a transformational teacher and thus be that person who will help the children break the cycle of poverty.,0.0020486058,0.007827536,0.9901239
1.Since this is a young organisation some systems and processes may still be evolving or not yet in place. (For those who love taking initiatives these are opportunities) 2. The pay might be just enough to live by and expense reimbursement might not cover all the expenses incurred in the classroom. (in this case most fellows raise funds from friends and their network),0.9927148,0.007099053,0.0001861443
You get a lot of responsibility right away by your second year you'll start managing others and even be responsible for key aspects of an important project. Stay 2 years and you'll be a manager with a lot of responsibility and direct interaction with lots of different teams. The work is engaging  challenging and the people are really great. There's a lot of purpose if your motivated to change things you'll see that happen from the things that you do here.,0.015942076,0.52972895,0.45432898
It's a great place for young people but it tends to get rough on those with families. A good number of staff are always on the road or travelling. There's little downtimeand that's often commandeered for things not in your job description. Let me add that it will be tough to live on what you're paid here and even though you might not be focused on that it definitely will hurt. You will have to forgo nice things for a while. TFI is the professional's NGO so there's a lot of things that an MBA would recognize or indeed someone from a corporate job. There's also a lot of other stuff which i'll put under faith you can't touch it or measure it but you believe that it works or that it will work out. If you were the kid in school who told everyone Santa Claus is not real you may have a tough time here.,0.7276167,0.27016446,0.0022188453

Fellowship program is one of best opportunities for developing as an individual and metamorph into a leader. The program exposes you to India's most pressing problem of education inequity and grooms you into a lifelong leader. To be honest the program demands a lot more than just commitment.But at the end of the day one feels it was one of the best choices of joining the fellowship.,0.0012045562,0.00397348,0.9948219

1) Kids. Working with them will bring you joy. BUT you don't have to join this place to do so either. You can volunteer or work on your own.  2) Grassroots level experience.  3) You will start empathizing with our teaching community and also understand why quality of teachers is bad in our country. Its really a thankless and a bad job here!,0.99213284,0.0071046976,0.0007624838
1) What you see from outside is different from what you get. The Fellowship is only about teaching making report cards tolerating things that you don't like and the trainings are about teaching and 'pushing yourself'.   If you want to be a teacher it is great. If you are here to learn grow as a professional and work in private sector later on then forget about this place. Companies won't even touch you.   2) People are completely unprofessional in staff roles. Many people who join here are smart people but they are treated like kids. Fellows are not respected. The managers are immature bunch of fresh college grads who have only 2 years teaching experience.   3) They do not like feedback. It is completely frustrating because everyone here tries to convince you to buy their nonsense. If you are the kind of a person who wants to make genuine impact work with talented people and bring about a change this is NOT your place.  They are very good with marketing. Please do not get fooled. This will ruin your career. If you think TFI will get you good jobs admissions it will not! Those are only one off cases which are highlighted.   But if you want to be a teacher all your life this is really a good place. Network talk to current staff and fellows before joining these guys. Don't make the mistakes we all made!

From the date of joining I knew Texila is the best place where I wanted to be. I was very impressed with the people I met during the interview process and my respect for the Whole team has increased over time. In my experience what they promise is what they deliver. This is a great learning opportunity as you can reach heights through your learning simultaneously at work.   The opportunity to make a difference each day and contribute to the overall success of the company is deeply rewarding. The people I get to work with are the most enjoyable part of my position.   My position affords me every opportunity to learn and grow professionally while working from my office. It's truly the best company I've had the opportunity to be a part of and I look forward to many years at Texila,0.00025355374,0.00024874846,0.99949765

Of all of my careerer TEMS was my most favorite employer for many earned reasons. The genuine fair and caring atmosphere coupled with the great attitude and teamwork approach made this office a place to look forward to. The university is a diverse workplace and I learned how to multitask to meet university deadlines and be effective in Business Development Roles.  The coworker to coworker relationship is great. Everyone treats one another like family and get along very well. Even though the manager to coworker relationship is not as great as it should be the relationship with coworkers are great,0.00036334325,0.0010074439,0.9986292

I have been with Texila for two years and true to my heart I would say that this is the best place to grow with.  The worklife balance is absolutely good and you are not in a position to compromise your personal agenda for work. This made to stick with Texila management.  Among bloodsucking employers Texila stands out from the crowd and treats the employees as good as possible. You come on time do your work leave on time.

Good place to learn mediocrity how to postpone work and to learn how to basically blabber when u dont have anything to offer  Yes it is international for namesake but if u want to go to the other locations better be based out of those places because the indian team has too much politics and a hierarchical approach that will never help u to go there  International team is good (unfortunately they aren't the people ull deal with during ur day to day job),0.65314615,0.34046912,0.00638475
Indian team is especially badly managed unplanned and directionless The biggest irony is that the person who heads the org ( in 2020) knows it very well but he is least bothered to fix it and if anyone tries to put it to this person he/she will be met with a hostile/ no reply Those who are managers here most of them have no knowledge about conflict resolution and they say a lot about worklife balance but they'll make sure that u work on your holidays as well There are people who only give reasons for results below comittment year on year talk too much than they work their programs have not shown any noteworthy results but they still get away with it its fishy and not worth a serious person's time No career growth whatsoever! Highly unprofessional and absolutely zero work ethic too much lies and to top that there's arrogance and rudeness especially towards those who are at lower levels And the so called leadership team is mostly the culprit They dont have a product or a proper service to offer really All they got is talk and colorful presentations which if one takes a good look at will know that its a big fat zero,0.99890983,0.0009347598,0.00015545337

If you are someone who can keep your mouth shut and not share your opinion about the unhealthy practices in this organization this is a good place to learn about working with schools.   If you can remain low profile you can think of working here as a freelance trainer than a fulltime trainer. This way you will still get to work with different kinds of schools when you work here.,0.012179993,0.6857159,0.3021041
Like in a typical Indian Movie The Director is the hero! If you outshine her as a trainer the Operations and Admin people in this organization will make sure that you feel miserable about working there and eventually leave. The Director will not be directly involved in this harassment. She uses other people to do it for her.  The Director is well connected in education circles. She will use this clout to badmouth you if you cross her the wrong way once you leave this company. During my time as an employee there people used to talk about how she contacted similar organizations not to hire people who worked there when they wanted to leave.  They have no sensible long term marketing strategy in place. As a result you will be pushed to make sales calls even if you are a trainer. They have no concept of using people they have hired for the purpose they have hired them for in the first place.   They do not have a hire and fire policy. If you think it is a good thing you are wrong. They keep the wrong people so that they are loyal and not question the management.  You will not get a decent exit if you want to leave this company. They will play around with your experience and relieving letter. They will try not to give you your experience letter as much as possible especially if you are leaving for a similar organization.  This is the most micromanaged organization you can work for in the Education NGO sector in India. You will feel like there is someone peeping at your computer screen all day. Forget taking initiative and independent decisions about your work if you join this company.  This company is a familyrun business masquerading as an NGO. The Director's family members sit at the top executive and board levels in this NGO. They will create unnecessary issues for you at work if you are vocal about their unhealthy practices.  Their Admin Department has more say in everything than their Operations or Content or Training Department. The Admin Department promotes very trainerunfriendly practices in this company at the behest of the Director. For example getting your travel and stay sorted with the Admin Department is a pain. If you openly voice your concerns about your travel or stay the Admin Department will run a smear campaign against you in the company. There is an HR Department whose only work is organizing 'Secret Santa' in December!  Their talk about inclusion is all a load of baloney. If you come with a degree from a foreign university (Has to be from the USA or UK!) and can keep your mouth shut about what you do not agree with you will be accepted quickly into the fold. They will also poke their nose into your very personal matters and make it a lunch table discussion when you are not around if you are seen as different. Their Admin Department leads this!  There may not be any scope for you to innovate in this company. Innovation is met with scorn unless it comes directly from the Director herself. Any academic discussion outside of meetings is usually made fun of by the seniors especially their Admin Department. Their training content dates back to their founding days. Much of what they are pushing into the market today is the repackaged versions of their first set of workshops. Or they are ripped off from International Experts. For example their ISELF is a direct rip off of CASEL's Framework. They did a panIndian Survey for a few months and called it research for their SEL framework. Imagine doing research on something as complex as SEL and coming up with a Framework in less than 3 years after getting teachers and students to fill up a few questionnaires  if you can understand why this is wrong you can understand what level of innovation is possible for you in this company.,0.9984939,0.0013544394,0.00015162007

It is saddening however to see how the employees are treated. On an individual level the employees are treated like workers. There is a high level is mistrust and autocracy that goes on where only the director is the face of all the work that happens and any other individuals work is merely a contribution to that.  They HR is rude and is constantly giving new rules to follow to make matters worse they have team viewer installed in all the computers and have someone watching each screen constantly to ensure everyone works.

If you have been working as a professional in the not for profit space and want to pursue work in impact space Women's World Banking is a perfect stepping stone as they recruit expereinced talent.

As a proffesional you are expected to be independent & drive your business verticals. Very little heirarchy; you can make a lot of decisions.

There needs to be better thought through career paths especially for younger team members. There is no defined promotion/ graduation curve which can be very overwhelming if youve worked in more structured organisations.   There is heavier staffing at the NY end comapred to local offices; which adds a layer of cost to operations; with regional teams being understaffed,0.99880064,0.0010374623,0.00016195413

"Indian management is very unclear and tries to stretch people into long working hours. It's a norm here to hear people say ""I will complete that over weekend"". Weekend meetings are not rare.
