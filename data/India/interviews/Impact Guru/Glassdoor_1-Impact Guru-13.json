They started of with HR round, followed by assessment, then the technical round and final one with the \"Founder\" of the company. All the rounds were fine, except the one with the Founder. This so called founder was so full of herself and arrogant. She said and i quote \"While this is a fund raising org, we're also profit making business, and we are not doing social service here. We want people who're flexible and can hustle\". While there is nothing wrong in making profit and like she said they're running a business here. I had to do my bit of research too. Which brought me to glassdoor, to do a research on company work ethics. The total negative review sums up the state of the company. While she did mention they have strict clock-in time, when i asked her about the clock-out time, her reply was \"This is a fast-paced environment and i can't guarantee that\". As an employee who has worked over the years, it's important to realise, this is just business for them and you can be replaced anytime. When i asked her about the Glassdoor reviews, she said \"I don't care what the former employees say about us, you should go look at the Google reviews, the people who left, it was their problem\". This Founder like mentioned in the Glassdoor review is exactly a micromanaging person who like to get involved in tiniest of the matters and acts arrogant if expected equal value and opportunity. If you're thinking of giving an interview here, make sure to go through Glassdoors and make an informed choice.", "Interview Questions": "Q1 - Why do you want to join IG?

There were 4 Basic Excel questions, 4 Pivot table questions,2 Power BI questions and 3 Go to Market questions and this was sent to me at 11:35 and I was surprised how to complete all this before 1. Long story short I could complete all questions by 3:15 including lunch break and waiting outside the office to be called inside. I informed HR Neha about my completion of the assignment she told me 5 mins and there would be an interview after review of the assignment by that time it was already 6 hours. At 4:10 I informed her about my other commitments at 6 and my need to leave by 4:30 at 4:20 I told her that I can't wait anymore. At 4:20 me and another interviewee were relieved by hr and were told that our review will be given by mail or call. My only concern here is if there was a lengthy assignment and the interview was supposed to be based on why not the assignments given before and if they liked it the further process could have been done offline it would have saved so much energy and time for both the parties. The time waste which was done and the misinformation or no information about the time commitment required. After this experience I personally was not going to go ahead with the job because if someone can't respect their commitment and make others wait I don't think I can learn much from them.
