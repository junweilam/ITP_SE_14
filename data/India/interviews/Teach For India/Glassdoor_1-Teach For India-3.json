Else you will be directly called for an assessment centre (AC). AC again has a series of rounds starting with a demo teaching round, where you will be asked to teach a K-5 grade level concept infront of other applicants. You are given 5 minutes to teach. Following that you have a group discussion/group task round. Here your group will be given a situation(could be a an actually school related situation) and the group is expected to come up with a solution. Somebody from the team has to be a moderator, a recorder and a time keeper. Following that you have to take a quantitative and logical ability test (as the fellowship requires lot of data crunching/analysis). Based on your performance in these 3 rounds you may be either asked to stay for the next rounds or asked to leave. The next round is the PI round. It can go on for almost 1 hour. But the interview will make sure you are comfortable.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "15 Oct 2016", "title": "Intern Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Teach For India (Mumbai) in Sept 2012", "Interview Descriptions": "Applied online via their portal, went through two telephonic rounds.
