Unfortunately, I encountered unprofessional work attitudes during both interviews, which left a lasting negative impression. I believe it is crucial to shed light on these experiences to help potential candidates gain a better understanding of the company's interview process and work culture. First Interview: For the first interview, I was called to their office and faced immediate challenges. The interviewers had not reserved a room, leading to a frantic search for an available space. Despite these initial setbacks, I proceeded with the interview, which consisted of general product questions. HR representative suggested that I leave for the day due to the unplanned absence of the second-round interviewer. However, I never received any further communication from HR, even though she had mentioned a second round conducted over Zoom. Although it is possible that I was rejected after the first round, the complete lack of follow-up from the HR representative was unprofessional and disheartening. Second Interview: In the second interview, I successfully cleared two rounds and was assigned a case study for the third round. Following the instructions provided by the Senior Product Manager, I contacted HR to confirm the interview slots. To my surprise, HR informed me that I had not cleared the second round, despite being assigned a case study and asked to prepare. She requested time to confirm the status but subsequently ceased all communication, leaving me without any further information, positive or negative. Overall Impression: Despite Providence's plans to establish their GCC in India and their long-term vision, my experiences with the current staff and interview process have left an overwhelmingly negative impression. I observed a recurring theme of unprofessionalism and lack of communication from the team and staff members I interacted with. As a result, I have concerns regarding the pervasive culture at their Hyderabad office.", "Interview Questions": "General Product and role related - RCM, Analytics etc"}, {"date": "29 Apr 2023", "title": "Security Consultant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "The process took 2 days.\u00a0I interviewed at Providence", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview process was fine and questions was also OK but interviewer was asking to extend shift everyday,That time I decided not to join if there is no respect for personal life", "Interview Questions": "Vulnerability management life cycle an"}, {"date": "12 Apr 2023", "title": "Service Engineer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Providence (Hyder\u0101b\u0101d)", "Interview Descriptions": "The process was quite normal like other companies but the managerial round was tough compared to the technical round.
