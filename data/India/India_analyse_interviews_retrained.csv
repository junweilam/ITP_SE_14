"There were three rounds of interviews (2 written tasks and two interview rounds) and took about two weeks.   The hiring person wants someone who has 6 years of experience but can't offer a salary as per market standard because its the ""Social Sector"".  Before starting an interview one must ask the hiring person to clearly mention the salary package and JD over email because after completing the interview process they have the tendency of changing the salary scale (they will tell you that there is another candidate for hire if you don't accept the low pay)   Also they mention that if work calls one has to work on Saturday or Sunday though it's an off. This is their work culture as they give an option of working remotely (also a reason to deduct your salary from the lovely hiring person).",0.9958205,0.0038104174,0.00036909455

I applied online at the IDinsight office in New Delhi. The process took 2 months.  First Round  Timed Math Assessment: Fairly standard questions of the type generally found on the GRE/GMAT.  Second Round  Case Interview: Was given an impact evaluation case study on the basis on which questions were asked. Unlike in management consulting cases cross questioning is not necessarily required less though solid knowledge of impact evaluation methods is recommended.  Third Round  Personality Interview: Probably the toughest round very probing questions about background motivation and fit.,0.008182294,0.99126035,0.000557338
"The entire process took approximately 3 months  something that was totally preventable and in their control. Allinall I think IDinsight staff is extremely insincere and insensitive about the anxieties that goes through applicants' minds.    The process begins with a detailed form about yourself followed by a math test that lasts about an hour. After that they have two interview rounds. The first interview is more technical  wherein you receive a few case studies that should not be difficult if you know about basic econometrics and RCTs (sampling stratification spillovers). They also ask you to solve two basic algebra questions towards the end as well. The second interview is behavioural and so far the weirdest one where they ask you a bunch of questions that I feel should have no bearing on your candidature. It is also clear that they have not changed their interview process in the fivesix years of their existence. The questions are quite honestly annoying and unsettling.   The interviewers were quite honestly disrespectful and rude. There is hardly any need for these kinds of interviews to be stress interviews  (they are on Skype and also this is not a management position which requires you to test how we respond to stressful situations). The stress interview format does one thing and one thing only: it unsettles and unnerves you reduces your confidence makes you nervous. One of the interviewers argued with me over a statistical technique I use at my work nearly everyday  I am not sure whether it was an interview technique to pry into my behaviour but it reflected badly on them because she was incorrect but almost petulantly insisted that she was correct.  At one point an interviewer asked me about Stata commands I use (totally a wrong format.. the interview is verbal. If you want to test my coding skills take a Stata test?)   The interviewers I noticed were also not at all aware about their own recruitment process but wanted to know what questions I have had (both their answers: ""good question but I am not sure""). At one point one interviewer told me that she was not sure what the entire recruitment process is but she did know how it was three years ago. What should I do with this information and how is it relevant? Shouldn't somebody who is making huge decisions about candidates know what processes they are going through?  IDinsight might think that their processes are standardised but they are not. A colleague of mine who similarly interviewed and ultimately got the offer had a kinder more professional interviewer. If you aren't asking the same questions from all candidates how are you hoping to judge how fit they are to the organisation? My conjecture is also that your previous experience and education has a sheepskin effect for IDinsight. You'll be at a significant advantage if you 1) went to a top school 2) worked for organisations that are universally known.  They also ask for references as a part of the recruitment process. References are a form that your referees fill which are again very weird arbitrary questions that a referee should not reduce their reference to. I also understand that references are a part of an overall 'score' that they ultimately judge you on. References to me although a significant part of the recruitment should not be competitive. I have different referees other candidates have different referees. You cannot compare mine against theirs. It is pointless and unfair. It is also a waste of time if you are not going to recruit most of the people you are asking references from.   I really regret the time and effort that went into a fruitless recruitment process. Honestly I would be upset at the lengthy circuitous process it took had I received the offer. It also is terribly upsetting to know from an insider that there isn't much deliberation in the recruitment process either  just some matching of scores from each round. It should not take three months.",0.9972927,0.0025537703,0.00015344842

First there is a basic application on the website followed by a math test and then several interviews.  I gave the first interview about a month after submitting the application. It was mostly a case study interview which went smoothly. In the end there were a few quantitative questions that I couldn't do in a very impressive time span.  I respect IDinsight's rigorous process to hire but wish they granted some respect to people who are applying to the organisation. I had to wait nearly two months to be told that I got rejected. The mail was insincere and had no reasons given as to why they made me wait that long.,0.974501,0.024713332,0.0007856328
First round interview consisted of two parts: behavioral and applied. The behavioral was relatively straightforward mostly about who you are and why you're interested in the position. The applied portion was essentially a case on how you would set up a RCT (between options given discuss what is better and why).  I applied for an international position and therefore had a Skype call with the regional office.,0.00045278057,0.99885035,0.00069679494
The process was great. The interviewer was extremely nice and cooperative. Even though I didnt get in she was more than happy to give me advice. The process didnt even last too long,0.006431253,0.54255116,0.4510176
To begin with IDinsight is the most unprofessional and opaque organisation I've come across in years of my professional career. There is no hint of transparency in their selection process and show absolutely no regard for a candidate's engagement and career plans. I applied online for the job. After the CVshortlisting two rounds of interviews were conducted. First was the technical round which dealt with intricacies of RCT through a casestudy. It's necessary that you posses knowledge of econometrics and basic math. The second round was with their India Director. It was a fit interview where they discussed aspects of career interests goals personality and team management. Both interviews lasted about an hour. I cleared both the interview rounds after which they didn't respond for 2 months which was absolutely unexpected from the organization. They retrieved 2 months later to contact my references. A week later they inform me that they can't make an offer right now. I asked for a feedback to which they blatantly refused. I pushed an employee in the organization to push for the same but they were rude to his requests as well (they'd respond only if they have a reason to reject me). It is not difficult to see what happened behind the doors during these two months of delay . Not discrediting the organisation but the utter lack of transparency in the selection process coupled with a bias for a certain kind of brand/background completely defeats all arguments for meritocracy. For their lack of professionalism and bias I'd not recommend anyone apply for this role.,0.9984097,0.0014281486,0.000162264
3 stage interview after which they contact your references before making an offer. In the first interview they asked a few basic quantitative questions and roleplay questions. Though they needed no preparation they did catch me off guard. The second interview was an hour long technical interview where I was asked about my experience with Stata and walked through many levels of a scenario that involved both roleplay and quantitative reasoning. I was even asked what Stata commands I would use to test the validity of a relationship given the experimental context and how I would interpret the coefficient T stat etc. They sent an evaluation methodology table to look over before this interview though simply studying this would not have been enough for a successful interview. I was flown out to Delhi for my final interview where I spoke to a partner for about 2 hours. These questions were all to gauge my fit in the organisation asking questions like what my career plans were in the next 5 yrs and 20 yrs why I am interested in this type of quantitative analysis what makes me think I am well prepared for it how my previous boss would describe me etc.,0.9897189,0.010073843,0.00020733419

"The interview process was good atleast for the first couple of rounds. They started of with HR round followed by assessment then the technical round and final one with the ""Founder"" of the company. All the rounds were fine except the one with the Founder. This so called founder was so full of herself and arrogant. She said and i quote ""While this is a fund raising org we're also profit making business and we are not doing social service here. We want people who're flexible and can hustle"". While there is nothing wrong in making profit and like she said they're running a business here. I had to do my bit of research too. Which brought me to glassdoor to do a research on company work ethics. The total negative review sums up the state of the company. While she did mention they have strict clockin time when i asked her about the clockout time her reply was ""This is a fastpaced environment and i can't guarantee that"". As an employee who has worked over the years it's important to realise this is just business for them and you can be replaced anytime. When i asked her about the Glassdoor reviews she said ""I don't care what the former employees say about us you should go look at the Google reviews the people who left it was their problem"". This Founder like mentioned in the Glassdoor review is exactly a micromanaging person who like to get involved in tiniest of the matters and acts arrogant if expected equal value and opportunity. If you're thinking of giving an interview here make sure to go through Glassdoors and make an informed choice.",0.9198813,0.0795368,0.0005819128

I was called for an offline face 2 face interview and was told that the interview process will be from 11 to 1 and we are expected before 15 mins to 11 I reached at 10:35  I was called for the interview at 11:20 Akshay asked me some basic questions as take me through your CV and then he asked me to show my past work which It took me by shock as I was not prepared for that and as it took me time to search for my past work the interviewer Akshay asked me to do a assignment where Power BI is used. There were 4 Basic Excel questions 4 Pivot table questions2 Power BI questions and 3 Go to Market questions and this was sent to me at 11:35 and I was surprised how to complete all this before 1. Long story short I could complete all questions by 3:15 including lunch break and waiting outside the office to be called inside. I informed HR Neha about my completion of the assignment she told me 5 mins and there would be an interview after review of the assignment by that time it was already 6 hours. At 4:10 I informed her about my other commitments at 6 and my need to leave by 4:30 at 4:20 I told her that I can't wait anymore. At 4:20 me and another interviewee were relieved by hr and were told that our review will be given by mail or call. My only concern here is if there was a lengthy assignment and the interview was supposed to be based on why not the assignments given before and if they liked it the further process could have been done offline it would have saved so much energy and time for both the parties. The time waste which was done and the misinformation or no information about the time commitment required. After this experience I personally was not going to go ahead with the job because if someone can't respect their commitment and make others wait I don't think I can learn much from them.  Also the role demands sometimes extended working hours and work on weekends.,0.9978083,0.0020416,0.00015013754

"Applied through a referral. Preliminary HR interview followed by 3 rounds of interactions with the Senior Manager and 1 round with the Director.  The interview process took over a period of 4 months (July  November 2015) which itself is an indication of no clarity on the process. With regard to professionalism this is the worst organization that I interviewed with ever. They verbally make an offer without anything on paper. Several messages and calls later they keep asking you to ""have patience"" and provide other sanctimonious suggestions such as ""we encourage you to look for other jobs if our offer is delaying you"".   From my understanding they generally hire ISB graduates with no offers from visiting companies during placements. It is a surprise how utterly incapable they will be of holding a job themselves. They can't hold a conversation with integrity  they lie delay things and leave you in muck.  My suggestion Keep Away!",0.9988381,0.0010183459,0.00014363803

June 2012. The panel was completely disinterested in doing its job and it seemed like the decision had been made even before the interview started. Complete lack of courtesy and professionalism on the part of the professor on the panel and the two former students. I did waste significant time and money going to this.

Absolutely a sham of a process super disgusting! Appalled by this firm's lack of clarity ethics communication and vision.  Seems like a family led org changing decisions on the go with top management brought on because of personal friendships rather than relevant experience and skills.   Received a call at 10PM and was told to join the next day. HR ghosted when I asked for time making excuses and changing strategy and vision of the entire company in weeks. I asked questions about the job role but they didnt have clear answers. Send mails at 3AM and attach the wrong job description when you ask them for the responsibilities of the role. Gave the appearance of an unprofessional run out of a basement kind of organization.   They have put up fake reviews on glass door w.r.t the company. Do not join unless you're willing to be disrespected cheated and lied to your face.   Absolutely horrendous experience. Surprised such people exist in the social impact space.   They offered me a role but ghosted and withdrew my offer letter after ghosting me for a month. I reached out respectfully despite sick health and the reason that I was given was 'we found another candidate earlier this week'. By law you're required to inform a candidate as early as possible if you're withdrawing the offer if already offered to someone else. When I expressed my discomfort I was told ' I am sure you were also applying to other firms and not waiting up on us'  Heard terrible stories from ex employees on random pay cuts lack of a voice in the organization.  Really pitiful that Intelehealth exists as such a horrible  women led org in the impact space. Very far from setting an example and changing things.   Disgusted.,0.99888796,0.0009602263,0.00015180248

Of late NUS has become quite stringent in selecting students. However a good undergrad university or a good CGPA can easily propel you to the elite list. Still to quantify the criteria for GRE: I would say there is no magic score but 1300 should be safe. As for TOEFL: 90 should be fine. But most importantly a good Statement of Purpose and research oriented CV can do wonders. Actually your research ideas and ambitions are your USP.

Introduction: My experience interviewing with Providence India  Hyderabad for two different roles left me deeply disappointed and compelled me to share my thoughts through this Glassdoor review. Unfortunately I encountered unprofessional work attitudes during both interviews which left a lasting negative impression. I believe it is crucial to shed light on these experiences to help potential candidates gain a better understanding of the company's interview process and work culture. First Interview: For the first interview I was called to their office and faced immediate challenges. The interviewers had not reserved a room leading to a frantic search for an available space. Despite these initial setbacks I proceeded with the interview which consisted of general product questions. HR representative suggested that I leave for the day due to the unplanned absence of the secondround interviewer. However I never received any further communication from HR even though she had mentioned a second round conducted over Zoom. Although it is possible that I was rejected after the first round the complete lack of followup from the HR representative was unprofessional and disheartening. Second Interview: In the second interview I successfully cleared two rounds and was assigned a case study for the third round. Following the instructions provided by the Senior Product Manager I contacted HR to confirm the interview slots. To my surprise HR informed me that I had not cleared the second round despite being assigned a case study and asked to prepare. She requested time to confirm the status but subsequently ceased all communication leaving me without any further information positive or negative. Overall Impression: Despite Providence's plans to establish their GCC in India and their longterm vision my experiences with the current staff and interview process have left an overwhelmingly negative impression. I observed a recurring theme of unprofessionalism and lack of communication from the team and staff members I interacted with. As a result I have concerns regarding the pervasive culture at their Hyderabad office.,0.9979134,0.00195335,0.0001332178

Forenoon session  Talk on TFI Demo class session Group Discussion Critical Thinking .  Afternoon session  Personal Interview  There will be an evaluation gap between the two sessions and there might be onspot eliminations during that time.  Few tips for the FN session:  1) Demo class activity is for 5 minutes and the only part which need some good preparation.  Choose a cover able topic from the options of Grade and subjects you have.  Have something as your end goal for that particular class and try accomplishing that.  2) There is going to surprise questions from the evaluator! Be ready to handle those.  Have a good understanding of the topic.  3) Have supporting materials with you.  Spend some good time preparing them and planning how you are going to use it for the better understanding of the children.  4) Group discussion will be mostly easy.

Topic sentences are similar to mini thesis statements. Like a thesis statement a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is the main point of the essay the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement a topic sentence has a unifying function.

A peculiar experience!  After wasting time in 3 detailed interviews they realised my experience is way higher than the position I applied for hence they shortlisted someone with less experience.   Actually in my opinion all the rounds were good and promising but guess my current salary was the bottleneck and have been able to find resources with fewer packages would have helped them.   1 advice please ensure that you're not wasting candidate's time in unnecessary rounds even if there's 1 untick in the checklist of the desired candidate that you could spot at the beginning of the conversation then it's a no. That will save a lot of efforts on yours as well as on the candidate's end.,0.014230425,0.98544437,0.00032515303
They posted on a premium networking group on Facebook saying they are hiring fast for various roles applied through the website as instructed and didn’t hear back for 3 months till I requested for an update. Email response cc’d another HR representative who’d handle my application to discuss “next steps”  but no response for a couple of days again. After finally hearing back from them about the interview day and time it is rescheduled again until the next day (without formal communication confirming so). Interview the day after was pretty standard followed by tentatively scheduling  the next call with their product manager for the end of the week. Followed up asking about the meeting time and day with the product manager and timeline for their hiring process but no response ever since. Highly unprofessional and pretty disappointing considering they seemed to be working on some really cool projects.,0.9916293,0.0078102597,0.00056041346
Rigorous hiring process   first with a recruitment agency then over separate calls with HR and function manager followed by inperson interviews with function heads (one of whom actually seemed illprepared).

I was then made to wait at the office for over 2.5 hours for a scheduled interview with this individual after which I was told he was busy!  Also while the initial role was for fundraising over the course of the interview process it became evident that fundraising was only a tiny part of it and a majority of the work would encompass communications and PR.,0.9986338,0.0012213587,0.00014478964
