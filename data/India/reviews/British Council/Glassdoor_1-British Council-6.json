I was in the interview and background check process from the last 2 and a half months. When they offered me a salary it was not so good but HR asked me to join the company as they are providing permanent work from home. So i said yes to the same. After completing the entire procedure of background check and interviews which was very time taking. I went to the office to join on the 5th sept. As soon as i got in touch with my line manager. He mentioned how you will travel this far daily so i mentioned its WFH and line manager simply denied. He mentioned its permanent work from the office. When i informed him that i got this information from the HR team multiple times, he mentioned that right now we cannot do anything about it and this option of WFH is not on the table. Now i cannot join the company as i live in a different city and the salary that they offered me was good for WFH only. Now I don't have a job as i left my last one for this company and they are not simply saying it was jst wrong information shared by HR and it seems they don't care about it. Thank you so much for ruining my career. I will post this on each and every site that exists so that you will not ruin someone else's career. #liars British Council"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good",
