Over my two+ years of stay, I have seen the worst in them. The company has a lot of attrition (there are always roles available here). Main reasons for the attrition is the pathetic work culture and their narcissistic attitude. I won't really go into the malpractices they are involved in, but yes, they do indulge in it. Join product if you want a comparatively chill environment (the peer group is atrociously bad though). Join growth if you want a better peer group in terms of skill, but be surrounded by sadists and a early burnout is anything but guaranteed. The work culture is really bad, and it tends to attract folks who are of a similar attitude or culture. Ones who thrive in office politics and blame games, survive and thrive here, often staying here for years and years. As a result of this, people quickly adapt to not taking feedback and resorting to blame games (especially the newly joined junior folks). It gets to a point where getting work done becomes near impossible. Even though it's a startup, it does already feel really rigid. To summarize it all, my stay here was a really bad one.

But I'll be frank in my review. When you join Impactguru, you will feel very welcome. This is the honeymoon period. However, right after a week is when you get a taste of what is going to go wrong. Firstly, you will be given a TON of work, with absolutely no training. Often the person who you are replacing would have either absconded a long time ago, or the incompetent HR team wouldn't have bothered hiring a replacement till the person is out and the pressure comes from various directions. So there is almost a guarantee of not getting a good handover. And this is where the fun begins. Right from the first month, the founders will threaten to fire you if you don't perform well. What about the supposed training? They don't care. Add to this some really nasty managers and department heads. If you are the best performer (or the best performing team), expect all the work and blame to come on to you. Things work weird here in that way. This place has some of the worst workplace politics I've worked in. My mom used to advice to leave this place immediately. Your manager will screw you big time if she doesn't like you. You cannot speak up to the management - you will be encouraged to, but dare you speak up, you will suffer each day from there on. Impactguru HR policies also change on the fly as per their convenience. This was one of the most incompetent HR team I had experienced in my life. They play politics, don't communicate policies clearly, scheme with the founders, and then throw the department heads under the bus for everything. There is no ownership of work here. It's easier playing the blame game and not doing work. Like I said, the person working the best will get all the blame. That's how the culture is here. Founders are least bothered and live in their own echo chamber. Rude, arrogant, and distanced from reality. They will ask you to commit outrageous numbers and targets, and then later tie your performance pay to it. Very creative. And then they have the balls to say that you yourself committed to these targets! Sometimes I saw hope. That things will change. A new leader emerges who tries fixing everything. But then they'll just end up leaving fast or absconding, when they realize this culture is built from the top. You can't change the founders, and a company's culture is dependent on them. All in all, there are better places to work in and ensure your mental peace. You want to save lives, there are better organizations to join. If nothing works, join an NGO that actually does good work. Take care, and do good work. Your mental peace and sanity is not worth selling to a sum of money."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not a good experience.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Mumbai in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Social service and unique industry.", "cons": "There is a lot of mismanagement here.

The management gave excuses such as it is normal to wait more than months before the required action was taken. They made us fill out multiple attendance entry and exit procedures, even after that their team of HRs were incompatible to track it. Not only a few but the most part of the company faced salary issues that they released later. It wasn't enough that the pay cycle was late but people who have responsibilities would suffer even more. Taking their employees for granted is just an everyday thing. If you want to get into telecalling then only you should work in operations as their entire objective is to make their employees call and call. They would not only pay the dues of last month worked but also the higher management would disrespect and say that other people leaving was somehow my fault and not their company's lacking. They have released a payslip with false information of how much I have received it seems very unethical. I understand that I had to leave in 8 days notice period but that was because of the salary discrepancy in the first place. I was willing to be available as an when I would be able to make time from necessary commitments. I did not expect them to be okay with the arrangements, but disrespecting an employee is altogether a different thing.
