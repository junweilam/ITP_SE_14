It is a waste of their precious time in overstressed but underpaid life as a researcher in India, where there is little time to do research and grow. Don't throw gibberish such as training them in lab management as an excuse for this exploitation. If your regulations do not allow it in India get one. Lab management is not a student burden but faculty's responsibility and if not institute's responsibility.
