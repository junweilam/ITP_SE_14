Would request people aspiring to join this organization, please think of some other options. Working here will be share waste of your skills as you will never be allowed to use your ideas for the betterment of the organization. Ideas will be their and you have to implement those like a puppet. No growth opportunities. No balance in work life and personal life leads to frustration and suffocation. Many talented and hard working employees had been showed their way out of office in the past two years. The organization is running under a DUMB leader who has no experience at all. She even does not know how she is being fooled by the older staff.  Goes on hearsay and never uses brains."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Nice place to learn about how to work in area of public policy in India", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Science Policy Advisor in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "opportunity to work in area of  public policy, helpful administration, and saving animals", "cons": "lot of sops to follows, work-life balance, undue urgency in every project."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst Company  to Work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "only salary and Brand Name", "cons": "micromanagement, no trust on employee skills, no freedom for  innovation, lot of useless SOPs , No  Career Path, no work-life balance  and Senior management in India not independent to take decisions."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Online Marketing Coordinator", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Sept 2018", "job_title": "Online Marketing Coordinator in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The work, the environment, the work-life balance.", "cons": "The senior management competency and a hundred SOP's make work difficult."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "NILL", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Oct 2020", "job_title": "ERA in Juhu", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work Place, Celebrations, Events, Salary On Time", "cons": "Work Pressure, Work load, Politics"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jul 2012", "job_title": "Online Marketing Coordinator in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Its fun to work here", "cons": "Nothing as such.
