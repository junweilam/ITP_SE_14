You'll get access to mentors, opportunities, a supportive team, and passionate changemakers. I'd recommend you fully utilize all these channels during your fellowship. You'll regret it when the program is over. During my time as a Fellow, I met with every mentor that IDEX had us introduced us too, and was even personally introduced to mentors based on my interests. I took on interesting side projects, got critical feedback on my ideas, learned a lot about becoming a social intrapreneur, and built a network of peers & mentors. By the end of my fellowship, I was even offered numerous jobs by social enterprises in India. Lastly, IDEX has stayed in touch with me and been supportive post-fellowship too.", "cons": "IDEX does not hold your hand throughout the fellowship. If you're a self-starter, humble, an adventurer, and genuinely passionate about becoming a social intrapreneur / entrepreneur  \u2014 it's the perfect program for you. But if you're expecting someone to guide through your fellowship personally, you'll be disappointed. Their team will provide you with support as needed, but you're treated as an adult, don't expect anyone to chaperone your experience."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "There are better programmes out there!", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Mar 2016", "job_title": "IDEX Fellow in Bengaluru", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The best part of the IDEX Accelerator programme is the friendships you create with the other iDEX fellows. They are very supportive and sincere, we share our experiences and grow together.\r\n\r\nThe reading material IDEX provides is pretty good, albeit an overload. The mentors they connect with you are knowledgeable on their subject and they give you plenty of advice.", "cons": "The problem with IDEX Accelerator is their lack of association with the placements and placement mentors. No solid structure is in place for you to be guaranteed a fulfilling experience at your placement. This can be due to either, the placement not being a social enterprise, by that I mean the organisation's initial purpose of social impact is non-existent. Secondly, your placement mentor/manager doesn't have a structure in place to guide your experience and even give you work justifying your purpose being here. Some placement mentor/manager's will also carry a negative attitude. \r\n\r\nMany of my cohort that I was part of suffered from those two points and many of us we're disheartened that a lot of money and time was sacrificed in order for us to be here. What we weren't made aware of was that our placements paid for our time, we came here on the assumption that we we're doing our work voluntarily.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering this please do think hard. There are many other similar fellowships out there that have a solid structure for the fellows, free of any major costings, that are transparent and most importantly are empathetic towards your experience."}]]
