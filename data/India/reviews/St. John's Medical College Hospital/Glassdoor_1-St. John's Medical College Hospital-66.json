Other places motivate their employees by giving the best employee of the month award but here it's only negative feedback even after you give your blood n sweat.\r\n\r\nNewcomers are treated with bias. Senior staff can take leave whenever they want and make mistakes in office/lab; they also happily get away with it. Junior staffs always have to work on holidays without compensation off. If you ask for compensation off they will ask you the reason (which is unethical). If you do 50 things right (no one will acknowledge it and praise) but if you make 1 tiny mistake they will keep a meeting and create a huge issue as if they themselves are very perfect. Promotions are never given and payments are low as compared to your qualifications and experience. It is a charity institute so they don't pay much. Being a catholic institute, they fail to keep their catholic staff safe from bias and corrupt employees. Request for new types of equipment to start a new protocol/test is always turned down. They don't want to grow in terms of technology. Staff grievances are never dealt with and never encouraged. A person can still be in a junior post here even after 20 years of work experience. It's not worth the sacrifice. Appraisal letters are kept secret and never shown, nothing is transparent in the management system. There are people who lack proper communication and teamwork skills. They scream and shout in the office as if it was their kitchen and they even overpower HODs.  It's not a professional and healthy environment to work at. Some departments lack staff but the management overloads them with work instead of recruiting more staff. Some rules are totally absurd like working on a holiday without being given compensation off or holiday bonus."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life
