They offer a decent pay.\r\n2. A lot of responsibility was given right from the start.", "cons": "1. Was not clearly told that I would have to travel all alone to offbeat, isolated places that don't have even basic amenities. Reimbursement process is broken. The offer letter said I MAY have to travel, but the role was not explained in the beginning.\r\n2. The job title was that of a manager but I was technically an executive who worked as a content writer and editor. I didn't have to manage anyone at all. Very misguiding.\r\n3. Not at all a good place for atheists. Every Monday, they force their employees for an hour to listen to Bible readings and discussions of company policies on the basis of Christianity. It was shocking to see many non-Christians and non-Catholics participating in such illogical activities. Throughout my short tenure, religion was constantly being shoved down my throat, which was a major issue for me.\r\n4. Inefficient HR. They planned a company outing and had hired 2 buses to take the employees to the location. One bus driver was caught with no legal documents, the other almost drove a bus filled with many employees down the cliff. Joining this company can lead to you losing your life. Yet my manager complained about me not going for the outing.\r\n5. The manager would leave me with no task to perform the entire day and then would give a task at 6 in the evening, right when I had packed up and was leaving for home. Just plain harassment.\r\n6. As they are understaffed, as soon as I joined, I was given a lot of tasks and the previous employee was given hardly any work.\r\n7. A lot of the stuff I worked on was just deleted or completely disregarded. No communication was made regarding why the things I worked on were just removed by the manager.\r\n8. Was never given even a workdesk throughout my tenure of 1.5 months. I used to sit crammed between two desks, with no personal space or even a place to keep my things.\r\n9. For an NGO, it is ironic that most people who worked here, especially the management, are self-righteous, boastful and arrogant.\r\n10. No security person. It was risky working here till late, as any intruder could barge into the section where I was working.\r\n11. Was made to work even before my official date of joining. I was not compensated monetarily for that ever.\r\n12. The manager made me work on holidays, and when I would apply for compensatory offs, they would be rejected straightaway with no explanation. My manager, who was a male, would work till 1 or 2 in the morning and would expect women in the company to do the same, regardless of there being no security. The company acts like it owns you. No work-life balance. Most people I saw around me would be online on job portals hunting for jobs to escape this horrible company."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Excellent Organisation to work with", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Senior Director in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "You get to be the bridge between the powerful and powerless and serve the neediest of the needy in the community with support they would otherwise never dream of giving.
