Cognitive biases are common patterns of thinking that have been demonstrated to lead to errors in judgment and poor decision making. Unfortunately, the same simplicity that makes a pros-and-cons list so appealing creates many opportunities for a host of cognitive biases to emerge, including:\nFraming effect. Pros-and-cons lists generally are about evaluating two alternatives: a \u201cthumbs up or thumbs down\u201d scenario and an example of \u201cnarrow framing,\u201d a bias created by overly constraining the set of possible outcomes.\nOverconfidence effect. A well-established cognitive bias is the tendency of individuals to overestimate the reliability of their judgments. When creating a pros-and-cons lists, it is likely that many people assume a level of accuracy in their assessment of pros and cons that simply isn\u2019t there.\nIllusion of control. When faced with the task of envisioning possible outcomes, a common bias is to believe that one can control outcomes that in reality are not controllable."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Very good NGO for work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Oct 2021", "job_title": "NGO Volunteer in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people there are verfy friendly and helpful in nature, the way they work for others is really inspiring to me.
