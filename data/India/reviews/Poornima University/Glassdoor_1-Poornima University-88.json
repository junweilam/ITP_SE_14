From the moment I joined, it became evident that the organization lacked a supportive and nurturing environment for its employees. There was a pervasive atmosphere of negativity, with little to no respect or appreciation shown towards the staff. The management's behaviour was consistently dismissive and unsupportive, fostering an environment of fear and insecurity rather than fostering professional growth.", "cons": "During my 4 year tenure at Poornima University, I encountered a highly toxic working environment where the management displayed a complete lack of support and respect for the long-standing employees. Their unsupportive nature and disregard for the older employees were evident throughout my time there. I was constantly subjected to the threat of termination, as if there were no job opportunities available elsewhere in the market. This fear-inducing tactic employed by the management created an atmosphere of insecurity and uncertainty among the employees. Furthermore, the institution exhibited a clear lack of belief in employee growth and development, opting instead to exploit their staff through compulsion rather than motivation. There was an absence of any form of encouragement or recognition for the hard work and dedication I put into my role, making my four-year journey with Poornima University feel akin to being confined within a jail. One incident that garnered significant attention within the city was the mass firing of over 100 employees during the Covid-19 pandemic, which was executed through a single order. This display of power and disregard for the well-being and livelihoods of the affected individuals and their families highlights the inflated ego of the management, as they prioritized their own needs above those of their employees. Despite feeling disheartened by my experience, I am now filled with a sense of relief as I look forward to what lies ahead. I am confident that whatever awaits me in the future will be far better than the last four years I spent at this university. I strongly caution others against becoming involved with such a low-value institution, where employees are treated as mere laborers and their well-being is disregarded. It is worth noting that the institution's admission process relies heavily on consultants, raising concerns about their moral values and ethical standards. The management's focus on quantity over quality is a recurring theme, as they prioritize admission numbers above the actual performance and qualifications of prospective students. This approach undermines the integrity and reputation of the institution, further highlighting their disregard for quality education. In conclusion, my review of Poornima University paints a bleak picture of a working environment marred by toxic management practices, a lack of respect for employees, and an obsession with quantity over quality. It is my hope that this review serves as a warning to others, allowing them to make informed decisions when considering their association with this institution."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "do not join", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "19 Dec 2022", "job_title": "Associate Professor in Jaipur, Rajasthan", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "no pros, only cons, teacher will be sales executives as well", "cons": "late salary, no benefits, no fixed structure"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Assistant Professor in Jaipur, Rajasthan", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fine for new joiners and great", "cons": "Things to learn like erp."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Delivery Driver in New Delhi", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Poor dor culture job action and wishing you want to be a great work", "cons": "Good for company and working in it"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Review of Poornima University", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Jul 2021", "job_title": "PhD Student in Jaipur, Rajasthan", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The academic sessions are good and even they are going into digital education which I guess is must and there is more practical things, theory less study.
