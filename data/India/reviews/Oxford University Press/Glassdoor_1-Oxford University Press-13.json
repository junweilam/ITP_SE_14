It goes without saying that experiences may differ depending on which team you're in and/or who you report to.", "cons": "\u2013 Offhand treatment of employees\r\n\u2013 Inability to value and reward talent\r\n\u2013 Rampant inefficiency\r\n\u2013 Poor decision-making at the upper-management level and among business stakeholders\r\n\u2013 Slow to transform and adapt to changes, both in terms of operations and products \r\n\r\nLet me elaborate.  \r\n\r\nRecently, under the pretext of business/financial crisis as a result of COVID-19, the organization laid off several employees. But at the same time they've had the audacity to expect some of the same employees to do the same work as vendors. Basically, it appears that they want people to work for them without giving the reward and recognition these people rightfully deserve in exchange. They want to stay on the 'gaining' side, while the people who work for them get the shorter end of the stick. It just goes to show how little they value their employees, especially the ones in junior and mid-level roles. On the one hand, toxic and/or incompetent people somehow get to secure their positions and even rise in the ranks. On the other hand, trustworthy and competent people who break their backs to secure good business deals or handover projects on time either quit out of frustration at the many issues and injustices around them or are told to leave. \r\n\r\nThe organization expects its employees to 'upskill' themselves (like any modern organization rightfully should), but it doesn't give everyone the equal opportunities or means to do so. For instance, the organization has a tie-up with LinkedIn Learning whereby regular employees have free and unlimited access to the platform, but contractual employees don't have the same access. Contractual employees are expected to deliver the same level of performance and quality of work as any regular employee, so it's unfair that they aren't given the same means to learn and grow. Maybe at least help them with alternative means? But no, zero assistance. Secondly, the equipment (namely, laptops) provided to the employees are of a poor quality and only hinder work as they're prone to frequent malfunctions. There's also a poor IT support in place where it takes forever to get anything done or fixed. How can anyone be expected to work and deliver results on time when they don't have the proper equipment or resources to work with? \r\n\r\nThe upper-management and HR are inefficient and subpar at communication. There were multiple occasions where I approached HR for certain things, but they didn't even acknowledge my emails, let alone addressing them. On a few occasions they responded only after I followed up and reminded them. There's another instance where there was a sudden change in the rules regarding access to a certain something. But this change in rules was communicated neither to the employees involved nor their manager(s), and in the end the manager(s) was/were reprimanded even though it was no fault of theirs. The change in rules wasn't communicated beforehand so how could anyone have known? \r\n\r\nThe business stakeholders are indecisive and laid-back when it comes to important decisions. Good deals are brought in, but they get shelved due to inaction or delayed action on the part of the stakeholders. In general it appears that most people here don't have any clarity on what to do and how to get it done. A project is given a go-ahead, and you're expected to work at a breakneck speed and deliver within an unreasonable deadline, but just as you're halfway through your assignment or have completed it, the project gets shelved all of a sudden due to some vague reason. And this happens not once or twice but repeatedly, so it's like a cycle where you put your effort into something but never see it through to the end, which leaves you dissatisfied and makes you wonder what your purpose here even is. In more practical terms, what this means is, you can't claim such projects as a part of your work experience on your CV or in an interview as they don't exist as finished products in the market, and company policy bars you from revealing info on anything that hasn't been published. \r\n\r\nFor all its lofty claims about growing and adapting, the organization is in fact super slow to evolve and adapt to changes. Until COVID-19 hit and everyone was forced by circumstances to be exclusively reliant on virtual/digital services, there were many processes that were dependent on outdated paperwork despite the organization's policy of 'reducing paper use' (the irony!) It's only due to the pandemic and the WFH situation that some of these processes went virtual, and that too took weeks for the implementers to 'figure out' how to go about it. Why were we handing over hard copies of invoices, proposal forms and the like in the first place when the whole thing could've been easily done online? And this is only one of the many examples. On the business side, the organization has repeatedly squandered opportunities for establishing a solid digital presence in the market \u2013 even in the current scenario where demand for digital products has been on the rise.

Although the GJC is meant to classify roles as support, IC, manager, or executive and across levels 1 to 12, it also has salary bands that are wider than the nation. Their yearly salary revisions \"based on performance\" are barely cost-of-living/inflation adjustments. The only way to move from one band to another is to leave the company, join a competitor, and come back at a higher band. I have seen people who have stayed for half a decade or more with no change in bands. I have seen people who have been offered a promotion with no change in bands or salary revision.\r\nThere is no promotion of learning or inclusivity, no culture of feedback. I was starved for intellectual conversation during my years there. In the Noida office, there must've been anywhere between 200 and 300 employees walking in and out of the office - yet I had only been introduced to a handful and those only because I needed to work with them. Over time, I began smiling at people randomly and introducing myself and asking people questions and maybe got to know 20 more people. People work in silos. Nobody knows what the hell anybody else is working on. Zero cross-departmental talk.\r\nAnd so many issues with the products there - don't get me started - \"quality\" is a value of theirs - what a joke! To be fair, products outside India seem to be fine, so does their team that sits outside India. However, they couldn't care less about India and the products that are made and sold here.\r\nMany departments here are not just incompetent, but also lack integrity. And worst of all, everyone has to individually email the admin team to book meeting rooms - I'm sorry, which century are you still in? Just automate the whole process already.\r\nThere is a whole lot of politics and ass-licking here, not to mention the rampant gossiping.
