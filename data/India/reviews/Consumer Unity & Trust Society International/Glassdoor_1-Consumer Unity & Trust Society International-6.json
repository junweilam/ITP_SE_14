Most of the people working here (and leaving this place) are not even remotely tech-friendly which explains the lack of reviews. A couple of other reviews are misattributed. \r\n\r\nThe Cons are too many:\r\n\r\n- Poor paymaster. The \"increments\" are remarkably low. \r\n\r\n- Unsafe working environment, especially for females.\r\n\r\n- Stinky office with poor infrastructure. The male and female washroom has a common window - yes, that's right -  which overlooks into each other.\r\n\r\n- Negative and destruction work environment. The employees are constantly scared.\r\n\r\n- Highly political environment. The Management itself indulges in and propagates work politics. \r\n\r\n- Extremely rude, disrespectful, egotistical bosses and top management. CUTS is not an organisation, it is a family-owned business run by the high-handed, uncultured family. Their favourite word has to be \" you're terminated\". These people are highly vindictive. \r\n\r\n- Obsolete, unreasonable, and futile \"processes\". A lot of micromanagement - the management loves to create an atmosphere full of tension.\r\n\r\n- Very high attrition rate. \r\n\r\n- Weird \"disciplinary\"policies which are nothing but domineering and vigilance tactics. Example: you can't leave your seat without informing someone. And if you do, you better be back in 5 minutes. \r\n\r\n- Poor policies, with lots of loops. \r\n\r\n- Dead end jobs, with no future or growth.\r\n\r\n- The HR team is a joke. Uncouth and crude.\r\n\r\n- Invalid deductions, no PF, no bonuses, no other incentive.\r\n\r\n- Extreme exploitation. They'll favour the favourites, though. Ones who are their sycophants. \r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, I would strongly advise the smart ones to stay away from this place which claims to be an organization. Especially those talented millennials - you can do better! You don't deserve to, and frankly shouldn't dedicate yourself to such conceited, uncouth, vindictive, and apathetic bunch - to whom the employees, the people, basic human decency don't matter. \r\n\r\nThis world is changing fast, organizations like CUTS don't cut it anymore, and sooner or later they'll know it."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "GREAT PLACE TO WORK", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "27 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Deputy Executive Director in Jaipur, Rajasthan", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "1.
