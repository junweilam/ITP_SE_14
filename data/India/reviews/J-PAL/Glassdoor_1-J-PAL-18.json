The general structure of the organization is extremely exploitative and PIs get much more from the experience than RAs. Despite the fact that the RAs are literally indispensable for the research they are literally relegated to a footnote in the paper. In truth RAs bring more value to the research than the PIs. The worst part is that that RAs take this exploitation with the hope that their PIs will give them rla recommendation letter for grad school in the US. Sadly these letters are not as forthcoming as RAs initially expect. To think that students in the US can get the same letters simply for doing well in the professors class, a class that meets two times a week for an hour and a half is a level of unfairness that is truly disgusting. I am the only person I am aware of from my time at JPAL that ever ended up in a top notch PhD program in the USA, out of almost 10 to 15 close friends who were RAs at the time. A few went to the USA for MBAs but this was the exception not the norm.

Given the time difference between professors in the USA and regional field offices, work is sometimes assigned in the afternoon USA time to be completed immediately, requiring RAs to occasionally pull all-nighters to get things done. The PI power dynamic relative to the employees means that the personalities and characters of the PIs can completely shape the employees experience. \r\n\r\nAs for the organization itself (as versus the PIs), the management has a focus on getting projects done rather than on supporting or respecting employees. The pay scale is very low for the industry, is purposefully not transparent, and different roles are not paid based on education, work experience or workload. Additionally, the regional field offices have work conditions such that RAs are sometimes exposed to infectious disease and threats of violence.  The organization has expanded so rapidly that management has not been able to put structures in place to cope with these problems. \r\n\r\nDespite this, the pros really do outweigh the cons - but for about a year or so.
