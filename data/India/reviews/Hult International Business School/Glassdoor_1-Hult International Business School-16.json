Senior management is totally biased and hiring and firing is the most common practice there(either you are fired or you are forced to resign if you want to save your career from getting hampered by being terminated). Personal commitments are not respected.Your growth or performance is not co related to how you perform,its based on how your equation is with your manager/management is on a personal level.The 360 degree feedback is just a formality,no actual feedback is taken from the employee and is worked upon by the management. The office including my ex colleagues are scared to even put their valid points forward."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "ASIne", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Project Manager in Ahmedabad", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "awesome company and good and nice and well", "cons": "no much available con As far as i think"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2020", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Bengaluru", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good...
