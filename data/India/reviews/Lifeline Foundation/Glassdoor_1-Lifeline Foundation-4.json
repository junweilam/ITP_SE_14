My job expectation was simple from the company: It was to conduct First Aid and CPR training for a collection of audience from various walks of life. To me, this was the most difficult job and unfortunately it being the first job itself. So, the duties included teaching topics mostly in Hindi and local Gujarati (which I was really bad at both) and English was very minimal to be used (wherein I was very fluent at). Dr Das had his second thoughts on me but I took it up as a challenge and in three months of time, I was able to deliver topics (at least if not fluently) but to an understandable extent to the sitting audience who in time, I learnt had started to pay attention than earlier. I bought a lot of Hindi novels and local Gujarati dailies to equip my vocabulary to deliver better. \r\nIn the next three months, Dr Das gave me more training experience and this included pan-India travel and with more exposure came more feedback which we always received from the audience to rate the trainers. My ratings grew from pathetic to satisfactory and at times exceptional and Dr Das was happy. \r\nI was promoted to a Training Officer. My duties in in the job now didn't stop just there, I was also given additional roles and responsibilities wherein I used to conduct Paramedic interviews for our OHC staff and train them initially; further do B2C marketing for societies to sensitize the awareness in learning CPR and First aid; to handle the keys of the cabinet as an Admin Rep and manage them between training periods. Overall, this role, not only gave me a widespread and\r\n an over-exposure of opportunities in cultivating interpersonal skills but also the art of talking briskly, lucidly, fluently and with reason to the public; befriending strangers on the first call or first meet; taking more and more responsibilities within a short span of time based on your abilities; maintaining business etiquette while meeting top management Clients and living together as a family as the staff count was very small. \r\n\r\nToday, when I see myself from the career evolution perspective, I can handle any kind of responsibility or pressure thrown at me at any organisational or hierarchical level because I rose from scratch to top in just 9 months which takes people at least between 2 to 5 years to understand the wisdom every job has to offer elsewhere. Trust me, had I wanted to take the above as a gripe or complaint, I would have stuffed it in the CONS section. I wouldn't shun the fact that it was too much to handle at times because of the consumption of work, but at the end of the training, you feel satisfied and relieved having borne responsibilities and sacrifices. \r\n\r\nDr Das brought a life-changing moment that I won't forget in my life ever when I told him that I was taking a lot in my plate: \"If every person were to think too much of their work and life balance and say I did this and that to come here, we would get whiners everywhere all the time! That's how Amitabh Bachan and Shah Rukh Khan were made in the first place compared to thousands of thousands who wanted their big breaks but couldn't make it!\"", "cons": "If you think there are cons!

It's a high-pressure work environment, I guarantee that and involves too many responsibilities that will only benefit and shape a person's career as they go up the ladder.

My job expectation was simple from the company: It was to conduct First Aid and CPR training for a collection of audience from various walks of life. To me, this was the most difficult job and unfortunately it being the first job itself. So, the duties included teaching topics mostly in Hindi and local Gujarati (which I was really bad at both) and English was very minimal to be used (wherein I was very fluent at). Dr Das had his second thoughts on me but I took it up as a challenge and in three months of time, I was able to deliver topics (at least if not fluently) but to an understandable extent to the sitting audience who in time, I learnt had started to pay attention than earlier. I bought a lot of Hindi novels and local Gujarati dailies to equip my vocabulary to deliver better. \r\nIn the next three months, Dr Das gave me more training experience and this included pan-India travel and with more exposure came more feedback which we always received from the audience to rate the trainers. My ratings grew from pathetic to satisfactory and at times exceptional and Dr Das was happy. \r\nI was promoted to a Training Officer. My duties in in the job now didn't stop just there, I was also given additional roles and responsibilities wherein I used to conduct Paramedic interviews for our OHC staff and train them initially; further do B2C marketing for societies to sensitize the awareness in learning CPR and First aid; to handle the keys of the cabinet as an Admin Rep and manage them between training periods. Overall, this role, not only gave me a widespread and\r\n an over-exposure of opportunities in cultivating interpersonal skills but also the art of talking briskly, lucidly, fluently and with reason to the public; befriending strangers on the first call or first meet; taking more and more responsibilities within a short span of time based on your abilities; maintaining business etiquette while meeting top management Clients and living together as a family as the staff count was very small. \r\n\r\nToday, when I see myself from the career evolution perspective, I can handle any kind of responsibility or pressure thrown at me at any organisational or hierarchical level because I rose from scratch to top in just 9 months which takes people at least between 2 to 5 years to understand the wisdom every job has to offer elsewhere. Trust me, had I wanted to take the above as a gripe or complaint, I would have stuffed it in the CONS section. I wouldn't shun the fact that it was too much to handle at times because of the consumption of work, but at the end of the training, you feel satisfied and relieved having borne responsibilities and sacrifices. \r\n\r\nDr Das brought a life-changing moment that I won't forget in my life ever when I told him that I was taking a lot in my plate: \"If every person were to think too much of their work and life balance and say I did this and that to come here, we would get whiners everywhere all the time! That's how Amitabh Bachan and Shah Rukh Khan were made in the first place compared to thousands of thousands who wanted their big breaks but couldn't make it!\"", "cons": "If you think there are cons! Trust me, you won't be able to work or adjust anywhere. The strongest of CONS is its strongest PROS! If you've the mindset of a person who's ready to take any amount of load-work to better your career and future so that you don't go through similar situations time again like a loop in your life, you can go for this Org, else DON'T! Sometimes, we need to understand the often forgotten fact that people are made for jobs too! I'm thoroughly happy that this become my first job and in fact, a noble job. Because who gets to tell people, \"Hey, you've the ability and authority to save a life when there is a need\" ?\r\n(And if you think this is a hype review, trust me, no one paid for me, I wrote this out of sheer diligence and gratitude to the founding institution where one recognizes if they are really built up to become strong or whine and become weak!)\r\n\r\nAlso, please don't go by bad comments that say it's a terrible place to work or calling Dr Das foul words. It's a high-pressure work environment, I guarantee that and involves too many responsibilities that will only benefit and shape a person's career as they go up the ladder. Every other Org does that too!
