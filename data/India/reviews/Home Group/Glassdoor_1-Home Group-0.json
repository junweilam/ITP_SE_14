It was embarrassing trying to defend such poor service and their catastrophically brutal budget cuts.\nThere seems to constantly be a restructure, each one starts just as staff are getting used to  new way of working and before anyone has really had a chance to see if it works. I left just over a year ago in the last restructure (voluntarily I might add) and there is already another restructure happening again. This constant uncertainty is not conducive to an emotionally healthy place to work.\nAll the perks (flexi time, office hours, every weekend off) went in the last restructure with no pay increase to soften the blow.\nAfter being there for 10 years employees gradually felt less and less cares about and more of a number of a commodity which can easily be replaced."}]]
