Why? here's the reason: - HR never treats you with respect especially Ashish who is HR Manager - Very poor salary hikes. only 1500- 2000 rupees no matter how much work you do for department. Even people who don't do any work and remain on leaves always also get same hike. then where's the difference. - no personal growth. teachers never get chance to teach other subjects. keep on teaching same 1 or 2 subjects for all years until you leave this organization n this will stop your career growth. - too much document work and resubmission of same documents again and again shows poor management. -- no benefits given to employee. -- no maternity leave. They will say u r eligible for 2 months paid leave and in the end will give you only 50% of 1 month by saying its our policy we give 50% of 50%. OMG In short, Chandigarh university is earning so much from students' fees but is keeping everything in its own pocket and dont like to give anything to their employees. totally business. - HODs condition is worse. They dont get any vacations. have to stay till late night during audits and all saturdays working. - Sometimes they even call on Sunday and make it mandatory for silly events."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not worthy", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "17 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Content Writer in Chandigarh", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "No pros all cons for this university.

This remote location might not be convenient for individuals who prefer to live or work in the heart of a bustling city. Limited industry exposure: Although Chandigarh University offers a range of academic programs, its location away from major metropolitan areas might limit opportunities for industry exposure and collaboration with renowned companies and professionals. This could affect networking and career growth prospects. Limited research opportunities: While Chandigarh University emphasizes research and innovation, it might not provide the same level of research opportunities and resources as some of the top-tier universities in larger cities or research hubs. This could be a disadvantage for researchers or academicians looking for extensive research collaborations and funding. Cultural diversity: Chandigarh University attracts a significant number of students from the local region and nearby states. As a result, the cultural diversity within the campus might be relatively limited compared to universities located in more cosmopolitan areas. This might affect the exposure to different cultures and perspectives for both faculty and staff. Housing and amenities: Mohali, where Chandigarh University is situated, might not offer as many housing options or amenities as a larger city like Chandigarh.
