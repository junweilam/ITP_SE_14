When I finally joined my city and got to meet my children, I understood there was a lot to be done, and the path was laid out for me. It was challenging, but with the constant support of my PM, co fellows and staff, I have been able to take my kids on a transformational journey.

I was harassed within the school premises of the school I was placed in but no action was taken by the organization despite multiple complaints by me. I informed the respective authorities as soon as possible but not even once did anyone from the organization visited the school and addressed it with the authorities in person. Instead, I was made to recall the traumatic incident multiple times over Zoom meetings which triggered my mental health to the point I fell sick and had to take a career gap for months. Apart from this, we (me and other fellows) were disrespected and humiliated by the school authorities every single day and whenever we raised the issue, the organization replied that they will talk, and hold a meeting but it was all futile. Instead, the organization always sided with the school authorities and agreed to the unrealistic demands made by them (doing administrative work of non-TFI section as well in addition to the usual teaching and organization work) despite our complaints. My experience at Teach For India has been really terrible and I sincerely do not wish any other fellow in future to have the same experience that I had. Therefore, before you join the fellowship, I would suggest you talk to other fellows as well, know their experience, and then make your decision instead of just believing TFI\u2019s \u201ccompassion, collaborative, communication\u2019 narrative\u201d.
