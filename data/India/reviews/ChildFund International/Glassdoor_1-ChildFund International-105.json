Office politics is too much here. You need to keep your manager happy all the time otherwise you may get fired from job; any time without notice. The one who keeps talk bad about others survive for long. \r\nBasically it is a funding agency. Due to lack of strict monitoring system, most the the implementing partners and  Program Managers  have become super rich. Suppose when you visit any partnering organisation for monitoring purpose and if you find any malpractice or financial misappropriation you should keep yourself blind. IF you bring this to the notice of Child Fund management then next day you will be fired... Programs/Policies on paper are really good but when it comes to the implementation it is worst. I pity the donors from all over the world who donate.
