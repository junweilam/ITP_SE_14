They are changed faster than the \"New\" courses the university starts and ends. With so much attrition and firings that happens its no surprise there is lack of a culture and vision in the organization.\n\nSince i will keep this neutral to my experience in the Admission department here is what i experienced and saw:\n1. No appraisal done since years so if you wanna spend a year or 1.5 year its ok. Growth here is like ache din which havent yet come and unlikely to ever.\n2. No motivation and team building done. No B'days, Diwali celebrated or employee trips done. \n3. Lack of authority in the admission department where decisions on marketing are taken by academic background people who are registrars/VCs/Dean of the university who dont understand how marketing works. \n4. University infrastructure is below average although it was once good due to no maintainence done. There was a fire that happened here (google it) and for atleast a year till i worked here the burnt building section behind reception has remained same with no repair. \n5. Usually people leave by 5pm which leaves you with some time for personal work.\n6. If you are a non teaching staff you will always be kept at a lower level than teaching. The teachrs can take leaves, holidays while rest have to report on most holidays.\n7. The goal of the university management is to get enough admissions so university can be sold off to the highest bidder as its in a prime location although the name is bad in market. This unfortunately hasnt happened since past 7 years. \n8. Delayed salaries are a given(sometimes months). \n9. Lack of ANY training for non academic staff. Even the sales team is pretty untrained.\n10. Due to bad practices done it has a poor name in market so sales are hard. The student crowd is the usual scorpio owning gurgaon boys.
