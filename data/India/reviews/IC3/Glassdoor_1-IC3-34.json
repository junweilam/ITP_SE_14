They show dat they are doing amazing work for the education community but they really are only serving the powerful and the rich.\r\n3. People leave this org left, right and center. And they never even address it to the team! Insulting!!! No closure\r\n4. Bad for newcomers because they never give enough time for people to settle in. They throw stuff at them like it's a circus.\r\n5. They make sure you can't have a life \r\n6. Everyone talks how their attrition is beyond the roof. Every 6 months a new team.\r\n7. The CEO watches everyone from his room, theirs cctv everywhere!!!! Can you believe it, this 2022????!\r\n8. Pay is terrible & you are made to feel bad if you ask for a deserved appraised\r\n9. They make you feel bad about your work and employees are regularly compared with each other.\r\n10. They hate when you take leaves. They love people who can work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They keep Saturdays working sometimes.\r\n11. No clarity in your managers/leads. All last moment stuff. Everything is run by just 1 person. And then they blame you when things fail!\r\n12. I heard that they asked employees to take pay cuts in the pandemic year and never paid them back!!!"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst company to work in", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are absolutely no pros in this organization.", "cons": "Hypocrisy, backstabbing, lies, false ideas, scam"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good at the start", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "11 May 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Mumbai", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work in the field", "cons": "Low salaries and overworked employees"}], []]
