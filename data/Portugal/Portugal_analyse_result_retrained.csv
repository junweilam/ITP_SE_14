No control over entry or exit time. People make the job and the people here will step on you if they have to. Too much competition entices people to suck up to the professors and try to demean others. Although you have no entry or exit time you are almost always working. You can work seven days a week. Its expected from you (to be on pair with others) to read articles all the time. Therefore although you can leave early you probably will sometimes work till 20h 21h 22h and sometimes throughout the night. You almost always leave of scholarships which means if you don't get one you probably have to wait a year to apply again and since you are not even entitled to pay after your scholarship ends. You either find another job or have to live out of someone else for the whole year.,0.99881184,0.001032673,0.00015553064
