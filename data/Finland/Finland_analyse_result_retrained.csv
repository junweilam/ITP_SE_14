 A supervisor can make or break a PhD but mine is great so far.  Staff and other students are thoughtful caring and fun.  Relatively low bureaucracy lots of breathing room to do your research lots of trust.  Very good salary for PhD students even if it is low compared to industry.,0.00060396554,0.00067827426,0.9987178
 Not much effort is made to integrate new students into the culture of the school you have to take the initiative and do this yourself.  General unhealthy culture of overworking among supervisors depends a lot on the supervisor can also add pressure on the students.  Admin systems are fragmented and not streamlined.

"The HR is a nightmare  during my time (10 yrs) there were nearly a dozen changes to the mandatory HR services employees had to use. There was very little almost nonexistent onboarding for these services. Hiring people for research projects was cumbersome and there was no help from HR whatsoever. As others (particularly on the PhD research side) have written as well there are a lot of abrupt management  changes and ambiguity on the leadership. Also while there is money it is often very hard (requires incredible amount of bureaucracy) to get funding for even some minuscule things that would have an order of magnitude impact on the efficiency of research. It was already like this back in the early 2010's. Planning of teaching is impossible as there is no continuity (it's useless to iterate and develop courses if there is no guarantee that they will even be held next year). Money allocation especially in ARTS is preferential towards flashy projects and fundamental research and accumulation of talent is neglected.  There are specific individuals from the preAalto era who have been given special treatment (i.e. free hands and money to waste on vaporware projects and hand waving laboratories with no tangible output). A lot of ""change for the sake of change"" management especially under the tenure of Teeri ugly power struggles rise their head mostly in ARTS. Organizing and planning anything in the long term is very tiring in Aalto. I'm happy as hell to have my degree and not have to rely on Aalto as an employer.",0.99814844,0.0015720091,0.00027956915

 Stressfull short term contracts for (some) doctoral candidates and always need to worry about how to fund the next semester/year  Overly demanding and inflexible beurucratic system makes life difficult for all researchers  Recent cutbacks (jan 2016) means layoffs and less academic funding available to fight for  Not enough industry connection career advancement outside academia seams daunting  Lots of inhouse politics to navigate  I was unlucky and also had a poorly functioning group and group leadership  Not enough international diversity of researchers mostly Finnish people (although most speak excellent english),0.99854916,0.001294435,0.00015642244
Good opportunities but somehow lacks direction and incentives to push to the next level. Some departments have very nice facilities some on the other hand don't. Do your homework and visit the site before you join.,0.10321424,0.8902216,0.006564163
Joint venture of three universities is still shaping to get it's act together. Good opportunities are there but somewhat lost in chaotic politics/management.  Lack of funding in some departments is evident people have little time to interact.

 too many useless meetings discussions etc.  no realistic scientific career path within Aalto University (tenuretrack positions are too competitive to be a realistic option)  low pay (drastic contrast with companies close by)  lots of info passed informally (and in Finnish only) i.e. not friendly for international staff,0.99914503,0.0006879585,0.00016701121

Hardly any paths for career advancement. The majority of young research talent is forced to move elsewhere or selffund.  The internal finance system is ridiculous and inefficient with departments paying 'rent' to use buildings already owned or leased by the university. This leads to space laying dormant whilst the used space is overcrowded.,0.99907243,0.00076896837,0.00015846163

 The power and time of your supervising professor are quite limited and thus there is no person who can really take care of you. Getting funding is the sole responsibility of you and your supervising professor.  Mandatory teaching duties for doctoral candidates.  Employment contracts are limited by 1 year. This also limits work permits from Migri by 1 year.  Offices are formed of people from different projects and they have means of isolating people from each other.,0.9989748,0.0008723942,0.00015274933
A very friendly and functional environment. The research that is done feels impactful and you can see the results in the projects.

The environment is very international and that is extremely nice.,0.00019087727,0.0003115907,0.99949753
The negative parts are probably like in all jobs that are in the field of academia. From research to actually completing a project and seeing it happening in the real technological field the time stretches quite more.,0.99332726,0.0065444373,0.00012824059

 As usual the pros and cons is depending on your PI (boss). The university is quite flexible in implementing any rules and they let it be managed by the PI. But the worklife balance in general in Finland is pretty good.  There are local foundations that can provide scholarships to postdocs. It is not quite difficult as they are not quite known outside of Finland. A lot of these funding allows the postdoc to work independently without a PI or a boss and from anywhere in the world.,0.0012280865,0.989684,0.009088019
 Total remote work from home is not possible. However I know this is negotiable with the PI and doable.  Beware that the job market and especially the postdoctoral opportunities in Finland is not much. So if your funding is finished perhaps you should switch countries or switch to industry jobs.

Salaries are not competitive internationally and there is zero flexibility to reward staff to develop the promising young minds or to retain the experts. The University insists on stricter requirements for a PhD than e.g. Russell group universities in the UK but with no visible benefits from jumping through all the hoops. The situation is very similar with staff  the University wants to make it as hard as possible for people to progress in their careers but with poor starting salaries and no international clout to speak of it makes it exceedingly hard to retain the talent in Helsinki. University leadership appears to focus on teaching and forgets that research is also an important assessment criteria in international rankings. The low level of research funding cause resentment and internal fighting between Faculties and research institutes and keeps the University from fulfilling its research potential. Also this being Finland there are endless evaluations (up to 6 per year) that take time from research teaching and funding applications. Most damningly there does not appear to be a coherent strategic plan for the University of its parts.,0.9989625,0.0008779182,0.00015951564

" Low salary Uncertainty about finantial stability Uncertainty about which administrative personnel can help you with what tasks. Especially the HR people have been changing often and that leaves researchers to spend time and energy figuring out how to use this or that software without help. Acquiring new equipment for research is a full time job because of the lack of flexibility of the tendering office. If something goes wrong there you lose your grant and your equipment. Lack of freedom to work on grand projects need to publish every year rather than doing one big project. Despite the worker's agreement having a clear definition of tasks and performance for the salary table the university only raises a salary a maximum of 7% every two years even if your salary comes from an outside grant. This maximum is set regardless of how your responsibilities and duties may have increased over the last year. This is against the worker's agreement. The salary change from PhD student (category 4) to postdoc (category 5) is 80e because when you move up in job requirements you must go down in the performance percentage again regardless of what the workers agreement indicates. Vacation days expire if unused but you can only use them if your vacations are approved by your supervisor. While researchers are in an ""Annual hours"" contract we still must mark the sick days as a fix number of hours. If you work on a weekend or official holiday it does not count as worked day. If you don't work on a weekday it counts as a vacation day of which you have a set number rather than hours.

This is a university with fantastic faculty in a picture perfect clean Finnish natural environment by a lake in Central Finland. Free education system of Finland cheap high quality day care available and uni services are quite extensive. On campus there is great architecture as this is Finland's second oldest university with real Alvar Aalto buildings on campus. In every faculty there are really nice and helpful colleagues where the competition is not the most important thing but individuals are mostly interested in new ideas and teaching and development. Interdisciplinary work is appreciated. Takes employee welfare quite seriously chance to achieve good work life balance if you live in JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ and easy commute to nearby cities even to Helsinki by bus or train. Great techsupport as well as access to journals and information systems for library and open access publishing. JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ is a very safe small city environment with average age of citizen around 24 so youthful. The current (2021) uni leadership is very development friendly so new development projects are rolled out all the time. There is very much academic freedom to decide research streams. As many universities in Finland have downsized JYU has had no layouts due to great financial investments on the uni leadership level innovative and talented Rector who develops multiple things at once. For new professor (associate level also) hires there is a great funding of several tens of thousands of euro to form your own research group in a form of a welcome package for new professors good support for grant writing and budgeting. Much depends on the faculty and the dean / department head of how things are run. Good infrastructure wireless everywhere and ability to get help for issues from IT to log ins quite well. Takes student experience quite seriously and many faculties work very well with student unions and feedback to integrate changes into existing structures to make life better. If there is a serious issue this will be taken seriously and health care system is excellent. If you have stress related symptoms health services are available from psychologist to medical doctors.,0.0003842014,0.00046894312,0.9991468
"Rigid HR and compensation systems that move slow major pay differences among faculties and gender/age/seniority/discipline differences (say ITprofessor of practice and professor of Swedish language) stupid early adoption of certain registration systems before they are fully developed no secretaries (for much of anything) very poorly organized faculty support system for practical tasks and administration (professors pretty much have to search reserve rooms feed grades into a system for all hundreds of students answer questions etc. which COULD easily be done by secretaries and coordinators so wasting faculty talent on that) obsessive preference on international hires (who then do not help with any of the administration work which is mostly in Finnish) highly ambitious aims and targets for international publications and external research funding for which very little time is actually dedicated. Totally unreasonable ""work plans"" where 75 h is allocated every day when the real workload is around 910 h a day (which you can not feed into the system. Sigh). Administrators come first in the planning of much of the university development projects the ""researcher first"" is not yet reality compensation for travel I hear is now changing toward the better but it used to cost to go abroad for an exchange with the family as the uni used to only compensate the researcher's accomodation travel and life. Some faculties rule (math physics Sport Education) over other faculties partly due to historical developments. Some old buildings continue to have indoor air quality issues (mold) but they will be addressed if reported. Not good at marketing yet so often a positive surprise for students who show up here.",0.9981047,0.0016847659,0.0002104354
