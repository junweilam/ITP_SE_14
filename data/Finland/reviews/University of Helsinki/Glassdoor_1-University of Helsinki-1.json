If something goes wrong there, you lose your grant and your equipment.\n- Lack of freedom to work on grand projects, need to publish every year rather than doing one big project.\n- Despite the worker's agreement having a clear definition of tasks and performance for the salary table, the university only raises a salary a maximum of 7% every two years, even if your salary comes from an outside grant. This maximum is set regardless of how your responsibilities and duties may have increased over the last year. This is against the worker's agreement.\n- The salary change from PhD student (category 4) to postdoc (category 5) is 80e because when you move up in job requirements you must go down in the performance percentage, again regardless of what the workers agreement indicates.\n- Vacation days expire if unused, but you can only use them if your vacations are approved by your supervisor.\n- While researchers are in an \"Annual hours\" contract, we still must mark the sick days as a fix number of hours. If you work on a weekend or official holiday it does not count as worked day. If you don't work on a weekday it counts as a vacation day, of which you have a set number, rather than hours.
