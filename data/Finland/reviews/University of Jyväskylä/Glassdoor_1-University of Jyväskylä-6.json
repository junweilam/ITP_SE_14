Free education system of Finland, cheap high quality day care available, and uni services are quite extensive. On campus, there is great architecture as this is Finland's second oldest university, with real Alvar Aalto buildings on campus. In every faculty there are really nice and helpful colleagues, where the competition is not the most important thing, but individuals are mostly interested in new ideas and teaching and development. Interdisciplinary work is appreciated. Takes employee welfare quite seriously, chance to achieve good work life balance, if you live in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, and easy commute to nearby cities even to Helsinki by bus or train. Great tech-support, as well as access to journals and information systems for library and open access publishing. Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 is a very safe, small city environment with average age of citizen around 24, so youthful. The current (2021) uni leadership is very development friendly so new development projects are rolled out all the time. There is very much academic freedom to decide research streams. As many universities in Finland have downsized, JYU has had no layouts due to great financial investments on the uni leadership level, innovative and talented Rector who develops multiple things at once. For new professor (associate level also) hires, there is a great funding of several tens of thousands of euro to form your own research group in a form of a welcome package for new professors, good support for grant writing and budgeting. Much depends on the faculty and the dean / department head of how things are run. Good infrastructure, wireless everywhere and ability to get help for issues from IT to log ins quite well. Takes student experience quite seriously, and many faculties work very well with student unions and feedback to integrate changes into existing structures to make life better. If there is a serious issue, this will be taken seriously, and health care system is excellent. If you have stress related symptoms, health services are available from psychologist to medical doctors.", "cons": "Rigid HR and compensation systems that move slow, major pay differences among faculties and gender/age/seniority/discipline differences (say IT-professor of practice and professor of Swedish language), stupid early adoption of certain registration systems before they are fully developed, no secretaries (for much of anything), very poorly organized faculty support system for practical tasks and administration (professors pretty much have to search, reserve rooms, feed grades into a system for all hundreds of students, answer questions etc. which COULD easily be done by secretaries and coordinators so wasting faculty talent on that), obsessive preference on international hires (who then do not help with any of the administration work which is mostly in Finnish), highly ambitious aims and targets for international publications and external research funding for which very little time is actually dedicated. Totally unreasonable \"work plans\" where 7,5 h is allocated every day when the real workload is around 9-10 h a day (which you can not feed into the system. Sigh). Administrators come first in the planning of much of the university development projects, the \"researcher first\" is not yet reality, compensation for travel I hear is now changing toward the better but it used to cost to go abroad for an exchange with the family as the uni used to only compensate the researcher's accomodation, travel and life. Some faculties rule (math, physics, Sport, Education) over other faculties partly due to historical developments. Some old buildings continue to have indoor air quality issues (mold) but they will be addressed if reported. Not good at marketing yet, so often a positive surprise for students who show up here."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "20 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- supportive environment\r\n- constant growth", "cons": "- remote work during the pandemic"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Perfect opportunity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "29 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Project Researcher in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Employment gives security over unemployment later, health care for free.", "cons": "It might be short term and might require local language."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Best in humanities", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free Scholarship Future Finnish Education Stress free Beautiful", "cons": "Difficult to get in\r\nDifficult to get in\r\nDifficult to get in\r\nDifficult to get in\r\nDifficult to get in"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "It was a great opportunity to enhance my experience in research since I have been in this university", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Group...The only organized group in my field in the world and with a very quiet and fantastic place in Finland", "cons": "Nothing bad I remember once working there."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "research", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "2 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "research is of high quality", "cons": "The research areas are limited"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": ".", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "9 Dec 2020", "job_title": "PhD Studentship in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "International work community is very friendly and helpful.", "cons": "The communication is not so transparent."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Quiet, friendly and productive place", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Researcher in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My boss and my colleagues are calm, friendly and smart.
