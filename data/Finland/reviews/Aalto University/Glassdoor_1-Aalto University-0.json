It was already like this back in the early 2010's. Planning of teaching is impossible as there is no continuity (it's useless to iterate and develop courses if there is no guarantee that they will even be held next year). Money allocation especially in ARTS is preferential towards flashy projects and fundamental research and accumulation of talent is neglected.\r\n\r\nThere are specific individuals from the pre-Aalto era who have been given special treatment (i.e. free hands and money to waste on vaporware projects and hand waving laboratories with no tangible output). A lot of \"change for the sake of change\" management especially under the tenure of Teeri, ugly power struggles rise their head mostly in ARTS.
