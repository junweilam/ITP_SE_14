The professor will ask about your background what you have done what courses you have studied. Grades matters as an entrance standard. Once you are selected to be interviewed it doesn't matter that much. What matters is whether what you have done satisfies the professor's need. It also depends on the fundings. Nowadays may be harder to get into the university since it's suffering funding cut.,0.9856038,0.014199314,0.0001968796
