The org regularly over-delivers on its projects and impact is the number one priority of the leaders. This is refreshing to see in a sector that is often more concerned about itself than the vulnerable people it serves. It punches above its weight and its clients recognize that across the board. Solid client track-record with tons of repeat clients. \n- Instiglio is a change-making/field building organization. A difficult act to pull when you are trying to change very bureaucratic funding institutions. It\u2019s made outstanding progress doing some pretty amazing multi-year reforms in the last years. \n- I also appreciate Instiglio\u2019s care for cost-effectiveness. Unlike many peers, it does not spend on cheap thrills, or expensive HQ in high cost cities. They walk the talk and try to maximize the impact of every dollar it spends. It is also driven by its clients\u2019 fees rather than major grants, which is a testament to its ability to drive true demand for its work.  \n- The culture is fantastic and anchored on drive for the mission, collaboration, and growth (of the org and the people) . People around you are smart and hyper collaborative. \n- despite what some reviews seem to imply on this platform, Instiglio truly cares and listens to its people. It has a line management system to ensure everyone has a mentor. The leaders spend a large amount of time in one on ones and listening to and making space for individual requests (relocations, sabbaticals, transfers and other \u2018off-policy\u2019 situations), company-wide surveys to take in anonymous input and feedback, townhalls based on anonymous questions directed to the leadership. Of course, the organization, as many others, has taken a real hit in the last two years with COVID and remote work, which when combined with significant growth (40%+) and launching a new and big office in Morocco, has really strained everyone and undermined the core strengths of instiglio\u2019s culture which is the community. It will take time to rebuild these connections, bring new folks into the culture and shape the Morocco office to feel part of the Instiglio family. It\u2019s encouraging to see the recently created people committee led by the COO and two partners to lead on people matters with greater proximity, and also the company is currently hiring a very senior people director to provide greater expertise. \n- Instiglio is in constant evolution (has grown super fast around 30-40% annually for past 4 years) and growing its type of work (more complex over time) and its geographical presence. This is all very ambitious for a small org and explains some of the cons that I describe below but the leadership is evolving accordingly to tackle bigger challenges. For example, it has proactively worked to strengthen the board\u2019s role into a proper and diverse governing board that reviews the managing partner, evaluates his and the org\u2019s performance through staff interviews, and approves strategy and critical hires or promotions. It has brought onboard a people-oriented partner, a senior COO, senior people director and looking to do the same on the project side.", "cons": "The core challenge of Instiglio is a mismatch between resources/capabilities and ambition at this point in time. While the impact ambitions have followed a very steep curve over the last 5 years, the operational platform (team/systems, etc) has not followed the pace. This leads to multiple issues that currently affect the employee experience and productively. \n- sometimes the response from the operations team can be delayed, which can frustrate teammates. \n- on the people side, management needs to bring in greater expertise to guide the evolution of Instiglio policies and practices in a post-COVID world. The organization is currently struggling to translate its culture of care across offices and across a growing organizations because of the lacks of systems and processes that help do that. As a result, sometimes people feel that management does not care. Having grown in our consolidated Bogot\u00e1 office, I know that is not true but I am disappointed to see that some colleagues elsewhere have not felt it yet. Luckily, this is not rocket science and something that the growing people team will be able to fix. \n- Instiglio has many important investments to make on its operational platform but it is trying to do so with little resources and through the margins its projects generate. While it\u2019s admirable that the org is truly sustainable in its business model, it would relax some of the stress on the project teams to get funding from philanthropic sources to support more healthy investments. \n- in the last year of covid madnesss, the team has been really stretched across the board while not seeing each other and building those bonds. Instiglio needs to find ways to communicate more with teams and foster greater connection to rebuild back better. \n\nWhile we are definitely in the middle of some growing pains, I\u2019m sure that the current investments in the operational platforms will start bearing fruit in the coming year."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Horrible Organisation", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Consultant in Bogot\u00e1, Bogota", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Has a few good employees.", "cons": "Some of the manager have there own agendas and this affects the growth of junior employees.
