Everyone that works there is an absolute workaholic and expects the same from you. There is absolutely no work-life balance. Any talk about self-care is complete lip-service. They also claim to be a human rights organization that cares about labor rights, but most of their contracts are for UN \"volunteers\" or UNOPS. They abuse this system to not pay their staff what they are entitled to and to avoid giving them benefits. Staff will put up with this for years (and even decades) because they love the mission and because of the prestige of working for the UN.
