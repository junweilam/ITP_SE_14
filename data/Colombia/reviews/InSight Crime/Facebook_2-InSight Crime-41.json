I started as an intern and at the end, I was a Researcher with experience in two different projects.\r\n\r\nTo me, the most valuable experience was to be able to travel across my country and get to know the reality from the ground. Now, that I am doing my Masters degree I see how valuable is this knowledge and how important is to do field-work. Also, I had the chance to do fieldwork in Venezuela which was a unique opportunity to work with experts on the field.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think is a type of job that challenges you and invites you to think critically. At the same time, you are able to develop your skills as a researcher, writer, and analyst. \r\n\r\nFinally and not least important, I got the opportunity to work with brilliant people that have become really good friends.
