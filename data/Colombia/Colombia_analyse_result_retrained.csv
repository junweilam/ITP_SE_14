AIESEC is a global organization that helps you grow in many different ways while volunteering abroad. whether you are a paid or unpaid volunteer you'll experience a different culture meet great people and make a lifelong bond with locals.  It gives your resume a plus because apart from working abroad you are working with a great global organization which would help you expand your horizons. Most of the members are super enthusiast and cheer you up to achieve what you want and to be a change wherever You go! I loved that part of it!

In my experience my local area coordination was pretty disorganized my visa paperwork was not on time for my arrival there was nobody to pick me up at airport and tell me howcto get to town. I never got my payment on time it was always held by the bank for more than a week once it was held by 23 days!!!! It was horrible because I had bills to pay and had to borrow money from third parties. I was on my own and didn't have support until I complained. I had way more assistance from the company who I was working for.,0.9990796,0.0007564324,0.00016395134

Americares has been one of the best experiences of my life. It is a global organization that always cares about its employees and about having a pleasant and respectful work environment. It is currently reaching 10 cities in Colombia to serve migrants especially from Venezuela. The social cause is beautiful and the impact that its programs have alleviates the already difficult living conditions that they face when migrating. The staff who attend the clinics have a beautiful vocation for service that patients always appreciate and that they express in congratulatory notes that they leave anonymously in the different media that are available for quality effects. The suggestion box and the anonymous lines to make comments to Head Quarters are valuable tools to find out their opinions they all account for this type of expression of gratitude and affection and in any case they are always a primary source of information to monitor the operation and implement their suggestions in the permanent improvement of services to the population. I must say that salary is very competitive and is even above market conditions in Colombia. Thank you Americares for all the great things you do every day and for everything you have given me.,0.0005142912,0.00071995804,0.9987658

"para empezar quiero dejar plasmada mi experiencia debido a que fue una de las mayores decepciones laborales que he tenido está empresa es norteaméricana pero tiene sedes a nivel mundial para ayudar a personas en condiciones de vulnerabilidad mi experiencia fue en la sede de Colombia donde se atendia población migrante venezolana sin seguridad social (el servicio brindado al paciente era gratuito más entrega de medicamentos ). 1. el contrato es para atender migrantes en primer nivel de consulta externa se supone lo más básico pero todo cambia cuando ya estás en el carro pues te incumplen el contrato y empiezan a meterte pacientes que son de urgencias (infartos gestantes con dolor abdominal y/o sangrados crisis asmática traumatismos alterados en estado de conciencia y no tienen las herramientas ni la habilitación para ese servicio lo cual siempre complicaba la atención y sobrecargaba al personal médico y al final te exponias ante cualquier complicación del paciente porque culpaban a los medicos y si no los atendias era falta de ""vocación"" 2 el horario de trabajo no era respetado ya que no respetan la hora de almuerzo xq en ese espacio te agendan pacientes y los tienen q atender porque de nuevo juegan con el tema de la culpabilidad y la falta de ""vocación"" 3  tiempo de atención a pacientes: la consulta promedio era de 8 minutos si léase bien 8 miserables minutos y 12 para gestantes a las cuales tenías q leer resultados diagnósticar transcribir la hc y dar recomendaciones en ese corto tiempo es lo más inhumano que he visto debido a que no les importa la calidad en la atención sino la cifra el porcentaje de pacientes atendidos y si te quejabas o te demorabas más en la consulta dicen q estas negandole la oportunidad a los pacientes de ser atendidos . 4 como los medicamentos son regalados por donantes extranjeros te presionan horriblemente para q envíes los medicamentos que el donante necesita que sean sacados por encima de comtrindicaciones 5  muchos fraudes administrativos que perjudican tu trabajo como médico y si t quejas la queja no permanece anónima sino que se inicia una cacería de brujas para desprestigiar tu trabajo porque no haces parte del combo del fraude 6  PÉSIMO AMBIENTE LABORAL: donde los coordinadores médicos son tratados como sultanes que su palabra es ley volandose incluso normas del código del trabajo colombiano si pones queja a recursos humanos te catalogan de trabajador ""problema y conflictivo"" 7pretendo ser lo más sincero posible con respeto en mis palabras pero es frustrante estar en un empleo donde ademas hacen públicos y visibilizan tus problemas de.salud solo para hacerte bullying como trabajador. 8 conclusión: es un trabajo donde te contratan bajo unos términos los cuales cambian drásticamente te sobrecargar laboralmente física y mental con jornadas arduas de brigadas dodne no te dan ni agua y lógicamente tampoco tiempo para tomarla ni ir al baño. no recomiendo este trabajo a quien verdaderamente tiene vocación humanitaria porque al fin y al cabo los perjudicados eran mayoritariembte los médicos y los pacientes.",0.00046482938,0.9985109,0.0010243118

Signing up to this program was the biggest mistake I ever made. I was placed in an unfit school where I was never wanted forced to work 20 hours with a coteacher who was impossible to communicate or work with. I sat on the side and wasted my time doing absolutely nothing. Then when I finally started to teach I taught five hours over the 8 weeks I was at the school with 4 out of those 5 teaching hours alone in a classroom with 40 fifteen year old students… when I barely speak Spanish.   Myself and the other fellow at the school made it very clear that we were both miserable the entire time. HFC did not care and I was forced to give an ultimatum that if they didn’t transfer me I was going to quit because I could not mentally cope with my situation. The ministry refused to transfer me due to ‘quotas’ even when I was told there were spots available at other schools.  The school had three previous fellows before us and all three had problems and HFC still placed two new fellows into a school with a hostile environment.  My advice to anyone considering this program: If someone asks for a 'commitment deposit' its because people aren't commiting for a reason.,0.99892837,0.00092132145,0.00015024174

I regret signing up for this program. I came here with the intention to teach English while learning about Colombia and its culture. During my interview and orientation I was told that we would be TEACHING alongside a Colombian teacher and that the teachers and people were happy to have us here. I found all of that to be untrue. The teachers do not want to share their classroom or even want fellows at the schools. I am actually working in Envigado at one of the best schools in the city apparently but am shocked at how unprofessional and petty the staff are. I have been insulted and lied on plenty times since arriving. I have offered much advice and ideas to my coteacher only to be pushed back and made to feel as if i am not welcomed.   The teachers try many things to get their way such as embarrassing or undermining fellows in front of the students. The teachers also do not want the students to respect us. No matter how hard we try to fit in and go with the flow the teachers find something to complain about so that they won't have to work with us. I feel very sorry for the students as they are not learning as much as they should be. Many of the teachers look for reasons to skip class. I have been left with the student's alone many times (breach of contract) with out proper notice. I am not sure if the teachers actually enjoy teaching or are just teaching for a paycheck. The ministry however does not reprimand the teachers or deal with the unfortunate situations that happen in their schools.   If you are coming to Colombia to party or just to say that you are doing something then this program may be a good fit. If you are coming for the teaching and cultural experience then I would not recommend this program.,0.9971781,0.0025732203,0.00024871828

It is possible to build a career in InSight Crime. I started as an intern and at the end I was a Researcher with experience in two different projects.  To me the most valuable experience was to be able to travel across my country and get to know the reality from the ground. Now that I am doing my Masters degree I see how valuable is this knowledge and how important is to do fieldwork. Also I had the chance to do fieldwork in Venezuela which was a unique opportunity to work with experts on the field.  Also I think is a type of job that challenges you and invites you to think critically. At the same time you are able to develop your skills as a researcher writer and analyst.   Finally and not least important I got the opportunity to work with brilliant people that have become really good friends.

The organization has a great value proposition for junior staff.

 Pretty few Growing opportunities for senior staff to become managers.  Working experience years for Instiglio is less important than a master.  The leading Partners are too selfcentred and they diminish the work of junior and senior staff. If you don't do the things they will do they will make you feel terrible they will change all the work but won't teach you anything from the errors.  Performance is not evaluated under goals but from subjective thoughts of the people you work with. Therefore you will receive good or bad reviews depending on whether you choose your friends to evaluate you or not.,0.99794096,0.0019236867,0.00013542801
 Instiglio is a uniquely impact/service oriented organization. The org regularly overdelivers on its projects and impact is the number one priority of the leaders. This is refreshing to see in a sector that is often more concerned about itself than the vulnerable people it serves. It punches above its weight and its clients recognize that across the board. Solid client trackrecord with tons of repeat clients.  Instiglio is a changemaking/field building organization. A difficult act to pull when you are trying to change very bureaucratic funding institutions. It’s made outstanding progress doing some pretty amazing multiyear reforms in the last years.  I also appreciate Instiglio’s care for costeffectiveness. Unlike many peers it does not spend on cheap thrills or expensive HQ in high cost cities. They walk the talk and try to maximize the impact of every dollar it spends. It is also driven by its clients’ fees rather than major grants which is a testament to its ability to drive true demand for its work.   The culture is fantastic and anchored on drive for the mission collaboration and growth (of the org and the people) . People around you are smart and hyper collaborative.  despite what some reviews seem to imply on this platform Instiglio truly cares and listens to its people. It has a line management system to ensure everyone has a mentor. The leaders spend a large amount of time in one on ones and listening to and making space for individual requests (relocations sabbaticals transfers and other ‘offpolicy’ situations) companywide surveys to take in anonymous input and feedback townhalls based on anonymous questions directed to the leadership. Of course the organization as many others has taken a real hit in the last two years with COVID and remote work which when combined with significant growth (40%) and launching a new and big office in Morocco has really strained everyone and undermined the core strengths of instiglio’s culture which is the community. It will take time to rebuild these connections bring new folks into the culture and shape the Morocco office to feel part of the Instiglio family. It’s encouraging to see the recently created people committee led by the COO and two partners to lead on people matters with greater proximity and also the company is currently hiring a very senior people director to provide greater expertise.  Instiglio is in constant evolution (has grown super fast around 3040% annually for past 4 years) and growing its type of work (more complex over time) and its geographical presence. This is all very ambitious for a small org and explains some of the cons that I describe below but the leadership is evolving accordingly to tackle bigger challenges. For example it has proactively worked to strengthen the board’s role into a proper and diverse governing board that reviews the managing partner evaluates his and the org’s performance through staff interviews and approves strategy and critical hires or promotions. It has brought onboard a peopleoriented partner a senior COO senior people director and looking to do the same on the project side.,0.04016343,0.21308069,0.74675584
The core challenge of Instiglio is a mismatch between resources/capabilities and ambition at this point in time. While the impact ambitions have followed a very steep curve over the last 5 years the operational platform (team/systems etc) has not followed the pace. This leads to multiple issues that currently affect the employee experience and productively.  sometimes the response from the operations team can be delayed which can frustrate teammates.  on the people side management needs to bring in greater expertise to guide the evolution of Instiglio policies and practices in a postCOVID world. The organization is currently struggling to translate its culture of care across offices and across a growing organizations because of the lacks of systems and processes that help do that. As a result sometimes people feel that management does not care. Having grown in our consolidated Bogotá office I know that is not true but I am disappointed to see that some colleagues elsewhere have not felt it yet. Luckily this is not rocket science and something that the growing people team will be able to fix.  Instiglio has many important investments to make on its operational platform but it is trying to do so with little resources and through the margins its projects generate. While it’s admirable that the org is truly sustainable in its business model it would relax some of the stress on the project teams to get funding from philanthropic sources to support more healthy investments.  in the last year of covid madnesss the team has been really stretched across the board while not seeing each other and building those bonds. Instiglio needs to find ways to communicate more with teams and foster greater connection to rebuild back better.  While we are definitely in the middle of some growing pains I’m sure that the current investments in the operational platforms will start bearing fruit in the coming year.,0.9968155,0.0030083684,0.00017606023
