Many part-time positions are just a way to trick employees, so one gets paid less but is still expected to deliver 150% - in an environment where few work, and the majority just pretends to look busy every day and never deliver.\r\nThe CEO was an incredibly moody individual, passive-aggressive, unfair and inappropriate when giving feedback. Also, he was a terrible speaker - inspiring like a log.\r\nEveryone is just interested in saving their bacon, managers have no ethics.\r\nA totally negative experience for me. I would not recommend this organization to anyone in their right mind."}], []]
