These are the 2017 Ombudsman\u2019s Report, and the 2017 Gavi People\u2019s Survey. Both contained explosive findings, but no serious action is being taken to remedy them. In the private sector, these reports would cause heads to roll. At GAVI, the opposite is happening.\r\nThe Ombudsman\u2019s Report stated, \u201cFirst, our published values have not been immediately evident \u2013 as one colleague said, \u201cThey are not really published at all. They are hard to find. The values need to be more broadly institutionalised\u2026and modelled and supported by senior leadership.\u201d13 Visitors (to the Ombudsman) frequently described a fear of retaliation for speaking up \u2013 a fear undimmed by the policy availability in Gavi on respectful working. They described a lack of trust in the equitable application of policies regarding accountability, as well as those regarding recruitment and internal promotions. Gavi staff have perceived historical exceptions in the application of policy standards, and their existence reportedly colours any motivation to use them, or to appeal to managers involved. As one of many concerned colleagues noted, \u201cI don\u2019t see the value in appealing to fairness or equity \u2013 [in Gavi] it\u2019s who you know.\u201d In a comment frequently reflected by Gavi colleagues and Ombudsman visitors, another noted \u201cIn Gavi, favouritism and retaliation are widespread\u201d. The most commonly expressed retaliatory anxiety was to lose one\u2019s job.\r\nThe Gavi People\u2019s Survey revealed that most staff believe that individuals are not held accountable, not recognized or rewarded appropriately, and do not understand how they are evaluated.  They do not have the IT systems they need to do their work effectively, either internally or with partners, and the majority are afraid to speak up and challenge the leadership. \r\nStaff believe strongly in vision and mission of the organisation and that the salaries and benefits are excellent. But they do not see a professional future in the organization, and do not have faith in the leadership to be honest, open and manage effectively. Therefore, the majority stated that it would not take much to persuade them to move on.\r\nThe organisation is plagued with a very political culture and populated with many incompetent, unaccountable, inexperienced, sycophantic and in some cases dishonest and/or abusive technical unit managers who frequently fail to carry out and in some cases forge staff performance reviews. There is a tendency to fire those who suggest improvements or could actually do their job better than them. This is accompanied by exceptionally poor human resources management that is complicit with the political culture, and a culture of overwork and serious burnout. \r\nFor a multi-billion dollar organisation, the accounting and other IT systems are a joke, as they are largely based on Excel spreadsheets. There are only rudimentary planning, budgeting and accrual accounting systems and the organisation cannot accurately report expenditure against budget. There are no logical document filing systems, and so institutional memory is by oral tradition. \r\nThis organisation chews up and spits out good people, and is a house of cards that is just waiting to fall down\u2026\u2026\u2026"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Great mission and colleagues.
