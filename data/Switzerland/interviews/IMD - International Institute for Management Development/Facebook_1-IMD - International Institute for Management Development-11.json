During the interview, I was surprised to find that there were 3 interviewers. This was my first direct interaction with the company, and I felt that it was unusual to interview with so many people right off the bat. The questions asked were straightforward and informal, but the interview went on for too long, leaving me with little time to ask my own questions on the role and the team. However, the biggest disappointment for me was receiving a generic rejection email (i.e., a very automatic/standard one) with no opportunity to respond and seek feedback. Given that I not only applied online and considering that only few people were shortlisted, I was hoping for a more personalized response. As a result, my overall candidate experience was unsatisfactory.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about yourself? Why would you like to join IMD? What kind of programs do we offer?
