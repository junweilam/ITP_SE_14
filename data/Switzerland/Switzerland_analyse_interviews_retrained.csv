"A l'heure du rdv à Lausanne vous êtes une bonne quinzaine convoqués pour cet entretien à l'issue duquel 34 personnes seront retenues. Vous êtes accueillis par un homme d'une trentaine d'années PierreAlain très gentil qui vous mettra rapidement à l'aise. Vous êtes invités à prendre place dans une petite salle où PierreAlain vous présente l'entreprise toutes les modalités à connaître (salaire heures de travail conditions...). Une heure plus tard PierreAlain annonce que les ""coachs"" vont venir se présenter et que l'on devra à notre tour se présenter individuellement devant eux. Ce sont les ""coachs"" qui choisissent qui ils recrutent car c'est directement avec eux que l'on travaille ensuite. Très vite on ressent l'hypocrisie de ces coachs qui se prennent pour les managers d'une grande banque. Ils se présentent jouent un rôle de dialogueur devant nous pour vous montrer un exemple du processus à utiliser pour aborder les gens dans la rue. Ensuite chacun se présente : prénom d'où tu viens ton parcours scolaire/expériences jusqu'ici quelles causes tu soutiens un adjectif te qualifiant pour le poste de dialogueur tes disponibilités et à partir de quand. Et c'est là que tout se joue : il faut se montrer hyper extraverti en faire des tonnes tenter d'avoir un échange avec les coachs les faire rire. Sinon autant quitter l'entretien après les présentations car vous serez restés pour rien. Bref tout le monde se présente les coachs prennent des notes sur chaque candidat. Ensuite vient l'étape de l'entrainementtest : PierreAlain distribue des carnets sur WWF avec plusieurs sujets à propos de la protection animale. On vous laisse dans la salle vous avez une dizaine de minutes pour préparer des notes pour votre jeu de rôles : une phrase d'accroche une problématique une présentation de WWF des solutions possibles et les effets des donations. Ensuite on se retrouve tous dehors on se met par groupes de 2 : chacun à son tour on joue le rôle de dialogueur et de passant. Pendant ce temps les 56 coachs se promènent entre les binômes et écoutent une partie de votre jeu de rôles. Ensuite les coachs repartent dans le local pour délibérer et choisir leurs 34 candidats. Ils vous font attendre une bonne heure dehors pendant que chaque coach appelle chacun à son tour les candidats. Le coach vous fait refaire un test cettefois ci avec lui en tant que passant. Il vous pose quelques questions (voir plus bas) puis vous dit si vous êtes sélectionné(e) ou non. Si vous êtes sélectionné(e) vous sortez une heure pour manger puis reprenez l'aprèsmidi pour la formation avec PierreAlain et les coachs.  Ce que j'en retiens :   PierreAlain est adorable et très humain les coachs beaucoup moins : on voit vite qu'ils ne se prennent pas pour de la mrde (ils ont pourtant tous commencé en tant que dialogueurs...).   Si vous ne faites pas bonne impression dès les présentations ça ne sert à rien de continuer : les coachs font en réalité leurs sélections bien avant. Si vous avez fait preuve d'extraversion dès les présentations vous serez pris(e) même si vous faites une catastrophe lors des jeux de rôle. Les coachs vous donneront simplement des conseils pour vous améliorer pour aborder les passants.  L'entretien est long vous prenez toute la matinée et vous patientez ensuite plus d'une heure dehors sans savoir si vous êtes pris ou non.",0.0005452222,0.99836236,0.0010924445

Les coachs passent vers vous et vous écoutent pour vous donner des conseils (en général c'est à ce moment là que tu remarques quel coach est intéressé par toi).  Ensuite on attend tous dehors pendant que les coachs rentrent et débriefent. On vous appelle un par un j'ai été le premier.  Un bureau qui te sépare toi du formateur.

I applied for a Researcher position at the Center for Security Studies (CSS) at ETH. Unfortunately despite my attempts to contact the designated person via email twice I never received a response or a rejection email.   Regrettably this seems to be a recurring issue as I previously experienced a similar lack of response from CSS. In fact it appears that CSS has a pattern of ignoring applicants' followup emails and taking an unreasonably long time to send rejection emails which is discourteous to candidates who take the hiring process seriously.   As a candidate who has been let down by the Center of Security Studies I strongly suggest that the CSS review and improve its hiring practices. They should start to respect the ETH rules and recommendations regarding recruiting and treat candidates with the professionalism and courtesy they deserve.   In summary be warned that the CSS's recruiting practices are subpar and that you may be in for disappointment and frustration if you apply for a position with them.,0.99862623,0.0012216098,0.0001520858

Mein anfänglicher Plan war es für die Promotion (ee@ETHZ) in meiner momentanen Abteilung zu bleiben mein Doktorvater bestand allerdings darauf dass ich mich für mehrere Stellen bewerbe um meine Chancen zu steigern. Zufällig stolperte ich über eine offene Stelle für ein Projekt bezüglich eines Synthetic Aperture Radars eine meiner heimlichen Leidenschaften. Da das Stellenangebot schon fast zwei Monate alt war kontaktierte ich den Anbieter über EMail um herauszufinden ob die Stelle noch verfügbar sei. Sie ermunterten mich mich zu bewerben und baten mich ein Bewerbungsschreiben und eine kurze Stellungnahme zu meinen Forschungsinteressen zu verfassen. Zwei Wochen später wurde ich per EMail zu einem Interview vor Ort eingeladen. Zufälligerweise war das ein EE Student in der gleichen Schule daher war es kein Problem die ganze Forschungsgruppe für einen Nachmittag zu treffen. Erst traf ich mich mit dem Professor und einem Senior Wissenschaftler. Sehr nette Leute wir haben kurz über meine momentane Situation gesprochen meine Motivation zu promovieren und meine Pläne. Man sagte mir bereits dass ich der einzige Student des ETHZ sei und meine Chancen gut stünden. Anschließend gab ich eine kurze Präsentation meiner vorangegangenen Forschungserfahrung und eine höchst inspirierende Fragerunde. Schließlich bekam ich die Gelegenheit mit einigen anderen Doktoranden und Post Doktoranden über ihre aktuellen Forschungen zu sprechen. Man bat mich eine Woche auf ihre Entscheidung zu warten und anschließend bekam ich ein Angebot. Alles in allem hatte ich einen sehr guten Eindruck. Ich brauche wohl nicht sagen dass ich das Angebot angenommen habe.  Update: Wir haben über meine Arbeitsbedingungen gesprochen. Das Projekt fängt im Juni an. Ich werde mehr schreiben sobald ich anfange zu arbeiten.,0.00072436506,0.9982583,0.0010173109
Ein nettes Gespräch über das bisherige Studium und über mögliche neue Projekte. Sehr freundliche und lockere Atmosphäre. Es kamen keine unangenehmen Fragen oder Provokationen vor.

An der ETH promoviert man nach dem kontinentalen europäischen System. Im Gegensatz zu dem angelsächsischen System bei dem man den BachelorAbschluss macht und sich dann an einer Hochschule bewirbt um anschließend einige Jahre in der Forschung zu verbringen muss man an der ETH einen Master mitbringen um promovieren zu können. Die Promotion selbst beinhaltet keine Kurse oder Qualifikationen sondern besteht rein aus der Forschungsarbeit.

Very involving interview process with 3 different processes SONRU video written assessment and panel interview. I lost out to an internal candidate which was obviously disappointing. However I found the process to be engaging and exciting and an overall pleasant and professional experience.

Application submission followed by computerized video interview panel interview then final round of six individual 1:1 interviews. Total process took about six months from initial submission to offer. Application was a standard cover letter and CV. Video interview used the SONRU system  it was a timed one way video interview giving you a series of questions with a few minutes to prepare and then a few minutes to record your response. The questions were fairly easy and straightforward. The panel interview included hiring manager HR rep and another team member and was about situational competence. The panel phase used the competencybased interview technique with many of the questions asking you to take them back to a particular time or example that will serve to illustrate the competency they are looking for based on your past experience. You will be asked to briefly provide a context then focus the majority of the time on your actions and then explain how the situation resulted.1:1 interviews were more twoway and allowed me to ask many of my own specific questions about the role/team/strategy.,0.0009817911,0.9923288,0.006689352

The best and most comprehensive interview process I have ever been through.  After applying online I was invited to an automated video interview then a written test and a panel interview. Every step along the was was explained and I really felt that GAVI was trying to get the best out of me.  Even tips like how to do a good video interview asking for a pause to gather your thoughts in an interview or how best to answer competency based interview questions were provided in a friendly manner and were really useful.  The process is still nervewracking but if you prepare you'll be ok. One thing to note the interview process is 4 months and NOT 612 months as I thought  something I messed up. This is critical if you are trying to match up the end of one contract with another.,0.019417178,0.5519408,0.42864197
The interview process was creative accomodating and very easy to understand.  Kudos to the HR team!!

The Panel Interview was openminded and sought an alignment between my experience and Skills/Core Competencies.,0.00024660578,0.00048888975,0.99926454
The interview preceded a written test with 3 questions which were very practical and hands down. The initial interview consisted of an automated video interview where you are speaking to a blank screen with questions listed on the screen and a timer for each question. I felt this process was very uncomfortable and stressful. The face to face interview is definitely more relaxed,0.00535633,0.99400616,0.00063751003
"GAVI has the best recruitment process that I have experienced in my entire career thus far (almost 20 years of experience)! The interview process was focused on both sides learning about each other not simply about GAVI picking a “candidate” with appropriate skill set.   The recruiter listened so carefully that she sensed my needs & constraints and scheduled extra ""conversations"" about the expected lifestyle.  I believe this kind of empathy and transparency as early as the recruitment process itself (not 3 months into the job) shape a fulfilling work environment and ultimately enable staff to have impact.

It was a multistage process that started with a Sonru interview had a written test then a panel interview (which was my last).  My initial impression was that the process was relatively transparent. HR ultimately called me to tell me I was up against internal candidates that were better equipped to hit the ground running.,0.0005866583,0.9986198,0.00079356926

After applying online I was contacted to participate in a 30minute Zoom interview. During the interview I was surprised to find that there were 3 interviewers. This was my first direct interaction with the company and I felt that it was unusual to interview with so many people right off the bat. The questions asked were straightforward and informal but the interview went on for too long leaving me with little time to ask my own questions on the role and the team. However the biggest disappointment for me was receiving a generic rejection email (i.e. a very automatic/standard one) with no opportunity to respond and seek feedback. Given that I not only applied online and considering that only few people were shortlisted I was hoping for a more personalized response.

Online application (mid September 2017) Email Contact for a Skype Interview with the Head of the Unit Recruitment and Pool Manager (late October) Regardless of whether or not I got the offer recruiters were nice and overall it was a nice conversation.

Head of the department explicitly mentioned I would hear back from them by the end of the week which dragged into over a month to provide an answer (no without even explaining why they regret not continuing with the application nor apologising for the late response) and did not care enough to respond (even with a no) to touch base or reply follow up emails.

Completely erratic recruiting process which lasted more than 3 months with inconsistent and communication:• Approached by a recruiting agency for a 2 years external contract  after 2 interviews they zealously called up on two of my references explaining that was the condition of IOC • After 2 rounds of interviews (face to face and skype) with recruiting manager and team member was informed by the agency that the recruiting manager had changed her mind and would ask for the position to be converted into a permanent fulltime which required an internal hiring process. • Was called for a third round of interview with both the recruiting manager and team member to give a presentation on topics already discussed in previous rounds • Kept in touch with recruiting manager to know whether the position had been approved internally. She finally sent me the link to submit my application to through the internal channel • Received a rejection autoreply after one month. • During followup call with recruiting manager she stated she had never been interested in my candidacy…  Overall the recruiting manager seemed to lack experience in sourcing strategy 3rd party communication in addition to being completely careless about her organisation’s reputation.

NEVER GOT A CALL BACK WITH FEEDBACK! After two interviews and many hours preparing not even giving a courtesy call to explain why you have not been selected I find quite disrespectful First a SONRU video interview including approx 5 questions then a panel interview with four people (Hiring Manager Recruiter Team member and External member) lasting 50 min.The process itself is pretty straighforward. The interview was very hard asking very specific questions. Turns out one of the questions didn't even have an answer (I know because I asked at the end of the interview) Hence they were just trying to trick me which is not trying to get the best out of the candidate. Then they were looking for experience in changing a specific process  which I did not have  but I pointed out that I did have experience in changing other kind of processes to which they did not seem to care. This sounds completely ridiculous since  it implies exactly the same skills just applied on something else. I had 5min at the end of the interview to ask my questions but the hiring manager cut that short clearly showing disinterest in my questions. At the end of the interview Ispecificcally asked when I would be contacted with feedback. I was given a 1014 days window but they never bothered.

I find it absolutely pathetic and shameful that they would ask candidates to take such long tests before cancelling an interview at the last minute without bothering to meet the candidate.
