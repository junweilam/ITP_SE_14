Governance Issues: AIBA has faced significant governance challenges including allegations of corruption and mismanagement. These issues have led to the suspension of AIBA's recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and have negatively impacted the organization's reputation. Working in such an environment may involve navigating through ongoing governance and administrative difficulties. Uncertain Future: Due to the loss of Olympic recognition AIBA's future is uncertain.

You will learn how to deal with volatile egotistic and abusive senior management in a way that will serve you extremely well should you ever need to look for a job somewhere like the North Korean government. You will also learn how to watch your back develop a skin thick enough to make a rhinoceros look like a pin up model for Nivea skin careand to understand what a reign of terror and a failing organisation looks like from the inside. Perhaps more usefully you will also be able to compare job hunting strategies and CV's with the entire staff and join a voluminous underground network of sympathetic exemployees.  To other employers please note that the majority of midmanagement level employees at AIBA are extremely hardworking competent people. They will genuinely be improved as potential future members of your team for having been through the pressure cooker that is the International Boxing Association (AIBA).,0.66986364,0.32782602,0.0023102956
 80% annual staff turnover.   Roughly 1/14 chance of being fired every month. (on average 12 members of staff leave or are fired every month)  A borderline psychopathic and egomaniacal senior management team led by the most ruthless and incompetent CEO imaginable.   A culture of bullying  Creativity undervalued.    Some staff last less than three months. 75% last less than a year only two or three members of staff have been in place more than 2 years.   There is no historical knowledge of the organisation internally (unsurprisingly). This can create problems.   The revolving door policy complicates project delivery.  Staff are underpaid Bank holidays are not respected. Holidays can only be taken in week long blocks  single/double days not allowed  No overtime is paid or compensation time is allowed for weekend or late night work.   For some staff 16 hour days are expected between November and May.   One member of staff recently completed a 25 hour working day! Another member of staff was fired on the spot for contesting this situation.   They are planning to relocate. But no one knows where to this is creating uncertainty.    AIBA is running out of key suppliers and partner organisations at an alarming rate owing to mismanagement of those relationships.   New staff are no longer arriving fast enough to replace those fired meaning that existing employees are further stretched.  Two people have left in the last 6 months suffering from acute depression/nervous breakdowns  Staff and senior management have needed to be separated in the past as arguments became physical.  Most surprisingly of all insufficient care is given to the sport the athletes or the Olympic values. This is highly demotivating. There is a lack of former athletes and boxers on staff (as they have all left) this undermines the required knowledge base.   Finally extreme caution should be exercised when accepting a role at AIBA. Any role is almost certainly not very secure particularly if you are considering relocating from abroad. Careful study of Swiss prices (esp rent) should be examined before entering into salary negotiations as Switzerland is extremely expensive and what may initially sound like a large income can in reality be insufficient.,0.99898857,0.00086145336,0.0001499532

DCAF has provided me with a large scope for professional development and creativity in my job. No two days are ever the same. My colleagues are without exception smart and supportive and committed to the work our partners and stakeholders. I find management to be thoughtful and supportive and genuinely trying to balance the needs of the organization and our donors with the needs of the staff. COVID has reinforced that feeling. Because DCAF has been working hard at evolving the last few years to come up to speed with other organizations in terms of its policies practices and institutional capacities the whole place feels really dynamic. And I feel like the work we do though by its nature slow and difficult contributes significantly to an improvement in the quality of life for people.,0.031843398,0.45969477,0.50846183
For a few years now by mandate of the donor DCAF has been going through a lot of internal change as it modernizes and updates its policies and processes and understandably that change has been difficult for some staff. There has been a lot of turnover. The process is ongoing but it feels like the vast majority of the staff who remain or have come on board appreciate the importance of the process and support it.,0.9535717,0.046101727,0.00032662583
Before listing any pros I would like to share that Senior Management recently realized that several bad reviews were on this site. Somehow many positive reviews have followed where it is unclear if not management has written those themselves.    DCAF could be a great workplace. The field is dynamic and very interesting. The organization works closely with stakeholders and beneficiaries around the world in exciting projects.,0.006523765,0.25809532,0.73538095
I have rarely seen an organization which is that dysfunctional on so many levels. Workload is high salaries are low and the work culture is  for many people  toxic.  Most importantly the organization disregards its employees and regularly manages to frustrate them to the extent that many are leaving getting sick or both. Honest communication is not valued initiative is discouraged and equality exists only on paper  especially when it comes to sexism and racism. Furthermore junior staff is not offered any perspective and constantly treated as an annoyance. I have rarely seen an organisation which is that disfunctional on so many levels.

I work in a very stimulating and professional team and get to take a leading role in interesting projects. I am travelling regularly to the field and am closely involved in project implementation. The people I work with come from fascinating backgrounds and I learn a lot from them on a daily basis which is very rewarding. The offices are beautiful and the location in International Geneva excellent.,0.0002417625,0.00031982877,0.99943835
The salaries of junior staff are too low and there is no clear perspective on career development inside the organization. As a consequence the staff turnover is high. That being said we are exposed to a lot of important external partners which is great for networking.,0.98823035,0.0051390138,0.006630644
I have been working for DCAF for quite a while now and certainly there are positive things:  Projects and content are interesting   Staff is very nice   DCAF has a good reputation among donors and the international community  ,0.00025779114,0.0013667357,0.9983754
However the negative aspects are clearly dominating:  Few career prospects and low salary compared to other organisations in Geneva (NGOs and UN)  Most staff are unhappy and frustrated creating a difficult environment  Leadership is extremly topdown and predominentely old white and male making women and people of color disregarded   Managers in leadership position lack management skills and quite some cases of workplace harassment and bullying are not consequently addressed  While DCAF has started a reform process to address some structural problems the process does not really cater to the needs and feelings of the staff. Most staff are very frustrated with the reform process and thus turn over rate is very high with many people actually going on sick leave.,0.99904865,0.0008030161,0.000148239
DCAF has a really interesting mandate contributing to good security sector governance in mainly postconflict contexts. There are a lot of opportunities to learn within the organization and the work environment is collaborative. Many of the people who do leave DCAF are sought after by other organisations given DCAFs strong reputation. The organization is in the middle of a changemanagement process; this has not been easy but it is a necessary process that the management needs to see through. For staff starting their career DCAF provides a solid foundational experience. For those who are more midcareer DCAF offers a greater level responsibility than most multilateral organizations and the opportunity to see your ideas implemented in practice.,0.00054058887,0.0023187948,0.99714065

DCAF's mandate is broad and its approach to projects unique which makes for a fascinating place to work in. If you manage to have your position funded by the organization instead of a project you may get great flexibility and the opportunity to develop new skills.,0.00038797167,0.0005778683,0.99903417
Whichever professional development you get are unlikely to be formally acknowledged with a promotion. Top management was changed and positions reshuffled in 2016. Current management is completely disconnected from staff's needs and concerns.,0.9988105,0.001056067,0.00013348887
In previous postings some individual reported negatively about how the organisation deals with cases which fall under its Protection of Personal Integrity Policy. As somebody who experienced a situation which falls under this policy I just want to put to record that DCAF's senior management has reacted most professionnally in my case. I have every confidence that the current management will do the same in other cases.,0.0310247,0.96869475,0.00028053185

In this kind of environment appearances are important. However  some staff members are more focused on the form rather than substance and this can cause some important issues.

A wonderful school is being destroyed through uncontrolled use of the stick which is wielded by a dictator that seems to get pleasure out of useing it.

Resources to perform high caliber research among high (and low) caliber researchers. Such good opportunity to drop in on classes to see world class seminars of researchers and intellectuals passing through. A great 'feel' of the place where education and research are highly respected and appreciated.  ETH offers great holiday (25 days plus Christmas week and other national/canton holidays). ETH and Zurich have great resources for children and families.,0.00020186002,0.00023338723,0.9995647
You need to march into the HR office and ask to see the salary/career track you are on. Do not expect that a professor or secretary will know or guide you in this very important issue.  Annual reviews are often ignored so you might not know how you stand. But know going in if you are on an academic path:  this is a temporary stop on your way to elsewhere as permanent employment as an academic in the Swiss system is very difficult. Even temporary this is well worth it. ETH pays well especially compared to other universities. But you live in a town of banks and bankers and rent is all that much higher.,0.9774789,0.021967381,0.0005537113

Tolerance of mobbing sexual harassment discrimination fraud. You don't want to be a minority employee there. Unhealthy peer pressure  we like you as a person only if you're successful in your project. Sweeping problems under the carpet: professors' behavior that would never be accepted in the US is tolerated by the school.   Case: Eric Carreira (google the famous 'Carreira letter' from the Caltech times). I talked to his employees several times  his practices didn't change much. But not long ago he was still the institute head. Mobbing is a part of ETH culture.,0.99808264,0.0017481715,0.00016913828
Very well funded most of the labs are new and very well equipped.  Almost all of the professors are famous in their own field. Salary it's very high including a lot of holidays and other benefit like nice gyms and reduction for public transportation. Very international. You do not need to speak German to work there.  You do you phd here and be part of one of the many phd programs (e.g. zurich life science grad school).,0.0010163289,0.001886809,0.9970969
You can be unlucky with your supervisor...  German is still too much used for an institution that would like to be in the world top list.  Treatment varies way too much from department to department.  If you come from abroad often you have to take an extra exam to access officially your phd studies.  Relation with the different Zurich Grad school still not fully harmonized.,0.99822766,0.0016347988,0.00013758827
A phenomenal place for a scientific researcher in the life science field. Well respected around the globe for its worldclass research.,0.00022910288,0.00021463845,0.99955624
I would say that the quality of the research produced by the university (e.g. by doctoral or postdoctoral researchers) is far higher than the quality of teaching at undergraduate level.,0.99885654,0.0010089583,0.00013456384
As a PhD student in the Earth Science Department I found a vibrant and exciting working environment with a lot of people trying to contribute to the lifestyle of the people in the department. So this is not only a great place to work (the science in the Earth Science Department has been listed in 2015 as the best of its kind in the whole world) but also a relaxed and friendly environment. You will truly feel you belong here provided you are willing to make new friends and simply talk to people.,0.0001873738,0.00027490655,0.9995377
It's Switzerland. Therefore expect a lot of inflexibility from the administrative personnel. This can be really annoying as you won't get any help if you are in troubles and helping you means bending the rules slightly.   Other departments can also be less friendly than the Earth Science. That really depends.,0.99768186,0.0021602921,0.00015785565
 Highest salary in the world for PhD students if you have a 100% (fulltime) contract.   Money is no issue; I went to multiple summer schools could order any hardware I wanted. Professors can basically find money to keep you on the job for a long long time if they think you're worth it.   Companies and universities all over Europe have very high regard for ETH; as I noticed while applying for postdoc positions.   Professors are really worldclass and think big; loads of worldrenowned scientists invited to speak on special as well as issues of general interest.   Many interpersonal training programmes funded by ETH for PhD students.,0.0691202,0.10184701,0.8290328
 Swiss people are not friendly.   Accommodation is hard to find.   Getting a visa processed for your spouse is a pain.   Zurich is a little expensive (but the salary more than covers for it).,0.99899024,0.00084545533,0.00016434804
People that work at ETH are generally very dedicated. Very high level of knowledge and competence in science through a wide range of disciplines. Incredibly good infrastructure and access to knowledge. Very professional administration and things work smoothly. Competitive salaries.,0.00055316964,0.0006137008,0.9988331
Some professors are hard to handle and simply have too much power. Some of them solely would like to focus on research and give teaching a lower priority.,0.9986193,0.0012196776,0.00016098915
ETH is a massive structure that provides solid employee benefits with a huge community. Zurich is an expensive city but very nice to live in (with over 30% expats). ETH has good funding so equipment is cuttingedge.,0.000607333,0.0006614534,0.9987312
As a Phd student you are basically your boss' minion. ETH provides surprisingly little support to students who have issues even though some professors will repeatedly cause problems  to Phd students. Official option is: you can quit if you don't like bad treatment.  The existing union also doesn't handle shortcontract workers at the university (so no help for Phds and Postdocs).  That said I know many Phd students and scientists who love working there.,0.99851567,0.0013181386,0.00016611838
There are many great points about working for ETH Zurich the salaries are really competitive the work conditions are nice and the institution is internationally recognized. Moreover Zurich is a beautiful place to live and has one of the highest living qualities in the world.,0.000286943,0.00046695932,0.9992461
The main downside of working at ETH Zurich is that it is really difficult to get a permanent position there. Positions are rare and new openings are quite improbable meaning that it is really difficult to make a longterm career in this institution. On the other hand it is a good platform to find a permanent position in one of the other swiss universities like EPFL.,0.5166576,0.47922748,0.0041149287
I enjoy the possibility of working with other scientist that have different backgrounds. The science that is done here is toplevel. The salary is very good for the position.,0.004161718,0.1415585,0.85427976
As with all postdoc jobs there is basically no opportunity for career growth within ETH. Even though you are in principle entitle to 25 days of vacation per year depending on who your PI is actually taking the days off may prove to be a challenge. If you want to work here and be successful make sure you are in a lab that has a clear vision of what they are working on and that you understand how you fit in this big picture. If not you may end up putting a lot of effort into unfocused work i.e. working a lot with very limited results.,0.99802005,0.0018315627,0.00014835465
Stimulating environment very good facilities excellent salary for a PhD position. Zurich and Switzerland offer a very high standard of living with good health care and appealing scenery. ETH is a well organized institution with comparably low bureaucratic overhead and good benefits. Researchwise ETH is rated as world class university. Research focus is dedicatedly on Science and Engineering (similar to MIT).,0.0003560257,0.0007208527,0.9989231
Finding a flat in Zurich can be tricky. To integrate in the research groups English is perfectly fine. Outside the university some German would be a definite advantage. Even though generally ranked one of the top 5 schools ETH is less well known in the anglosaxon world than their own universities.,0.0031580403,0.9964599,0.0003819944

Great infrastructure and research conditions respectful and collaborative environment great salary compared to similar univerisities plentiful  of options to attend seminars sports and the gym apply for funding for innovative teaching projects or other ideas.,0.00040034184,0.00028050796,0.9993192
As the working conditions depend a lot on the research group and direct supervisor working conditions may vary for researchers. The campus is distributed over the city so the feeling of belonging to ETH might not come as naturally as with other universities. Not many positions for assistant or associate professors who search tenure.,0.9969998,0.002839726,0.00016045776
Great infrastructure facilities worklife balance. Basel Biosystems Science and Engineering campus is near FMI institute University of Basel Roche and Novartis but very little access to ETH Zurich's main campus. Very professional in terms of managing the building IT infrastructure microscopy facilities and providing help to researchers whenever they need it. Very good pay and time off.,0.003739013,0.0031509437,0.99311006
Doesn't feel like a university setting outside of the building located in a more industrial setting. Don't have access to all of the intellectual resources and diversity of a true University campus even though BSSE department is very strong overall in our research areas. Need more interactions with  collaborators other universities and industry. Could take better advantage of Roche and Novartis in Basel.,0.99477416,0.0050682453,0.00015763353

Not many chances for career progress once you are over 6 years of Oberassistent  you have to leave! ETH Zurich does not offer a reasonable number of permanent positions at the assistant professor level. If they spent less financial resources and funding with full professors which can be over a CHF 1 million per year (~USD 1 million) not counting external funding more opportunities would be possible for younger scientists.,0.9986149,0.001232481,0.00015258747
Lots of independence the resources at your disposal are literally second to none and the university if very well funded.,0.9988753,0.00095412973,0.00017053941
There are lots of random HR rules which professors can hide behind so as not to actually make decisions this ranges from time limits on employment contracts to decisions an salary levels. They can also find money when they need to buy new equipment but somehow have no budgetary control when it would benefit employees.,0.9988109,0.0010248428,0.00016436147
The team was very interesting there were a lot of smart people. The working environment was good (thanks to a professor who knew how to manage his group well) and it was generally enjoyable. The working hours were completely flexible i.e. you could come and go when you wanted.,0.0002362513,0.00069019536,0.9990735
The expectations are very very high. It may be that you work on a publication for a long time and it still gets rejected. Ask yourself if you really want to spend a year or two on a project that might completely fail and be good for nothing. The working hours were very long (more than 10 hours a day).,0.99885297,0.0009824625,0.00016454501
ETH is a topnotch university that takes education seriously. Courses have a level of formality that I'd never seen before and really gets one to understanding things. Besides its prestige is relevant on anybody's cv,0.9934323,0.006164189,0.00040346084
It is a demanding occupation in  very competitive environment and sometimes the pressure to publish might seem overwhelming. But still the trick is to take a deep breath and take it easy.,0.9833582,0.016358104,0.00028369328
the pay is among the best for a phd position. Not all labs/departments pay the same: first year students receive between 47'000 and 70'000 (brutto) and it increases over the first two years reaching 50'000 to 80'000 from the third year onwards.,0.008925118,0.97631454,0.0147602605
Some professors (not mine!) put extremely high pressure on students and do not treat them nicely. Before joining try to find in which category your future professor belongs! Hint: if a professor has a high share of Swiss or European students he/she is likely to treat them humanly: these students would leave and get a job somewhere else in Europe instead (which is not that easy for nonEU citizens...),0.99634105,0.0035097217,0.00014916323
Important: It completely depends from the institute! Very flexible process of employment Great way of communication. My job was focussing on a special task and I had a lot of freedom to fulfill it.,0.00027844834,0.0004828209,0.9992387
In my case I was employed to fulfill a special job. The initial contract was about two month. I needed three month to complete the job and was payed for the third month as well.

 Communication between different research groups is not encouraged and does not generally happen.  The staff is generally more interested in research than in teaching. The quality of some lectures are rather poor for such a prestigious institution.  Some of the research groups are fairly large with the result that professors become managers and rather disconnected from current research.,0.998543,0.0013031953,0.0001538044

ETH is a highly credible research institution. The facilities are some of the best in the world which allows for a very competitive research environment. I have worked at many other high level research institutions with large budgets and none come close to the resources available at ETH.,0.0006988447,0.0022742855,0.99702686
Working hours are long but this is common in academia and varies highly based on the adviser. Also the location is somewhat out of the city if 'hardcore' science is done. The biggest con is certainly the pay. The pay for a postdoc is set by the department section so it is highly variable.,0.9981823,0.0016782728,0.00013941129
There are lots of pros I will try to summarize them in the following bullets: a) Very good working environment b) Very good salary as a PhD student in comparison to other unis in other countries c) Good funding hence lots of facilities are present for research d) Very good benefits you have like certain discounts from the SBB (Swiss trains company) and internet provider as well as very large and well equipped sports centers where you can practice lots of sports for very minor price,0.0003307541,0.00076264516,0.9989066

The only downsides are that you normally can't start a PhD after you are 3035 as ETH is looking for young candidates. In addition they expect you to finish within 34 years unless you have a very very good reason not to (since they're paying you),0.99483347,0.0049901055,0.00017641787

It is unconscionable but no surprise that two key reports that focus upon improving organization and management performance have been largely ignored by the Executive Office and other managers. These are the 2017 Ombudsman’s Report and the 2017 Gavi People’s Survey. Both contained explosive findings but no serious action is being taken to remedy them. In the private sector these reports would cause heads to roll. At GAVI the opposite is happening. The Ombudsman’s Report stated “First our published values have not been immediately evident – as one colleague said “They are not really published at all. They are hard to find. The values need to be more broadly institutionalised…and modelled and supported by senior leadership.”13 Visitors (to the Ombudsman) frequently described a fear of retaliation for speaking up – a fear undimmed by the policy availability in Gavi on respectful working. They described a lack of trust in the equitable application of policies regarding accountability as well as those regarding recruitment and internal promotions. Gavi staff have perceived historical exceptions in the application of policy standards and their existence reportedly colours any motivation to use them or to appeal to managers involved. As one of many concerned colleagues noted “I don’t see the value in appealing to fairness or equity – [in Gavi] it’s who you know.” In a comment frequently reflected by Gavi colleagues and Ombudsman visitors another noted “In Gavi favouritism and retaliation are widespread”. The most commonly expressed retaliatory anxiety was to lose one’s job. The Gavi People’s Survey revealed that most staff believe that individuals are not held accountable not recognized or rewarded appropriately and do not understand how they are evaluated.  They do not have the IT systems they need to do their work effectively either internally or with partners and the majority are afraid to speak up and challenge the leadership.  Staff believe strongly in vision and mission of the organisation and that the salaries and benefits are excellent. But they do not see a professional future in the organization and do not have faith in the leadership to be honest open and manage effectively. Therefore the majority stated that it would not take much to persuade them to move on. The organisation is plagued with a very political culture and populated with many incompetent unaccountable inexperienced sycophantic and in some cases dishonest and/or abusive technical unit managers who frequently fail to carry out and in some cases forge staff performance reviews. There is a tendency to fire those who suggest improvements or could actually do their job better than them. This is accompanied by exceptionally poor human resources management that is complicit with the political culture and a culture of overwork and serious burnout.  For a multibillion dollar organisation the accounting and other IT systems are a joke as they are largely based on Excel spreadsheets. There are only rudimentary planning budgeting and accrual accounting systems and the organisation cannot accurately report expenditure against budget. There are no logical document filing systems and so institutional memory is by oral tradition.  This organisation chews up and spits out good people and is a house of cards that is just waiting to fall down………,0.99769515,0.0020385373,0.00026627688

I worked at Hult for about a year in the Luzern office as an Enrollment Coordinator.  My experience working for the Company has been great and formative.   The environment is young and multicultural where people are motivated to do their best but also learnbydoing which really helps to grow/ameliorate one's skills.  I also had the chance to engage and participate in some fieldwork and Events prior to the Covid situation. Thus I was supported in these additional activities by both my Managers which were keen to contribute to my career development.   These Events allowed me to have a broader experience of what the whole business is about which reflected on my daily tasks and ultimately on my performance.,0.00021390613,0.00082994456,0.9989561

The company culture Hult provides you with an amazing international environment. With their students they apply nationality caps in order to ensure that the experience will be truly international and it is quite the same at the office. Hult is committed to innovate and the employer feels he/ she can change things from the inside it truly happened to me a couple of times. Hult is a school that really cares about their candidates and alumni and enrollment advisors keep this relationship with them which I never saw in any other school. As an enrollment advisor myself I am glad of having had the opportunity to cultivate that practice and collaborating with their customer service. That might be what makes the working environment exceptional managers trust their employees and let them foster their skills and grow.  I learnt a lot at Hult and I only left because during those 6 years a a half I learnt their lesson of not staying in the comfort zone for too long.,0.00086277927,0.0027426577,0.9963946

" Zero respect and no idea what retaining talents can mean.  Worst ""culture"" I've ever seen in my 15 years career (endless silent burn outs or people in sick leave for months due to this) faculties being the most arrogant ones.  There's a massive sense of fear at all levels in all departments.  Sr managers and/or Csuite play games of power among them cascading all the consequences on those in charge of execution.  Read this twice: they blame you for whatever they fear to take ownership for. Meaning that nobody dares to take decisions and you pingpong here and there for weeks and months (no matter how much you have shined elsewhere).  HR are so desperate that the only conclusion they come up with is ""we understand and we agree with you you're totally right but unfortunately there's nothing we can do"" meaning you either accept this or leave. When they're not able to find a valid reason to fire you they would do all they can to make you quit.  As other people have already mentioned they're on another planet compared to what they preach.

IMD is a toxic place full of narcissist and antisocial disorder (also known as sociopath) top management. They pretend to care but consider employees as pawn that can easily be replaced.

IMD used to be a fabulous place to work with a great and open atmosphere and a well functioning totally flat organisation. It was great for the international employees and students coming to the school as well as opportunities abound to participate in different programs and to continue learning  always. Lots of benefits with good social insurances great meals and long vacation.,0.00041572415,0.0003665479,0.99921775
IMD is suffering from bad and diluted leadership. The current president is a very nice guy who however does not have the guts needed to run the place. The leadership team is outdated and not in tunes with the times: mostly old men and little if any women. IMD has built silos and slathered on administrative positions thus fattening the organisation and the real essence and team spirit has gone missing. Each silo is very defensive/agressive and not collaborative at all. IMD has two groups of employees: Faculty and staff. If you encounter a problem internally do not count on HR to support you.,0.99798965,0.0017511195,0.00025922095

I am a current manager here and this is the only place where it seems to be safe to talk safely.  Slackers who play suck up game to management get promoted and stay there for years.. Complete incompetence is accepted as long as you play the political game and cosy up to the right people... Don't you dare criticizing management you will be mobbed out. Some managers are so unfit for their positions its actually shocking they're kept in their positions for so long in a management development school nonetheless. No management skills whatsoever no coaching performance reviews are a joke HR are actually a joke.. Upper management are gutless most faculty notably some French ones are arrogant and like to prey on support staff to feel empowered and no one has the courage to state the obvious and control these behaviors. Even  some assistants (PCFA) now have a god complex and forgot humility and teamwork.. Cleaning crew are probably the last beacon of humility and hard work in this place. IMD is no longer what it used to be talent isn't retained nor does it even want to be anymore recruitment quality at all levels is horrible culture inexistant.. Sexism mobbing bullying favoritism are a norm.  And the current president despite being an angry diva is at least better than the previous who was as useful as a lamppost during daytime. Customers aren't buying the hypocrisy anymore it's palpable in the air.,0.9983967,0.0014412279,0.00016206273

The structure of work leaves something to be desired with multiple problems arising from my short time there. There seems to be little communication between departments which leads to misunderstandings and the use of three computer systems doesn't help anyone. From personal experience management did not know what they wanted for a candidate for the position offered to me with the work given to me done efficiently and effectively they decided they no longer had need for the position. This may be down to the particular manager i had though it felt extremely unjust and poorly handled.,0.9989536,0.00090835255,0.00013796355

Management team is run by academics and is very political and not very dynamic. The feel of a twoclass society amongst staff with professors on one side and staff on the other.

Top management is deaf to anyone that is not faculty. Divide between staff and management is getting bigger no effort is made to create one organisation that pulls together. Salaries/bonuses are extremely high for faculty while the rest of the organisation is starved. Many silos every professor does his/her own thing no community feeling. Sole focus is on sales no long term vision for developing the brand employees or capabilities. R&D is run like a corporate unit with no academic spirit but still the management wants to highlight the academic credentials. Negative results in recent rankings increasingly critical comments from clients show that this is also seen from external.,0.9988851,0.0009777971,0.00013708392
TERRIFIC people;  wellorganized with coherent goals; incredible atmosphere  yes including the lunch.

"The IB is a great place to work. The atmosphere is wonderful as coworkers are very friendly and motivated. This is made possible by the relationship between the Board management and staff  working towards a common goal. The whole organisation is structured around the IB Mission of aiming ""to create a better world through education"". And considering the responsibility that the organisation has towards its stakeholders the organisation allows for innovation and its proactive in terms of ""what to deliver""; ""who to deliver to"" and ""how to deliver"". This calls for careful planning with the input from all. What I personally like about the IB is its mission and especially its commitment to Social Responsibility with the aim of improving the quality of life of the IB staff all stakeholders and society at large: what better way to improve the wellbeing of mankind than through education  encouraging ""students across the world to become active compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people with their differences can also be right.""",0.00026931867,0.000692766,0.999038

I have worked at UZH as a postdoctoral researcher for about 3 years. There was always enough money to carry out the research I intended to do and to attend major conferences (this is not always the case in an academic setting). I extremely enjoyed the young international and dynamic teams with flat hierarchies. You always find scientifically brilliant colleagues and supervisors to discuss your ideas future projects and problems with. UZH also offers great opportunities to evolve through networking events advanced trainings and career workshops. In addition I personally enjoyed the reduced ASVZ membership a sports union offering numerous daily classes all over the city.,0.0005469108,0.0008778243,0.9985752
Unfortunately as so often in academic research there is no possibility for a longterm employment. A stable work situation can only be found as research assistant or professor (see also Advice to Management). In addition in my previous institute the IT department was slow and avoided to help individuals. Hopefully this is not an overall UZH issue.,0.9987154,0.001168052,0.000116578274

"Professors and senior researchers are so much cautions about publishing things that may be too risky or that might created a big (negative/positive) impact to the community which is not so ""diplomatic"". Therefore I would classify the professors and senior researchers as very very conservative in this way. They want to preserve their images (as anyone would do that's fine) but they don't try to push too hard to create a big impact for something that might generate deeper discussion. They just don't want too much exposure in my humble opinion.",0.052677635,0.9468718,0.00045060465
Excellent salary for a PhD position (relative to the rest of the world). Generally excellent support from the University in all matters (e.g. immigration issues). Good food at the Mensas.

As usual with PhD positions must pay conference fees travel and accommodation outofpocket and apply for reimbursement. Even on a Swiss salary this can make some months financially tight while you're waiting for reimbursement. Chances to stay in academia in Switzerland after the PhD are hard to come by as there are not many higher positions available in nationally. Hard to find good housing in Zurich especially on a student salary.,0.99903166,0.00080318586,0.0001651965

As a socialscientist the University is not very open to internationalstudents. There is a resistance to holding academic discussions or administrative meetings in English rather than German.  Career prospects are poor: the academic structure where the professor rules a small (or sometimes quite large) fiefdom of PhD students and one or two postdocs is extremely limiting from a careerperspective while academically (depending on the professor) the  hierarchical structure can stifle any form of critical discussion.  The hiring policy seems pretty random and in particular does not serve the teaching needs of the student body by creating a diverse (and also inspiring) range of subjects but rather the whimsical academic interests of the professor.,0.99811566,0.001678962,0.00020540127

Very small salaries. Compared to other reviewers mine was well below 50% which made life in Zürich a nightmare  altough this strictly depends on the chair. I suggest potential employees to look at the ETH for jobs and PhDs rather than at the University of Zürich. ETH is better organized has more funding and staff is employed with fairer conditions. Mensa is horrible and very small at the University although the saff is very friendly and helpful.,0.9803786,0.019214496,0.00040683255

The atmosphere is one of the most positive of any university I have been to. The emphasis on work and life is very well balanced and people are genuinely happy to be part of this organization.

Zurich is a beautiful place to live and the University is exceptionally well funded in comparison to North American and other European universities.

"A huge 'con' is that in many areas the place is absolutely rife with bullying. Some of the lowprofile departments (IT museum services etc.) are OK and there are good people there.   But there's no real protection for staff  no union no HR process  it's just down to a manager's whim ""Here's two months pay now get your bags.""  And sadly this happens all the time. HR are downright nasty and certain departments (Communications Sponsorship and Marketing) are minefields.   Things were bad under Rogue and have gotten worse under Bach. A lot of staff frankly aren't very bright and there's a nasty 'waspish' atmosphere to the whole culture.   Also  obviously  there's little to no career 'progression' because the organisation is to small and 'flat' for it to happen. You might get your bosses job if they retire or die.   It pays to ask very very pointed and searching questions at the interview stage.   Too many people are awestruck by the rings. Before accepting a role look on LinkedIn for some exstaff and ask for a chat.   Whatever you do don't even think about relocating until you've survived a coupe of years and at least one Games (winter summer or youth).   Finally you do need to be able to speak French. In theory you could get away in some departments without it (Sports) but without bulletproof support from the President you'd be sidelined and very quickly mobbedout.",0.9962018,0.003538136,0.00026011514

It is not a meritocracy. It lacks vision focus and its impact is very suspect indeed. It has a strange internal politics which excludes people who are not from a couple of western European countries. It is in need of proper management and some checks and balances especially within middle management. There is a huge number of people with unstable contracts while there are people who do nothing but could never be fired because of their contractual status. Often middle managers abuse and bully those with unstable contracts because they have little practical recourse to justice or other avenues for protection.

Distressing culture of employee abuse fostered by overpaid and entitled top management who believe they are above the organisation's rules and make decisions without proper consideration for the consequences to the detriment of the employees and organization as a whole. Promotions and advancements are not based on merit or performance but rather on personal connections and favoritism which have left many talented employees disheartened undervalued and burnedout. A culture of fear and silence as instances of misconduct including harassment and discrimination are disregarded or swept under the rug by the management. Should you still decide to join be ready for the constant restructuring (every twothree years) as rather than fostering an environment of stability and growth the management seems to relish in implementing unnecessary changes that disrupt workflows and leave employees feeling insecure about their roles and future. The impossibility of naturalizing in Switzerland and the absence of legal accountability (employees enjoy no protection and can seek no redress under Swiss national laws) further exacerbates the already dire situation.,0.9989742,0.00086847437,0.00015735535

"Top management does not care about the ""regular"" employees. There is a clear separation of the top (a handful of executive members) and the rest. Retaliation by the top management is not considered retaliation (at least in practice....). If you close your eyes you won't see the retaliation. Harassment by the top management is not considered harassment (at least in practice....). Again if you close your eyes you won't see the harassment. No working internal system of justice in place which helps the top management remain unpunished. Internal justice system is in the hands of the same top management. Once again please just close your eyes... Abuse by this management is just a regular thing as many employees have to tolerate such abuse having little or no choice (e.g. for some employees leaving the Global Fund i.e. leaving their life in Switzerland means returning to their politically unstable or extremely poor countries).

Leadership and the organization are constantly changing yet there are no mechanisms in place to support or help staff adapt to ongoing change leading to high levels of stress challenging work environment and poor worklife balance. Managers are weak and senior management does not lead. Certain departments are of course better than others but departments once praised are now struggling to deliver. There are well known political battles and personality conflicts at the senior management level that get in the way of getting real work done. The organization does not address poor performers and therefore managers are forced to do the work of their senior managers work and push their work to individual contributors. Due to the small size of the organization there is limited growth potential. Individuals coming from the private sector may find it difficult to succeed here.

"Poor work/life balance  everything had to be done 5 minutes ago since our core business is ""saving lives"".  Frequent turnover of senior management leads to inconsistent workplace culture.  Being ""humanitarians"" for those in developing countries seems to replace the need for basic respect and integrity in human resource decision making at the headquarter level.

Very political internally and increasingly process heavy. Unless you work in external relations (dealing with donors/ fundraising) or in managing country portfolios (i.e. if you work in a support function/ in a technical field that facilitates the work of grant management) you are likely to get stuck in politics.  It is really sad that an organization that started as a simple and solution oriented organization has now grown to become bureaucratic.  It is also very discouraging that smart and experienced people are leaving by the dozens because there is no talent retention / management. There are 3 different HR processes (performance management talent management professional development opportunities) that try to address talent management but none of the processes are managed sensibly. The processes don't speak to one another and HR procedures are implemented inconsistently across the organization...,0.9981395,0.0016673187,0.00019316893

Continuous change of structure/business model and total confusion of everyone about everything business processes are unclear and too flexible albeit excessively bureaucratic; management has very little of responsibility and avoid taking important/critical/strong decisions; loads of political games and favoritism when it comes to appointment to senior positions; senior management keeps a long distance from regular staff; poor compensation package comparing to the market; last but not least a very topheavy organization with lots of managers insufficient number of employees/workers and thus extremely poor worklife balance.

 Total lack of connection with what the realities are in LMICs. Those who don't travel to the countries have no idea what's going on in country and what impact their work has. Little feedback of information to the secretariat.    Absence of planning standardization organization and operational procedures. Responsibilities within the organization are assigned on an informal basis leaving new hires wondering where to go to figure out who does what. Some efforts are under way to correct this.    Pathetic treatment of consultants is obvious irresponsible and harms the organization's reputation. If GF is to be a modern employer they need to figure out how to ensure those working for them are treated fairly and equitably. Consultants have no health insurance no paid holiday no internal mobility no transportation benefits and are treated as disposable. This is embarrassing.

Worklife balance is an almost nonexistent concept with very heavy work load high stress lots of pressure and impossible deadlines and objectives. Many colleagues are burnt out. Since recently there is very little possibility for promotions and growth (the promotion policy has been in discussion for years but still has not been adopted by HR). High level of bureaucracy which makes you lose focus and steer away from the main goals of the organization. The roles of individual positions are often unclear leading to frustrations and tense relations between employees and their managers. The system of performance reviews is far too complex and still does not allow to adequately track performance of individual staff and compare it to that of other colleagues. There is also often a perception of a disconnect between the senior management and operational staff with many decisions taken on top being impossible (or extremely difficult) to implement by staff working directly with countries leading to additional frustrations and tensions.,0.999086,0.00076527917,0.00014880035

Horrible management in HQ: too many political games poor communication no vision and no guts. It can be very difficult for commited staff trying to do their best working passionately as they are frequently not listened to nor trusted.

Very frustrating experience when you know that the ultimate mission is to support people in need and instead of that you just see powerful managers prioritizing their careers. Poor HR support & advice (they are in Budapest far from your concerns). Career opportunities are limited without intense networking and competition is high for every position.

Amazingly nice and smart colleagues one of the best team that I have ever worked for where my colleagues became good friends. I had a genius humble hardworking and problem solver supervisor in SMT who have our backs and with whom we can have honest conversations (he can give lessons in leadership). I resigned from Unitaid as I want to work in the field  Under the management  Unitaid has been put on the map in global health. Previously Unitaid was only known as a procurement agency. Now Unitaid has a place at the table on high level panels such as AMR where it's leading the committee on innovation. Unitaid is invited to major global health events where it can influence public health policymaking.     The SMT has worked hard to put procedures in place that was previously nonexistent.  The strategy is cutting edge with one of the most resultsbased programming I have seen practiced qui peut froisser la suceptibilite de certains  grantees as Unitaid continuously challenge them for results. RESULTS should continue to remain at the forefront of the strategy and implementation.   The diversity of the projects we get to work on which makes the work super interesting,0.001477705,0.0046817805,0.99384046

Unitaid needs fresh management approaches and new experienced managers. The new ED tries to bring positive changes to the organizational culture but there is a visible resistance to change by many other members of the senior and middle management team the legacy of the previous ED who had brought and promoted his buddies for most of the senior level jobs. Opaque recruitment and promotion practices still continue career opportunities continue to be available only for a closed circle of people. It is difficult to believe that cultural change will be possible without further changes in the upper échelons.,0.9964689,0.0033622454,0.00016882682

This is not the most diverse organization. Hard to grow or even get a job for people from developing countries most staff is caucasian.

Limited Englishtaught programs: While the university offers several programs taught in English the majority of courses are taught in German. This may pose a challenge for nonGermanspeaking students who wish to study at the university. High living costs: Switzerland is known for its high cost of living and Bern is no exception. Students may find it challenging to afford accommodation food and other living expenses while studying at the university. Limited campus housing: The university has limited oncampus housing options which means that most students have to find accommodation offcampus.

This means that admission to some programs can be highly competitive and prospective students may need to have outstanding academic records to be considered for admission.,0.99871576,0.0011431668,0.00014109259

 Big talk negative impact: All focus on events; not moving the industry forward. Frequently appropriates language from climate justice movements but it's mostly greenwashing. In service of large businesses looking to stay relevant not driving actual change. Few smaller or midsized innovative companies join or engage.  New strategy every 5 months: Focus is on creating new projects and new workstreams not carrying existing ones to fruition that will hopefully attract new members  Siloed work environment: Your only contact to the organization is your boss  at least until you make to Sr. Director.  Serious lack of diversity: WBCSD has far too few women or POC at leadership levels for an organization with a global mandate.

I agree with other reviews. I faced a lot of harassment myself and I've witnessed harassment towards two other employees. That happened fore 2019 but there was no option to select that year in the review. Two of us left at the same time for the same reason. We both reported to HR what has been happening for months nearly an year. I also had facts screenshots and proof. Nothing happened to the perpetrators (who ironically were both women). That made it clear we did the right choice by leaving. Of course those people stayed for years after. This was the worst work experience I have ever had which eventually also led to burnout due to mobbing during my last month there and affected me for years after.

WHO is a very bureaucratic hierarchical political antiquated and riskaverse organization. There is poor job security and very limited options for career development especially for junior employees. Its processes are very inefficient and transversal departments (e.g. human resources administration communications) provide poor support to technical employees. Advancing new ideas and innovating is extremely difficult. The recruitment process can easily take up to 9 months for regular technical staff (or more for the highestlevel positions) and recruitment processes are so slow that is very difficult (or impossible) to hire people to cover for employees on sick or parental leave.

This bird's eye view of the international public health community is unbeatable. If you are a researcher there are data and access to information that give staff the opportunity to do great things. While WHO has lost most of its funding to big conglomerate propjects such as GAVI and the Global Fund the willingness of the staff to continue the efforts is unfailing. There is intense talent dedication and a large cadre of unsung heroes within the walls of this agency.,0.7025374,0.24107286,0.05638969
As amazing as the technical talent is equally astonishing is the lack of understanding of basic business management principles. Intense conduct problems nepotism and failures to have modern HR and financial management run unchecked and consume enormous amounts of time and energy.   The budget situation is so severe that chairs and desks have not been replaced since the 80's. While we fly people to Geneva for expensive expert meetings staff are even left to bring their own office supplies computer cables and the like.

As an intern one does not have the status required to parttake actively in discussions with stakeholders. Moreover little training is given and tasks related to internship are unclear until you actually take up the job. Then it all depends on what you make out of it and the work connection with your adviser. On the other hand there's very little chance to land a job or consultancy after the end of the internship (as WHO has a 3 months rule before you are illegible to apply) which doesn't make it worthwhile. I would advise anyone looking for an internship in Geneva to look into: ILO IOM IFRC and ICRC (paid internships).,0.99882823,0.0010306562,0.00014111873
Your experience at WHO HQ will be very contingent on the office culture in your department but as an intern you will definitely gain a lot of exposure to the daytoday operations of a largescale international organization interact with a very diverse staff and gain access to an incredible array of contacts (ranging from doctors to economists and former policymakers). Generally the staff in any given department/unit tends to be passionate about and dedicated to the field global health and social justice. Your teamwork crosscultural communication and technical competency is likely to increase appreciably.,0.0006103641,0.027332181,0.97205746
As an intern you might receive some guidance from your supervisor but this is highly variable and may not be possible at times (esp. if your supervisor is on duty travel frequently). Also unlike many private sector firms WHO internships are unpaid and do not in any way map onto increased employment opportunities at WHO HQ or its Regional Offices.,0.99894434,0.00090343325,0.00015215398
"The WHO houses some of the best public health technical expertise in the world. The opportunities to learn from colleagues' professional experiences and technical knowhow are plentiful.

"Too much emphasis on technical research capacity and enough bureaucratic red tape to suffocate oneself. The actual ""doing"" in the field gets done by contracted private companies or NGOs; the HQ in Geneva is more placed to provide technical expertise and serve as a hub for political engagement. I was often frustrated with the laissezfaire attitude of some staff who were clearly only there for the UN ""perks"" and were far less concerned with having an impact in developing countries. The approval process for projects was long and grueling. In the end I chose to leave WHO because it was far too removed from the real tangible experience that comes from working in the field.",0.99858093,0.0012615969,0.00015747815

WWF seems to be more about marketing than science. It is understandable that advocacy is part in parcel with protecting nature but when it's conducted by marketing and communications people instead of scientists and environmentalists then the policy lacks integrity. I also am surprised how many people on staff don't actually engage in outdoor activities and adventures or practice what they preach about reduced consumption of meat their choice of transportation waste and recycling.  Surprised to see so much leadership void of an environmental background. There are several events that leadership teams attend they just happen to be dinners and blacktie events not conservation events.

Restructuring is never painless or perfect but the International change management team did not do the process efficiently or humanly. A lot of staff were made redundant and then asked to stay for years after being given a letter.

This applies only to my research group within the School of Management and Law. Since it is a university culture varies greatly between the research groups and faculties.  Very flexible when it comes to working parttime e.g. during a masters degree. I was able to sometimes not have to show up for 23 weeks and compensate later if necessary.

This does only apply to the School of Management and Law. Upper management is way too controlling.

"Worked for the Department ""School of Management and Law"".  You can't really make a career without a doctor degree. It's a one way path since you don't really gain real working experience. Except you move from Uni to a data analysis job but when going to applied marketing for example you have no experience. An other con is that there was no money for nothing. We had to look for money all the time. That means you end up writing applications instead of doing something cool!",0.9975923,0.0021587475,0.00024887378
After completion of the bachelor’s degree I continued my career journey as a Mechanical Engineering intern at Centre for Product and Process Development (ZPP) ZHAW University Winterthur Switzerland (February 2018 – Up to now).
