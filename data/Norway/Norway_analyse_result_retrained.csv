Very stressful. Management's idea of encouragement is a stern office morale of 'no limits! no excuses!' and to not discuss or even acknowledge human error. Not very uplifting. Many get disheartened when they don't meet team goals. Have overheard backtalk and mild sexism coming from higher ups. Tiring work 5 hours on your feet walking no real option for bathroom breaks. There can be uncomfortable or confrontational situations  you often walk alone which I think is a bad call. Door 2 Door crew should operate in groups of at least two. Lunch breaks are had in stairwells and parking lots. Occasional obligatory meetings take up time you're not paid for.,0.9988456,0.00097324315,0.00018111817

Nothing positive about this university as an employee,0.99873334,0.0011362502,0.00013034114
I feel compelled to share my harrowing experience as an employee at NTNU in order to caution potential job seekers about the terrible treatment and discrimination I endured. This university demonstrated a shocking lack of expertise and understanding of basic rules fostering a toxic work environment where employees constantly competed against one another. From the moment I joined NTNU it became painfully evident that the administration had little regard for its employees. Discrimination was rampant with certain individuals receiving preferential treatment while others were subjected to unjust treatment and bias. The university's leadership seemed entirely ignorant of employment regulations exacerbating the distressing situation. The work atmosphere at NTNU was suffocating and disheartening. Instead of encouraging collaboration and support the university thrived on creating an environment filled with animosity and mistrust. Every employee was on guard fearful that their colleagues would undermine them at every opportunity. This toxic culture impeded productivity and made it impossible to focus on our duties. Effective communication was virtually nonexistent within the university. Important information was often withheld or poorly communicated leading to widespread confusion and chaos. Requests for clarification or assistance were met with indifference or even hostility leaving employees feeling isolated and frustrated.,0.9990388,0.0008085961,0.00015252695

 Very bad media for the international researchers.  Lack of respect for the talented people  They consider talented forigeners as temporary researcher and then do not let them to and support them for growing up their ideas.  they have a limit of 3 years of work in teh institues!  a lot of competetion between the professors since the labs are shared.  lots of people try to pull the rug under foot of eachother.  has a bad raputation for mistreating a foriegn professor in 2020 and firing him.,0.99833727,0.0014988994,0.00016381577

"Apparently since very recently (may be a year ago or more) they have got a descrimination policy against people from countries such as Iran China Russia North korea etc (Disclaim: do your own research of course they will say it is NOT true but there were articles studying that as well as just go there and ask yourself). If that is true then there is no hope for the future of this ""university""! Disclaim again: do your own research I take no liability because all universities who do this do not say it publicly hence there is no easy way to prove it but you can look at statistics or follow journlists who look into that. It HURTS more when they claim they treat applicants equally but they have a policy against some nationals! anyway just do your own research on this topic.
