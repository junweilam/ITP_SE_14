From the moment I joined NTNU, it became painfully evident that the administration had little regard for its employees. Discrimination was rampant, with certain individuals receiving preferential treatment while others were subjected to unjust treatment and bias. The university's leadership seemed entirely ignorant of employment regulations, exacerbating the distressing situation. The work atmosphere at NTNU was suffocating and disheartening. Instead of encouraging collaboration and support, the university thrived on creating an environment filled with animosity and mistrust. Every employee was on guard, fearful that their colleagues would undermine them at every opportunity. This toxic culture impeded productivity and made it impossible to focus on our duties. Effective communication was virtually non-existent within the university. Important information was often withheld or poorly communicated, leading to widespread confusion and chaos. Requests for clarification or assistance were met with indifference or even hostility, leaving employees feeling isolated and frustrated."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "NTNU as university and its working environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "30 Jun 2023", "job_title": "PhD Candidate in \u00c5lesund", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "As Norway's largest university, NTNU offers a good working environment for both local and international.
