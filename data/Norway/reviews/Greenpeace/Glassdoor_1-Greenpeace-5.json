Management's idea of encouragement is a stern office morale of 'no limits! no excuses!' and to not discuss or even acknowledge human error. Not very uplifting. Many get disheartened when they don't meet team goals. Have overheard backtalk and mild sexism coming from higher ups. Tiring work, 5+ hours on your feet walking, no real option for bathroom breaks. There can be uncomfortable or confrontational situations - you often walk alone, which I think is a bad call. Door 2 Door crew should operate in groups of at least two. Lunch breaks are had in stairwells and parking lots. Occasional obligatory meetings take up time you're not paid for."}], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
