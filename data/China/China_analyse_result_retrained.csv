The HR department here has always been quick to respond to problems and most will find ways to solve problems.  Since they have hired American deans dedicated to specific areas (Humanities Math & Sciences) teacher support has improved. The Chinese management team at my school is very responsive to teachers needs and will offer all the assistance possible within their abilities to provide.  The Chinese teachers are all extremely professional and coordinate well with the foreign teachers.,0.009223625,0.10287219,0.88790417
The schools tends to hold on onto marginal students who have difficulty in grasping the curriculum or those students who are just lazy refusing to do any homework and having terrible test scores (but somehow still manage to get into top universities).  Schools tend to focus to much on TOEFL prep for Senior 1 & 2 reducing available class time for classes such as American Studies History Literature and the sciences.  For Senior 3 the first two months is completely dedicated to SAT prep thus delaying AP classes beginning around the time of midterms The Chinese staff and parents tend to look at the US News and Business report ratings of colleges as the official rating of American universities.,0.99833655,0.0015156807,0.00014774577

School leaders are reluctant to give ambassadors full autonomy (as most Westerners are accustomed to having) and may ask or require ambassadors to report on all movements around and outside of China.

Ameson is a great option if you are looking for a job teaching in China as a foreigner. Also Ameson's different programs offer many career development opportunities.

Ameson is a Chinese company and operates with a Chinese culture. A lot of problems Westerners have with Ameson stem from this one simple fact. It can be very hard to adjust to the Chinese style of work communication and overall company culture and some people really won't succeed in this kind of environment. It's not just about crosscultural awareness but also exercising tact and serious adjustment.,0.997663,0.0022104196,0.00012654772
The Ameson Foundation: Year in China Program has changed my life. I have had an opportunity to travel to Beijing Guangzhou Changsha Foshan and an occasional trip to Hong Kong.

Some host schools have good support for foreigners who can't speak Mandarin.  I was lucky enough to be at once such location but many other schools don't have adequate support.  If you see in the recruitment flyer that they will give free Mandarin classes and give your kid free school they are wrong.  It's never included in the contract it's just a gimmick.  Reimbursements for travel or professional development are highly inefficient and complex.,0.9933931,0.0062553324,0.00035142578
It seems they are trying to add some ethnic and cultural diversity to the population of recent grads coming to China from the States. This is a really good because not only does China needs to be exposed to more diversity but there is also a current lack of opportunities in the U.S. for minorities to travel and work abroad.  helped get me through the Visa application and TEFL accreditation process paid for TEFL course and certificate found me a job in a good city that suited my interests  very open to feedback will probably see a lot of improvement in their second year there are a few individuals in the organization who worked their butts off to try to make life better for the Ameson teachers they offer cool prize and cash incentives to help them advertise they help you find jobs after you finish your first year contract! weekly newsletter is nice you get to see what the other Ameson teachers are up to and you get some helpful tips about living and working in China.,0.0034636266,0.01470793,0.98182845
grateful for the training I did receive (online and 1 week in Shanghai) but it should have been longer and needed less time spent on how to teach out of a textbook because most of us didn't receive any textbooks to use in our classes. they advertised that they would be in partnership with our schools to provide some opportunities for us to learn and experience Chinese culture (including some outings as well as Chinese language lessons) but I don't know anyone who actually got these..  Poor communication the summer before the school year started resulted in a LOT of stress wondering whether or not I would actually be going to China; as well as a lot of wasted money due to flight rescheduling  Overall they really didn't have their stuff together before they threw themselves (and ~400 recent grads) headfirst into the program and a lot of us got burned for it.,0.9986362,0.0012146529,0.00014911684
Some schools had problems but some are great.  I worked one year in Kunshan then five years in Suzhou.  Suzhou is one of the best schools in the system. It was so well run we hardly if ever saw anybody from home office on our campus. Unlike many schools where the foreign and Chinese teachers don't communicate in Suzhou there is constant interaction between the two and we constantly shared information and in many cases interacted socially outside of the job. The Principal and Vice Principal are both friendly and approachable. they never ask anything from the foreign teachers that would not be willing to do themselves.  They also trust their foreign teachers enough to give them full academic freedom to design and teach their courses with little if any oversight. Unlike many Chinese schools where students have to return to school  every evening for study hall till 9 pm our students go home.  I enjoyed my time in Suzhou and if it weren't for my daughter reaching school age I would have stayed another few years there.,0.00842589,0.1317001,0.85987407
Some students selected for the program were lazy refused to do any work and were somehow able to still get into top universities.    The counselors with Ameson need to listen to the foreign (especially the American) teachers when they suggest that students might be better served to spend their first one or two years in a community college before going on to a four year university.,0.9935782,0.006243081,0.00017867955

"Instead of dealing with a problem Ameson thought it was better to just ignore phone calls emails and concerns from applicants. Once you arrive at your host school they pretty much just dump you off and are of absolutely no help to you from there on after...that is if you ever hear from them ever again (opposite of what they tell you); everything is either ""out of their control/ there is nothing they can do about it."" The website promised weekend and holiday excursions put together by Ameson for all participants...which is also false. The orientation in Shanghai was a complete waste of time and I am glad I did not have to pay for it. They tell you that you will get your TEFL Certificate; I have yet to ever see mine. Ameson will try to market themselves by saying 5000 RBM for 23 hours of lessons per week is really good for a first time teacher in China. This is completely false. Talking with other teachers at other schools in the area...starting salaries are at least 18000 RMB for teaching an average of 10 hours of lessons a week. This is how they get host schools on board because the school can then get away with having foreign teachers work WAY too many hours for very little pay. Overall they are a very dishonest unorganized and unprofessional company and I am very embarrassed to say that I fell for their scams and lies. For my personal experience Ameson made sure to hide the fact that this was the inaugural year of the program. If I knew that I would have probably never accepted the position. In the beginning this seems like a great opportunity that does not cost too much money. Unfortunately by the time you deal with Ameson rebooking flights because of their terribly communication and having to pay for numerous ""surprises"" along the way that were ""unforeseen"" by the Chinese government...you lose a lot of money patience and sleep from this program. This company is very shady and I hope this review encourages you to look elsewhere for ESL opportunities.",0.99709904,0.002509256,0.00039177938

I wouldn't expect a company such as BC to offer a position with a salary so low.

There is a big disconnect between on the field personnel and what it takes to be a successful expat and what the people in Fort Collins actually hire. When they send someone to a country the Fort Collins office is not dealing with the ramifications of those decisions. As such they often make mistakes which can make the average employees life difficult.   There were countless mistakes to support profiles that each teacher has. In my there were around 5000 dollars of mistakes  misappropriations money added when it shouldn't have been or taken out assigned to the wrong teacher. One time 13 of us were in a meeting talking about profile expenses and every single person had had a mistake. One teacher who had been with ELIC for almost 20 years said he couldn't remember a year when there wasn't a mistake to his profile.   A few years ago they stopped recruiting teachers. Since this is an educational institution I found this odd. Also they continued to recruit families when the salary paid by most universities is not enough to support western families. Most families then had to raise extra support.,0.99838436,0.0014834366,0.00013219229
Great work experience incredible crosscultural opportunities great opportunity to live and work in community and learn how to make that work with people who are different from you Invaluable lessons in learning from others.

There's a big emphasis on employee retention (and many do stay after their first year commitment) which can feel like pressure.

ELIC is very professional in all they do. Their mission is clear. Their training is topnotch. Their fundraising support is strong and their heart is full. I taught with ELIC for 4 years. They have a great support backbone which is quite important working in a foreign country. Some teachers were independent and encountered all sorts of troubles.

What are your main goals of creating an office environment? Some offices try to promote fun and creativity while others focus on efficiency and productivity. Creating an office environment to complement these values will play a major role in fostering culture. For example an office that strives to promote creativity may want to place paintings statues or whiteboards around the office.  For an office that places value in collaboration having open work spaces may have more of a positive effect than cubicles. In other words creating a balance between values and environment can play a major role in your quest to create a culture.,0.0014895026,0.99679476,0.0017157696
Leadership challenges vary by organization but many of the most common have to do with motivating encouraging and effectively managing people. This is particularly true in business settings where employees must learn to work together in order for a company to be profitable. Any situation in which there are both leaders and supporters can have leadership challenges however including a number of volunteer organizations and community movements. Socalled “good” leadership is often a lot easier to describe than to actually implement. Many of the most common leadership challenges arise when leaders are either unaware of common pitfalls or are inattentive to developing problems,0.7250427,0.27359676,0.0013605497

"Extremely technically competent management.   Staff are all good to excellent at their jobs though some were kind of checked out sometimes.  Very easy students to deal with. Few who don't try.  ""Mastery Learning"" means anyone who tries can pass. Everyone gets as many tries as they like to get it. You don't miss your chance and then fail. This does mean adjusting your teaching style a bit and your assessment style a lot however.   Booze at company events if you consider that a pro   Lots of Professional Development opportunities.  Excellent standards in place; ones which act as guidelines and not shackles. The QSI curriculum system really is good. If you aren't already at the top of your field you will definitely improve as a teacher here.  Comprehensible and useful Moodle setup.

"Lowkey antimask attitudes abounded. People were really comfortable to admit how much they resented antiCOVID measures. Wistfully reminiscing about partying in HK.   Re: booze. A lot of teachers seemed really enthusiastic about their drinking. Like I know teachers drink. But I've never known teachers to have an ""aw yeah time to get my drink on"" attitude. It wasn't universal there but there were a few where I was like ""hmmm..."" These were the functional drunks. These were the ones who kept it together.  You see there had I was told by someone who was quitting in disgust been a bunch of them who hadn't kept it together. During the start of COVID quarantine in march 2020 classes were online. A bunch of teachers decided they'd go out drinking instead of teaching their online classes. Not go out drinking and teach hung over; drink instead of teaching. This included the principal which is why they had a new principal when I was there. Combine this with the fact that they didn't lower tuition during this period meaning parents were already annoyed and you had parents who were flaming pissed. And that's why the school was down 1/3 of its students (they recovered I estimate about 1/4 of what they lost in new students). It's also why they were facing down 100 separate lawsuits. So yeah the school was having money troubles.   And they'd hired a bunch of new teachers to replace the teachers they'd fired and the ones who had fled China during COVID. (Yeah that didn't turn out to be the good idea they had thought it was.) Way too many teachers. All of my classes were below capacity.  So they let a bunch of teachers go. One guy they told him they weren't renewing his contract then at the last minute they offered him a contract. He signed it the principal countersigned it and then later said ""hey could I get that back I need to put the company stamp on it."" He then ripped up the contract. Dude didn't have a copy of it didn't have any other proof.   This is the single most disgusting act I've ever heard of from any employer I've ever worked for and I've had a few real winners in the past. This definitely beats out the lies that man personally told me (about salary; nothing not in writing is promised! And at QSI even then it may not be!)   They had to close a campus too. The cover story was that their landlord wasn't going to let them keep using the site; but uh yeah that's probably because you're not able to keep paying them.   My boss may have lied to me at least once. Her boss definitely lied to me at least once.   Oh as you might imagine budgets were nearly nonexistent. I don't imagine that's a perennial thing at a school like QSI but there ya go.  I should also point out that there were two classes of teacher. The ones hired overseas via the international school job fair system were mostly paid roughly the same but with better benefits and job security. The local hires in China were treated as disposable. This makes a little sense to me in that the overseas hires were shuffled around the QSI network and many of the local hires wouldn't be willing. But it's still kinda awful. Now there's a third class of teacher. The ones hired to replace the ones they let go. They're hiring inexperienced teachers (not necessarily a bad thing but yeah) for lower pay. One of the new hires replaced at least two possibly three of us.   Having dependent children who need schooling there clearly also puts a target on one's back. The cost of that slot isn't the full retail value of it but obviously a teacher with no kids is cheaper for them.   Basically don't go there expecting job security any time soon. They let their insane management dig a hole for them they'll be digging themselves out of for years. (To their credit those cretins were fired.) On the plus side Shenzhen is full of schools if QSI dumps you.   Another thing which I consider a con but you may not: nearly all of the Anglophones in the staff were firmly and completely lodged in the Foreigner Bubble. I've lived in several countries and I've always tried to live as close to how locals live as I can given my circumstances. These people do not. If you're looking for that Expat Package life I guess you can have it here if you don't want to save any money. But living life as a tourist isn't for me.  Oh yeah and Shenzhen kind of sucks.

Arrogant management who speak at you and NEVER listen. In faculty  meetings Deans regularly SPEAK AT STAFF for upto EIGHT HOURS. If you comment then unless it is totally sycophantic then you are 'shouted down'. Pressure is on to NEVER fail students. Most Assessment Strategies ensure very difficult for students to fail. Student feedback is called Teaching Evaluation (TE)  and is taken as THE only SUMMATIVE measure of teaching quality. If management don't like you they will somehow 'fiddle' the TE so that you magically get 3 (out of 5) in EVERY SUBJECT for the first time in your life! If a Dean decides not to renew a faculty  contract then there is no appeal nor is there any interim feedback to indicate this likelihood.

The Chinese joint venture partner  Wanli  is awful. They are in charge of administration and infrastructure. Buildings are badly maintained and too cold in winter but too hot in summer. Many on the admin staff are rude and/or incompetent. Oncampus shops combine low quality with high prices and the owners all seem to be related to one another.  Some top people on the British side of things (research and teaching) seem a bit biased in favor of UK and Chinese personnel. at the expense of people from other countries (the majority) The location is also a problem. Ningbo is basically a dump with fewer cultural and other attractions than any British or European town with a 10th of the population.
