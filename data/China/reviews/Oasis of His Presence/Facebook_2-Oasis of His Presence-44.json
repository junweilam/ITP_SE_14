Some offices try to promote fun and creativity, while others focus on efficiency and productivity. Creating an office environment to complement these values will play a major role in fostering culture. For example, an office that strives to promote creativity may want to place paintings, statues or whiteboards around the office.  For an office that places value in collaboration, having open work spaces may have more of a positive effect than cubicles.
