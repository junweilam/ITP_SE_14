Very rigorous interview process with multiple interviews usually each time with a group of 24 people and there is expectation for very detailed answers with examples from your past and how you dealt with issues that came up.,0.99759954,0.0022571133,0.00014329664
The interviewers are not that professional. Their oral english is awful. The way they dress is also less professional. The questions they asked are in a shorlist but not really related to my personal experience.,0.99880254,0.0010577906,0.00013967484

I first applied online and was informed to take the interview after 3 weeks of the closing date of the role. The interview lasted about an hour. I was interviewed by three local staff: the head of the team a manager from another team and the HR. All core questions are related to your previous working experience and the duties of the role. You'll  need to give examples to demostrate how you meet the requirements of the role. The interview was followed by a language skill test and the background check process.,0.8354455,0.16421583,0.00033859132
I was interviewed at Chongqing office by 2 Chinese staffs of BC Chongqing. One of them is the supervisor of the department Examination Distribution the other is Art Manager. The interview lasted 45 mins and they recorded the time. One thing I disliked in the interview was the interviewers were just reading a papersheet and asking you the questions on them word by word it was really not interactive and feeling like facetoface interview. It is more like a machineman oral test because they hardly gave you any direct/immediate responses to your answers just moved forward to next question without any interlinks.....,0.997743,0.0021298013,0.00012729467
If you are interviewing positions with any British Council office in China it will be very focused on your CV submitted. Be sure to prepare your mock questions and scratch your answers in advance. Good English is a much and make sure you have good conversation with the interviewers speak clearly is very important.,0.0019416091,0.9906911,0.0073673325
30 minutes by Skype with 2 interviewers.  Detailed application instructions were given beforehand that were matched to the BC core values to see if I qualified.  At least one interviewer was an examiner trainer.  The questions asked were fairly predictable.,0.9095465,0.09014722,0.0003062967
Only one round all competency based the interiewer were nice but it seemed that they prefer internal candidates and someone with ACCA background. The HR was nice the finance team was not very big the working hours were quite normal the salary was normally not negotiable and was disclosed in the job description.,0.0011793051,0.9963194,0.0025012877
Sent in CV and Cover Letter.  Interview was laid back.  Asked about what challenges I foresaw when teaching in China and whether I had an ideas for lessons,0.00043698607,0.99894565,0.0006172933
