Only one textbook is used - a snoozer called \"Unlock.\"\nEvery class is planned out in advance by some managers, so that, on any given day, months in advance, it has already been decided that this teacher will cover pages 80-82 in the book on this particular day. \nThere's virtually no room for creativity by the teachers.
