1. Employees have chances to enhance work productivity and efficiency by career development plan. This plan can be short training courses higher degrees etc. based on individual's needs and it is much greater that you can receive financial support (of course with conditions). 2. Employees can seek support from our peers and seek to belong to a group. The team always come together to deal with whatever problems are out there. Usually receiving letters from Mr. Presidents we feel a sense of unity and employees will no longer just feel that they’re working for themselves. We are now working towards something bigger than ourselves and as a team.,0.15466982,0.7418265,0.10350368

 Cannot use my name of choice for my email and company account.   MacBook users are not welcomed. Various systems only require access from their own devices which are Windows laptops. Their excuses are cybersecurity.   It's a British public body so it's highly bureaucratic.   Main reason I left: overworked staff are unhappy staff. Even when we work extra hours (at night and on our holidays) there is still more work to be done we constantly feel behind the job. The salary is no longer fair if counting the extra hours of work. My colleagues are dangerously exhausted for too long. Yet they have talks about mental health and meditation in the internal newsletter.   Even when you have excellent (internal) reviews and leave on good terms managers here won't give you a reference letter that mentions their job title or anything to do with British Council. It's quite ridiculous.  Most people seem to stay at their positions for a long time it makes opportunities of career development not very wide and even rare for young talents.,0.9984675,0.0012805789,0.00025183952

The university cares a lot about employee's wellbeing so there is no encouragement to work overtime. Their policy for annual leave and sick leave is generous as well (20 annual leave & 10 sick leave per year). This is very flexible for employees who are parents of small kids. Usually the salary of the starting point is higher than average market rate.,0.9980392,0.0016306251,0.00033013607
Once you start working it is very difficult to get promoted or get a raise in your salary. Since the policy of respecting wellbeing and generous paid leave scheme can be misused by some people. Some take excessive leave and leave behind a lot of workloads and messy situations where their colleagues have to support and work extra. In a way this is a horrendous and paradoxical situation when people usually in higher rank protect their wellbeing at the cost of overstepping on the wellbeing of people of lower rank.,0.99869424,0.0011184529,0.00018722568

 The university has had significant growth over the last 10 years and as such there has been instability with leadership / regulations / conditions of employment changing frequently.   Some lecturers have inflated expectations which can lead to an unsatisfactory experience; Melbourne is the hub for research.

Be sure you understand the balance between research and teaching and negotiate before joining. There could be greater professional development opportunities.

In the more than 5 years I worked at RMIT in Vietnam there were 3 restructures. These were often poorly thought out and communicated. Change appeared to be for changes sake and staff were not valued in the decisions.  There is very low morale in the academic areas of the university due to poor management skills. The services side of the university has a much better level or morale but these services do not appear to be valued by upper management.,0.99868125,0.0011734522,0.00014521708

Unethical and incompetent management practices.   No time or support for research. Colleagues will also have little time so working in teams is difficult. Conferences can only be attended between semesters and there are three. Funding is limited.   Insane policies including no textbooks (first year second language students benefit from this) compounded by no student materials to be older than three years. Basically impossible to support students with core theories that provide the grounding for all courses.   Management are allowed to bully and have been known to boast about the complaints against them. Unethical behavior that would not be allowed in Melbourne is ignored.   This will be a step backward for anyone wanting to be an active researcher. Your total research allocation is 6 hours per week but marking teaching and university service will eat into this   Staff are expected to be 'grateful' for their jobs  Staff survey results regrading their working conditions are ignored as apparently academics don't understand how to do surveys. Student surveys by 19 year old second language students on the other hand can determine your performance evaluations so staff need to inflate grades to keep students happy.,0.99856514,0.0012271297,0.00020772046

This is a teaching intensive university with three semesters per year. So there is a high teaching load and only two week breaks are possible. Unfortunately since 2014 the new president and vicepresident academics started ruling the place with iron fist turning the place into an employee's nightmare. The managerial structure has been restricted to few key figures who do not interact with the staff. Rules for promotion appraisal and workload assignment are very vague and arbitrary decisions are taken. Staff' morale is very low and the most competent people left in the last year or so. The level of teaching is low (college level) and getting worse because to increase declining enrollment entry requirements have been lowered to a point that one has to teach students who barely understand English and have difficulties in grasping elementary ideas. For this reasons courses content has been cut down midterm exams eliminated and final exams discouraged. Members of staff are required to carry out research but most of them cannot do it and there is no time or resources for it research culture is nonexistent.,0.9990907,0.00074909563,0.00016013668

This is a third rate substandard technical college that wrongly calls itself a university. Individuals have fake titles like Professor despite no research record. Thus there is no  future vision and the emphasis is on low standards to attract incompetent but rich students. All courses are weak and would not stand up to academic scrutiny even in a Vietnamese university. Lecturers are allowed to use readings and content only published in the last three years. Therefore students have absolutely zero knowledge of anything when they graduate and are not valued by the industry. Research is discouraged and staff are denied research time leading to substandard research which is never published in leading journals.

All the classes are for students who got too low an IELTS score and thus need preparatory classes to enter the regular university curriculum which includes no classes in literature or any other humanities fields.2) I would have to teach kids as young as 12 because a major source of the school's income derives from the weekend ""teens"" program which is also used as a way to groom girls and boys to eventually enroll in the ""university.""3) I would be required to teach seven days a week.4) Hourly instructors (all new hires in this department) do not get fulltime status for a year and a half on average but should expect to in fact work at least 40 hours per week while getting paid for half of that. Talk about exploitation.5) I would be observed and evaluated according to whether or not in a class for children I got the kids to get up and walk around to mingle with each other during activities.6) I would be expected to play various games with the children.7) One must be very techsavvy to be seen as an effective teacher in the program.8) Most of the teachers in this faux university English department come from a background of teaching children and goosestepping to the regimen instituted by the CambridgeCELTA ideology.9) All the teachers are stuck in one large office.10) The management is totally aloof dour and topheavy. I assumed given my wide experience as a college and university English teacher that the manager and others who interviewed and enthusiastically recruited me  knew perfectly well that I'm primarily a higher education teacher. It's crystalclear in my CV. I expected that I'd be teaching classes in literature public speaking critical thinking and maybe filmsurvey seminars as I'd done at other colleges and told the hiring committee about and which they reacted very positively to while conveniently failing to tell me that no such courses exist at RMIT.In a short period of time I found out that most of the fulltime staff in this department are deeply alienated because the management is so icy arrogant and clueless even as they have credentials such as a DELTA certificate to peacock about. The curriculum is so boring. Only one textbook is used  a snoozer called ""Unlock.""Every class is planned out in advance by some managers so that on any given day months in advance it has already been decided that this teacher will cover pages 8082 in the book on this particular day. There's virtually no room for creativity by the teachers. It's more like factory work.A fulltimer told me that he was specifically instructed not to bring in supplementary material.They have managers and regulations and ITfixations galore while the teachers almost universally see the program and its bosses to be worse than lame.Further there's an excessive emphasis on IT such that students in speaking classes are required to make videos instead of giving presentations before their peers.

How do you teach?  We were glorified baby sitters.  Many students had trouble understanding English and their writing was very bad.

"This is a hostile work environment particularly for women and people of color. Upper managers say things like ""lecturers can't be expected to keep track of the students when they're all named Ching Ding Ming or something."" Female staff are called ""girls"" told that the only thing they can do is take minutes in meetings and generally dismissed as inferior to their male counterparts in the same tier. Twoyear labour contracts are used as a convenient mechanism to dismiss staff based on personality clashes and they tend to be women and people of color. Managers come to work hungover or intoxicated and lash out and berate staff. Directions are constantly changing or contradictory. When staff ask for clarification on convoluted instructions they are frequently further berated. During the COVID19 lockdown staff were sent scathing emails from upper management telling them they should not be working from home even though line managers had given permission.  New rules and policies  are introduced in nearly every meeting leaving his staff scrambling to keep up and patch up the inconsistencies. At work functions managers are often extremely inebriated and groping one another including upper management in HR and another manager. This creates a hostile environment as well as a conflict of interest. No matter how unfairly managers may treat staff staff can never go to HR for impartial guidance and support and official complaints about conduct will never be taken seriously.   In addition to these issues there is no job security. Someone comes from Melbourne every few months and walks around the campus scrutinizing everyone and looking for people (and departments) to cut. Of course they say ""no one's going to lose their job"" but people lose their jobs every few months.  Overall it is a very hostile environment for anyone to work in particularly women and people of color and there is no job security. I would not wish this on anyone.",0.99892455,0.0009251806,0.00015030481
