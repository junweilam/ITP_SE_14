They were all very friendly and the 2 took turns to ask me questions. Overall the interview went very well, and it was a good experience. Jordan was very informative when I asked questions at the end and it gave me a good understanding of the role, what RHP does, and what RHP is like as an employer.\r\n\r\nThe 40 min psychometric test to be completed prior to interview (through a game-like app) was different to traditional tests and it was very challenging in my opinion. The feedback from this however was very insightful and more-or-less accurate!\r\n\r\nFollowing the interview I was asked to complete some tasks by the same day - one was a response to a customer's email, and the other was to order tasks based on priority and describe why. I was unsure about something in one of the tasks and Hannah was very quick to clarify it for me.\r\n\r\nOverall throughout the application and interview process Hannah kept me well informed. I greatly appreciated that despite not being offered the role (I had accepted another job offer and also this role wasn't the right fit for me), I received a call giving me feedback on how my interview went.", "Interview Questions": "Where do you see yourself in the future (in around 2-5 years time)?"}, {"date": "12 Dec 2020", "title": "Housing Officer Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at RHP", "Interview Descriptions": "Half a day process of various group activities and individual interview.
