I replied asking for feedback, and the admin person seemed confused that I had not received a phone call prior to her email and seemed under the impression I already knew. I advised her that her email was the first I knew about the outcome. She confirmed she would get someone to contact me with feedback. I did not hear anything, so a while later I repeated my request, but again nobody bothered to respond.

However, the recruitment team is by far the worst team for communication I have come across in any job search.\r\n\r\nI was invited for an initial telephone interview with a recruiter, who then did not call me as scheduled, I received a call the following week. Just general experience questions for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nI was then invited to another telephone interview with the hiring manager. It took 40 minutes. All situational questions. The manager was very friendly and forthcoming in answering my questions. He called when scheduled. I was told i would find out of my success by the end of the week on the Wednesday. I was not contacted at all, just sent an email invite to book in my face to face email on the following Tuesday.\r\n\r\nFor the face to face interview i had to prepare a presentation. For this i put a lot of time and effort into creating and rehearsing. Following the presentation i answering more situational interview questions. At the end of the interview i was told i would be contacted at the end of the week to be told if i have been successful.\r\n\r\nI contacted the recruiter at the end of the week as it was nearing the end of the day and was then told that I will be contacted on the Monday. \r\n\r\nFrom there i have heard nothing. It has been a following two weeks so i presume i have not been successful even though they have not updated their recruitment portal and it still states pending.\r\n\r\nConsidering the amount of time and effort i had put into the interview process the least a company can do is inform the candidate if they are successful or not. It is rude and given me a horrible impression of the company as a whole.
