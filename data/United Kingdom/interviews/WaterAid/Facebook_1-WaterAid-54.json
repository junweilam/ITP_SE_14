First screening interview was just as expected with usual questions (what excites you about this job, why WaterAid etc). This was with the hiring manager and current team member who were really friendly and made me feel at ease straight away. Following the screening I was given a problem statement and a week or so to create a presentation on an idea to generate more income for WaterAid. I was also given 7 questions in advance to prepare answers. These covered topics like how to measure innovation, experience with prototyping, what support I would need to thrive in the role. Although the presentation required quite a lot of prep, I appreciated having the time to prepare answers and having the bulk of the interview process done in one go. The final interview was with the head of department and hiring manager. Again, they were very friendly and it felt like a two-way conversation where I could really get to grips with what life at WaterAid would be like and what they were looking for. In this interview we covered a bit more about my previous experience and skills, what I might find challenging about the role.", "Interview Questions": "What excites you about this role?

I could understand further deliberation for a permanent role but I had to wait anxiously the whole weekend not knowing. I then had to chase this again on Monday and found out late afternoon that I didn\u2019t get it. It was quite a junior role and I have a lot of experience so did ask for feedback as that would be helpful to me going forward to know where I went wrong. Never received any feedback.

The interview involved around 10 questions and a presentation on a specialist area of WaterAid. Some of the questions required the same answers and were worded just a little bit differently. The interviewees seemed polite and nice, however the hiring manager turned their camera off (on both rounds) so that was a bit disconcerting when interviewing as it was hard to pick up on body language. I made it through to the second round and it was another load of questions and a task that according to the hiring manager would usually be shared prior to interview but they wanted to know a gut reaction. I answered as best as I could and then was later informed that I wasn\u2019t chosen. I completely understand not being chosen, it\u2019s a competitive field. What concerned me was the language and reasoning behind why I wasn\u2019t chosen. The phrasing was \u201cIf it was a different region, it could have been a different story\u201d this is open to a lot of interpretation and so I followed up asking for feedback. The hiring manager asked if she could share this with me after her leave, I asked if it could be done beforehand as I have other interviews lined up and would really like to learn where I can improve, I received the hiring managers out of office. It has now been a week since the hiring manager has returned from leave and just over two weeks since the interview, I\u2019ve still not received any feedback. Considering the time and preparation they expect from a candidate to put into an interview, this is really poor form. The people who I had spoke to in interview had been working at WaterAid for 10+years, and I can\u2019t help but believe they have forgotten what it is like to be on the other side, and just how valuable feedback is to a candidate. I later learned from a friend I have in the sector that someone has joined WaterAid recently and has been in tears daily from the pressure.
