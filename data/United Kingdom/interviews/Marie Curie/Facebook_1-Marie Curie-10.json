The team was very understanding of availability. The Interview took place in Glasgow to the Marie Curie Hospice, and it required to wear masks which cause some difficulties at least for me. Few days after the interview, I received a call and a voice message thinking it would be a positive feedback or at least a good one even if negative. I had been asked to call back, I did and then I received an email with the rejection and shortly put that I did perform well at the interview and I was not selected. I asked for further feedback and I never heard back.

The first thing they did was take a photo of me with hardly an explanation behind it, I thought this was very bizarre and I felt immediately awkward. Neither interviewer displayed any particular interest in getting to know me during the 20 mins interview (far too short a time if you ask me), the questions were very basic but they didn\u2019t even ask me for my notice period or salary expectations to align me properly to the job. A big clue they weren\u2019t interested. For a 20 minute interview I feel I should have been telephone screened prior to the first stage interview so they at least had my basic info. I was barely given an opportunity to ask questions - it seemed that both interviewers were keen to leave and/or forgot to let me ask questions. I just about squeezed one in at the end, and due to the answer given to me I already knew I wasn\u2019t successful during the interview. The interviewer answered my question in a way that implied I will not get to work with Marie Curie first hand. After chasing up on the outcome (I already knew I didn\u2019t get it - but it\u2019s the principal), my feedback was a pretty cold, standardised email with no personal touch \u201cwe have decided to progress with other candidates with skills that better align with the role\u201d... in which case I don\u2019t understand why I was shortlisted if it\u2019s a case of skill set which my CV outlines.
