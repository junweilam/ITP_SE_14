This has been the line for the last three weeks.\n\nI have completed vetting before for previous roles so I was aware these things could take up to 6 weeks. But now I am looking for another job because I cannot wait any longer and no one seems to do anything towards getting myself, and the other three new starters on board.", "Interview Questions": "usual compliance based questions"}, {"date": "16 Mar 2023", "title": "Engagement and Culture Coordinator Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Nacro (London, England) in Dec 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "Very straightforward and the feedback was spot on .this has helped me with my other interviews and has opened up my thought process.I would have loved working with an organization like nacro but unfortunately couldn\u2019t clear their interview which was ver6 organized and done by extremely professional staff of nacro", "Interview Questions": "Why Nacro and what is it about Nacro that attracted you"}], []]
