Both of the interviewers were leaving the company. In the case of the CTO he wasn\u2019t being replaced, which I found very odd, but apparently the board had decided that the company didn\u2019t need a CTO. Based on what they said I\u2019m not entirely sure they know what they want for the data department either, but I wasn\u2019t able to find out more on this as there was no time allotted for questions from candidates. The interview started slightly late and I was rushed through every question. Typically I would start answering, and then the CTO would interject and ask a follow up question before telling me that we were behind schedule. The CTO checked his phone on a few occasions and  told me that he had to reply to a business message that was sent otherwise there would be an outage. I found this to be unprofessional, but to be fair he did apologise.  It seemed to me that he was very much needed after all. \n\nMy main frustration was that there were too many questions for the time allotted. The fact that they didn\u2019t even have my cv in front of them, made it more difficult. Their feedback to the recruitment consultant was that my answers were not concise enough, indicating that I would struggle with their stakeholders. My feedback to them would be - it is impossible to give top three career highlights in 2 minutes when you are asked follow up questions almost as soon as you start answering. Frustratingly even before the interview, they questioned my suitability as they said that it wasn\u2019t obvious from my cv that I had the skills and experience to deal with their apparently difficult stakeholders. This is despite my nearly 20 years experience with the technology stack they are using, and the fact that my current job title is Product Manger. Obviously stakeholder management is a big part of my role. The equally frustrated rec con told me that the feedback about me was almost identical to feedback to the previous candidate, who had said the same thing about his interview, and they had said the same thing about him.\n\nIt was difficult to set up a time for the interview in the first place as both the interviewers and myself were very busy with work. I moved a few things around to fit into one of the few time slots that they could make, but I don\u2019t feel I had their full attention or that I got a fair crack at it. They were obviously preoccupied with the sport relief campaign and maybe it was a bad time for them. I have a very good record at interviews and am confident that I could have been successful in the job. The suggestion that I didn\u2019t have the skills or experience is frankly ridiculous. If anything it would have been a step down from what I am currently doing, as the development team at comic relief is half the size of my current team and my responsibilities in my current role outweigh those of the job advertised.  Without revealing where I work, I can\u2019t  imagine comic relief stakeholders being more difficult than my current stakeholders, and would have welcomed a chance to talk to them and let them make a call instead of two people who were leaving the company. Before the interview I was very keen to work there and would have been prepared to take a pay cut to work for a charity such as this, but it\u2019s possible that I\u2019ve dodged a bullet.", "Interview Questions": "List your top 3 career highlights"}, {"date": "25 Nov 2015", "title": "Events Assistant Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1+ week.\u00a0I interviewed at Comic Relief", "Interview Descriptions": "30 minute task, writing an email reply.
