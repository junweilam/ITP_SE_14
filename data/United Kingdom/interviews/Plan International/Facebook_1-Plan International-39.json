Was contacted to arrange an interview over a month after applying for the job. I did the interview at very short notice (several hours notice only). The interview lasted 1hr 15 mins and was 100% aimed at ascertaining if I shared the values of Plan International, by asking me a number of questions based around those values. I wasn't asked any questions about my experience or what I had been doing, no questions about my CV etc. I was told that they always do first interviews like this based only on the values. At the end of the interview I was told that they would be moving quickly and that they would get back to me with the outcome of the first interview in a 'couple of days'. A week later I'd not heard anything so I emailed chasing for an update, but I did not get any reply. Two weeks later and still no reply or update since the interview unfortunately. I can appreciate the importance of values and so understand why they wanted to see if I fit. But values do work both ways, and they didn't demonstrate one of their own values - doing what they say they will (ie letting me know the outcome in a couple of days). In the current climate especially, candidate experience is very important. Candidates applying for jobs do need to be shown some empathy I think, and not ghosted.", "Interview Questions": "Can you give us an example of a time when you have helped further the causes of women and young girls"}, {"date": "19 Jul 2022", "title": "DRM Project Manager Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Plan International (Stoke-on-Trent, England) in Jun 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "The process started with a phone screening, which was conducted by the HR staff members.  \r\nThen a panel of technical people interviewed me,  The focus was on understanding more about skills and competencies.
