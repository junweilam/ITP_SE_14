I was made to feel very welcome by my interviewees. Format is formal - the panel had about 10 questions to ask me which were obviously from a script designed by Cats Protection. I was not offered the job and received feedback that was constructive, but in some ways also quite unfair. I think going forward Cats Protection would benefit from moving away from the archaic \"one size fits all\" questions and tailoring their questions to the individual, based on their background and experience. There were a couple of questions I had to ask for further clarification for, and one in particular, which I think was what cost me the job offer, was unnecessarily vague in its wording, even after asking them to elaborate. Interview questions should be accessible to all - generic questions lead to generic answers. To be told in feedback I didn't have a good understanding of something that is critical in my current role was disappointing to say the least! However, it isn't deterring me from applying again one day as it's a wonderful organization. I just hope Cats Protection have taken a second look at their interviewing process and techniques by then.", "Interview Questions": "What do you know about Cats Protection?

The following day, I received a phone call offering me the job, which I accepted. Following this, I was invited to an induction. No unpaid trial day was required (which I have had with similar jobs).
