I was surprised that there was no editorial or practical element to the interview process whatsoever. \r\n\r\nIn the interview they glanced at the work and just asked me a couple of questions about it. \r\nAll their questions seemed to be a box ticking exercise, they weren't looking for a candidate who was actually a good content writer but one who was able to shoehorn whatever experience they had done into answers to their formulaic management-speak questions. When I was told by email that I hadn't got the job, I asked for feedback, and was sent an unnecessarily harsh email by the interviewer explaining how much worse I was than the successful candidate and how I didn't seem to know anything about the company, which was completely untrue. They seemed to have mistaken my nervousness for lack of research. Certainly a learning experience.\r\n\r\nI am astounded that for an editorial / content role, they didn't want to test how well the candidates could write.
