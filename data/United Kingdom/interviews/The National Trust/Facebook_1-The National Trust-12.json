Entered with all my belongings and the manageress interviewing me didn\u00b4t give me any time to sit down and get comfortable but immediately laid out a pre-interview activity, although I had arrived 10 minutes early and hadn\u00b4t been told this would be happening. \r\n\r\nRest of the interview was with two manageresses one was fine and the other, of the main site who had given me the activity, rushed through and was fairly bolsh. She was wearing an extremely low cut top which I found extremely unprofessional and made me feel really uncomfortable. She also asked me questions about how I would provide a great, friendly customer service when she was providing none of that herself at all. She rushed through the questions and when I had answered my last one she stood up and said \"Thanks for coming\" before the other interviewer could say, \"Hang on, do you have any questions to ask us?\". Felt like I was just one of a number on a conveyor belt she had to get through and she made it clear she was quite tired. Tried to make friendly chit chat but she wasn\u00b4t interested and I got sent out of the room not knowing where to head to (I needed the toilets but she closed the door behind me in such a rush, couldn\u00b4t get me out of there fast enough it seems...)\r\n\r\n\r\nI then didn\u00b4t hear anything for a week and emailed her to ask if the position had been filled. She just said she had been very busy and gave no apology, but no, I hadn\u00b4t got the job. I wonder if she would have even got back to me if I hadn\u00b4t contacted her.
