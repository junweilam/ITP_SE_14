She then made a \"hmmmm\" noise and said well to be honest this is not within our range\u201d which made it sound like I earn too little/much for this job (again, no idea how much that was meant to be - it was the same job title as I have now). \r\n\r\nFor the rest of the interview the recruiter was very snobbish and condescending, saying how \u201cwe get a lot of people applying from smaller organisations like you, but because we are the largest org in UK they just don\u2019t cut it for us\u201d. A bit of a pointless comment then, since you are the largest, obviously everyone else is smaller? Why invite me for an interview? Then she tried to bring me down every way possible saying \u201call OUR HR staff are very STRATEGIC, they do a lot of STRATEGY\u201d. She didn\u2019t seem to be able to explain what that meant, so my guess is that she had no understanding of the role whatsoever and was just hung up on repeating the word \u201cstrategy\u201d. I told her of my experience doing strategic projects and managing teams but it didn\u2019t seem to matter too much. \r\n\r\nShe then said \u201cwell I will be having words with hiring manager but either way we will get in touch with the outcome in a few weeks\u201d. Needless to say this was months ago and I never heard back! Giving feedback and letting people know is essentially this woman\u2019s job - the ONE job she is specifically hired to do. But no.\r\n\r\nThen, funnily enough, I got approached with this same role but not directly - by an agency, who marketed it as \u201cjunior\u201d role and mentioned the salary - and there was nothing overly \u201cstrategic\u201d about it, although in the interview this was sold to me as a \u201csenior strategic role\u201d basically out of my reach because I am doing the same job but at a smaller place. Genius. \r\n\r\nI believe this organisation thinks it can afford to have rubbish candidate experiences, take months to make decisions, not keep candidates updated, talk down to them etc and still get the best talent - I don\u2019t think so.
