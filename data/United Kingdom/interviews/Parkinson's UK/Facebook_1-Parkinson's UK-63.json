The focus of this task was something of a surprise, as the job description had not mentioned numerical targets or data analysis, although I am familiar with these. The task was lengthy for the time allocated. \r\n\r\nI was interviewed via Google Hangouts by a panel of three.  The questions were lengthy and I think they all involved multiple parts, preceded by the panel reading out statements about Parkinson's UK. I found it difficult to focus my answers while trying to remember the different aspects of each question. \r\n\r\nThe panel members were otherwise friendly and professional.\r\n\r\nSix days after being interviewed, I got a system-generated email saying no job offer was being made.", "Interview Questions": "How do you feel about Parkinson's UK carrying out research using animal testing?"}, {"date": "15 Dec 2020", "title": "Copywriter Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Parkinson's UK (London, England) in Jul 2019", "Interview Descriptions": "Brief task comprising copy-editing and copywriting.

I was not able to make the initial interview time but they made an effort to offer an alternative slot.  The interview process involved meeting the head of team, an interview with competency questions, and lastly a 10 minute presentation with Q&A. I enjoyed the three stage process. Meeting the head of team at the outset helped put me at ease and enabled me to find out a bit more about the role.  I also got to meet a number of team members so it felt like a more two way process and enabled me to get a feel for the culture of the organisation.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not get offered the role the outcome was communicated to me promptly  and I appreciate that I was given detailed verbal feedback and advice that will help me in the future.", "Interview Questions": "What do you think is meant by HR Business Partnering?"}, {"date": "23 Nov 2017", "title": "Analyst Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Parkinson's UK", "Interview Descriptions": "Good and quick process had named contact with HR.
