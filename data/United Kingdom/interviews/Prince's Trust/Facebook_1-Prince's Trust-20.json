After all, I was busy applying to lots of other vacancies elsewhere, so it would be useful to be certain about what had happened to my application to The Prince's Trust and to receive feedback that could help me in future interviews.  \r\n\r\nInitially there was no response. Then, almost a month after the interview, I got an email confirming that my application was unsuccessful. I was told some feedback would be sent my way soon. However, it has still not appeared. \r\n\r\nI understand The Prince's Trust staff are stretched and busy and that contacting unsuccessful job applicants isn't going to be their number one priority, but I still think this is a pretty shoddy way to treat people that undermines The Prince's Trust's reputation. I put in a huge amount of time and effort reading up on the organisation, working on my application and preparing for the interview. It's not unreasonable to expect confirmation of whether I'd got the job or not within a two week timeframe...or at least an update on when I could expect to hear from them. I came to GlassDoor and saw reviews suggesting previous applicants had the same sort of experience. \r\n\r\nIt's certainly affected my opinion of The Prince's Trust as a charity: if they're disorganised in this way, what other parts of the organisation aren't providing a good service? And if I had got the job, would it actually have been a supportive place to work? I've since secured a job elsewhere and can't help but think it's maybe for the best I didn't end up at The Prince's Trust.", "Interview Questions": "Give an example of planning a project"}, {"date": "7 Dec 2017", "title": "Head of Communications Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 6 months.\u00a0I interviewed at Prince's Trust (London, England)", "Interview Descriptions": "Actual interview was okay.
