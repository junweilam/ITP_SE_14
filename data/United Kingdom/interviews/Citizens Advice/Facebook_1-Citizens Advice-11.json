Did my research, spoke to many other people who had worked or volunteered for Citizen\u2019s Advice and was told about their great online training scheme and what a great place it was to work. Was really excited to interview,  but I wouldn\u2019t have exactly called it one.\n\nI arrived and was in and out within about 15 minutes or so. There was one single interviewer, who mixed up my degree with one on another person\u2019s application and that was the first red flag. I didn\u2019t have much of a chance to speak and felt the whole interview was just the interviewer talking at me - very informal. \n\nThe interviewer went over the job title, contract and benefits and spoke about the role (rather negatively, without much enthusiasm). They also told me how long they would be doing interviews for that day as if it was a hassle, not the most professional. It was almost as if the interviewer was trying to deter me from the job with the way it was being discussed and I knew from that point there would not be an employment offer. \n\nAt one point I was asked to tell the interviewer about myself, the only chance I really had to speak. They explained that they\u2019re looking for someone who pretty much knows exactly how to do the job already, as they don\u2019t have the resources or staff to train anyone. This left me rather confused as:\n\na) I had been informed by multiple people of their extensive online training and,\n\nb) in that case, why would they hold external interviews as opposed to an internal recruitment process?\n\nThe interviewer confirmed with me again that I had not volunteered previously, and without saying the words made it quite clear that they were looking for someone who had. Luckily, I was contacted only a few hours after the interview to be told I was unsuccessful due to my lack of experience and again how they needed someone who could do the job with no training.\n\nI believe that if they required someone who had volunteered in the past, this should have been specified on the job advert. Just by comparing my application forms with the other candidates, it was evident I hadn\u2019t volunteered or held this exact position before - so I really have no idea why I was invited to interview. \n\nI was really disappointed with the interview process and expected so much better. I felt that my time had been wasted, as I wasn\u2019t going to be hired anyway due to not meeting the criteria that the interviewer had and knew I didn\u2019t meet after reading my application. I do believe that there was perhaps an interviewing quota that had to be met, and best case I was known not to be suitable beforehand, or worst case, someone was already chosen for the role and this was simply going through the motions.\n\nThe whole experience was very disheartening and draining. I would like to remind recruiters and interviewers alike, that applicants are real people with real lives and commitments. Should someone not meet (undisclosed) criteria from reading their application, please do not waste their time and energy interviewing them if there is absolutely no chance they were in the running for the role anyway.\n\nI would urge future applicants/interviewees alike to be prepared for this scenario. This was just my experience of one bureau, and may not well be the case for anyone else.
