The job was posted end of December 2020 and I started in my new role on 17th February so the entire process felt very efficient, especially the timeline once it was actually in the hands of the Marketing Manager. I was called the day after my interview and offered the job and I started exactly three weeks later (to allow for equipment and tech set up) which I felt was an incredibly speedy timeline. \r\n\r\nThe interview was done by the marketing manager and the director of business development, which felt like an amazing amount of attention for an assistant role, and both were very friendly and welcoming and I felt at ease as soon as I joined the call. In fact, I was actually unsuccessful in an application for a more senior role, but rather than a rejection, I was asked to interview for a more suitable role (considering this is my first grad job).\r\n\r\nI found the actual interview a genuinely enjoyable experience which is a rare thing to be able to say - I was asked to create a presentation with some specific details and I felt it really gave me a chance to show what I could do with my own creative touch. The interview questions were fairly standard and nothing felt out of the blue or not applicable to the role I was applying for. I also felt supported to find the right answer which was lovely, so if I didn't answer the exact question, it was rephrased, so I was given the chance to give the best answer possible. \r\n\r\nOverall a fantastic experience, and I'm now in my second week of work and the onboarding and induction process is so thorough and welcoming, especially considering the challenges we're all experiencing working from home.", "Interview Questions": "Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation that answers the following questions: briefly tell us about yourself and your interest in this role, share with us some of your content/graphic design work and experience, tell us about a project you're proud of."}, {"date": "24 Feb 2021", "title": "Media and PR Officer Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at The Vegan Society (Birmingham, England) in Nov 2020", "Interview Descriptions": "I had a remote (Teams) interview for The Vegan Society in Nov 2020. While the interview was set up by an outsourced HR company, I was interviewed by two senior members of staff from the Comms Dept who were both friendly, warm and welcoming. I find remote interviews can be particularly challenging as you don't always get a sense of the company, job or potential colleagues but I felt very much at ease. The process was quite long - I think about 1hr 15 mins - but I did talk a lot. I've had interviews for similar roles previously but enjoyed this one the most. I loved that they took the time to explain more about the company, the office space and how they were working during the pandemic. It was one of those interviews where I came away fully confident in what was expected of me but also the benefits I could get in return. They went into detail about the role and the requirements so nothing really came as a surprise when I started. The interview also included some practical assessments including a practice radio interview (as the role required being a spokesperson on behalf of the company).

It was called \u2018the pros and cons of various staff time recording systems\u2019. \r\nIt didn\u2019t explicitly state that there would be more interview questions, and considering the size of the task I thought that would be the main deciding factor. So I spent all day every day for a week on this presentation. \r\n\r\nThere did end up being further interview questions however, and I was told I didn\u2019t get the job because I didn\u2019t answer the questions sufficiently, which seemed perfectly fair, but it made me realise that the presentation actually had little to do with the decision-making process.\r\n\r\nThe interviewers even said during the interview that a staff time recording system is something that they were actually going to implement for the charity, so this makes me think that they were just taking advantage of hopeful candidates by getting them to do their research for them. They even asked me to send them a copy of my presentation 'to make sure it worked on their computer system when i got there to present it', which they clearly didn't because it didn't work when i got there. So why did they ask me to send it over?  \r\n\r\nThere were delays throughout the whole process, including after the interview for the second role. I sent two emails politely requesting some feedback after it was clear I hadn\u2019t got the job. My emails were ignored and after the whole, difficult process I was a little irritated. This led me to email again pointing out I had been ignored; I got an immediate email, and a phone call back! Telling me that as a vegan, I should understand that she didn't have time to reply to candidate emails and not complain. \r\n\r\nI get the impression, from talking to those involved and from the other reviews on this website that  because the Society does good work for the animals, they feel they have an excuse to treat people badly.", "Interview Questions": "What recent health and safety legislation are you aware of"}, {"date": "6 Mar 2018", "title": "Fundraising and Partnership Manager Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at The Vegan Society (Birmingham, England) in Feb 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "I was interviewed by a panel of two at The Vegan Society's office in Birmingham.
