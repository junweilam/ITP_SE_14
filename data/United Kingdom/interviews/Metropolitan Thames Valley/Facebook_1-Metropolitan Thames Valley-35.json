Know your controller-model-view, adding data to your database etc. Ensure you know how to use your github too (It's obvious but just incase) . Overall, it's not hard, just go over your rails and you should be good.\r\n\r\nThe con is, after the interview, no feedback is provided which I think leaves a bad impression on the company, regardless how nice they are at each stage. Considering the time you spent preparing and all the effort that goes into applying for a job. I think it would be really nice if companies spared at least 5minutes to explain why a candidate isn't selected, especially if you keep saying you 'really enjoyed this interview' at the end of it.
