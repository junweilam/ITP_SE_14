Stage 1 was submission of a CV and covering letter. Next was an online presentation over Zoom to a 3-person panel incl. a few questions about your background and why you want to work there. The final leg was described as a more in-depth online interview about competencies together with a data science problem that you work through while treating the panel as subject area experts.\r\n\r\nI didn't make it to the final stage so I can't comment on that.\r\n\r\nI received an email inviting me to interview about a month after the closing date for applications. They notified me just over 2 weeks before the interview, allowing me plenty of time to prepare the 10min presentation that they requested (was not required to submit this prior to the interview date). The topic was either an algorithm that you believe is important to data science or scripts demonstrating good research software engineering practices.\r\n\r\nIntroductions with the panel were brief and friendly before launching into the presentation. They were very engaged and asked interesting questions throughout the presentation. Initially, these were familiarising questions and clarified how well the models apply to the problem I'd chosen. Once we moved onto the code, questions were a mix of explaining how specific functions work, together with good software engineering practice questions e.g. how would you improve this section of the code (think testing, variable naming, documentation), how would you make this machine readable etc. At the beginning, the panel advised that I could take my time to think through answers so I didn't feel rushed. Due to the number of questions the presentation took maybe 30-40mins.\r\n\r\nAfter that they spent a short while asking me some general questions about my work history, why I wanted to work there and inviting questions from me. The entire interview ran to about an hour.\r\n\r\nI got a response within a few days. I requested some feedback and I was impressed with the quality of the pointers they provided over email.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was a positive experience.

Although I didn't get the job it was nice to receive feedback via telephone after the interview. However, I should note a few points about the interview process.\r\n\r\n- The online interview arrangement system doesn't work well. Although I confirmed my attendance, HR emailed me a few days before asking me to confirm as they hadn't seen my confirmation.\r\n\r\n- I was asked to provide my presentation 24 hours before interview which was quite a rush as it was my last week of work at another job. In the end this 24 hour deadline was not necessary as we just ended up using the version on my laptop.\r\n\r\n- Up until the moment I sat down in the interview, I had not been told that there would be two interviews on separate days. Not in the job description, and not anywhere in email communications had this been explained. Not a big deal but it threw me off a little. I was expecting a single interview.\r\n\r\nOverall I would say this, nice to get feedback, generally nice people, very disorganised application process. I would add that it felt very strange being asked to launch straight into deep technical discussion without first some niceties discussing the role itself, what would be expected of me, and what made me apply. Perhaps that's what the 2nd interview would have been for, but if so the order of things should be reversed.
