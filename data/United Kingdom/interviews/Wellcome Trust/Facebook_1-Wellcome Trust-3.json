I promptly responded on the same day, providing my availability as requested. On June 7, I received two emails from the Talent Acquisition Specialist, confirming the screening call for June 9 and asking me to arrange the first and final interview with the hiring manager (I was given specific timeslots to choose from). During the initial call on June 9, I specifically enquired about the expected timeframe for receiving feedback, to which I was informed that it would be within 1 week to 10 days. I had the interview on Monday, June 12, after receiving interview details and preparation information on Friday, June 9, at 5:46 PM. As I had not received any communication from the Talent Acquisition Specialist, I sent an enquiry on June 27 to enquire about the outcome of my application and request feedback. I received an automated reply stating that the Talent Acquisition Specialist would be away until July 3. However, the application system still indicates that my application is \"in progress,\" and to this day, I have not received any updates or feedback regarding my application.\" The above text was part of the feedback that I provided to the organisation. I received on the same a missed call and a voice message from Talent Acquisition asking me to inform them of my availability within the next couple of days to have a call to give me feedback on my application.
