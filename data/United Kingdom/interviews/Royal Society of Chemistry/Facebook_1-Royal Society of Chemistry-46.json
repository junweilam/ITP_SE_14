This exercise was to test your ability to work in a team, general communication skills and ability to plan. This was a fun exercise and the best part of the day.\r\nThe competency based interview was the usual type of questions, \"Tell me a time when...\", but the company did not inform candidates in which style to answer the questions. Candidates were penalised for using a STAR not SHARE approach with the interviewers not correcting/prompting myself to switch style and explain the SHARE approach. The interviewers were also unresponsive and unfriendly and made the atmosphere hostile and unwelcoming.\r\nThe tour of the Royal Society of Chemistry, in principle sounds exciting, however consisted of a tour around several offices and was unnecessary as everyone knows what an office looks like. In addition, this tour added another hour onto an already long day. Although this tour would have been fine if done at the end of the day. The tour did allow the opportunity to ask staff about the company, but again was pointless as directly after the tour there was a 90 minute section to ask employees about the company!\r\nThere were three individual exercises at the end of the day which were: editing a journal, picking keywords from 6 full length journals and writing two emails, all within 90 minutes. \r\nThe editing a journal was a good exercise and allowed candidates to understand what the role would involve. However, the journal had been altered so significantly, by the interviewers, that it was almost impossible to follow and if had been received by a real editor would have been binned immediately. \r\nThe objective of the keyword exercise was not clearly explained and was an unfair attempt by the interviewers to ascertain whether candidates had a \"broad chemistry knowledge\" despite the fact the exercise was very subjective. An exam or writing an abstract would have been more appropriate, with most candidates being unhappy with this task. \r\nThe final exercise involved writing two emails to customers to understand if the candidates written communication was acceptable. Again the explanation of what to do was poor and candidates were given too little information to write an appropriate email response. This task also involved writing the email by hand, which is not the usual way of working, so candidates who have poor hand writing and spelling were penalised. Despite the fact these issues would not have been a problem if the exercise was done on a computer.\r\nFinally, the company failed to send me an email or phone me with their decision/feedback.
