Pretty much standard. I was asked to do a video interview,  video interview for a job that is on the phones? I don't believe in that, I find it very invasive and not age appropriate for some, especially those that have not been brought up in the age of technology or for those that have and can be quite self conscious with their appearance.  I was invited for an interview and wow....just wow. There were 8 of us, 4 of which must have been nominated by people already working there, as they were saying hello to everyone. 4 decided to take total control of the group activity, not letting anyone have an opinion. This particular activity being about what you would do if stranded in the middle of nowhere.   We were then divided then in to two groups, one group went to do a pretend telephone call and write an email. Coincidentally it just  happened to be the group that knew everyone at the company already.  The other group were interviewed.  My interview comprised of the interviewer not really showing much interest in my answers, just looking everywhere other than at me, even out of the window into the corridor to see who was passing.    One of the  questions  is why do you want to leave your job?   Another one is what is the proudest moment of your career up to date?   I might have well as talked to a brick wall.  This interviewer didn't even ask if I had any questions about the company. I knew then that I hadn't got the job.  So next a pretend game of answering the phone and writing an email and basically wasting my time. A pretend game as they had already made their decision.  A couple of days later when the email came, (not a phone call) that I hadn't got the job, I was not in the slightest surprised. I did ask for feed back, which I was told would happen in up to 5 working days.  Yep, I received the call on the last day, at the very last moment possible and then when I rang back it went to the call centre and I was stuck in a very long queue for around 15 minutes until I realised that basically they just couldn't be bothered or professional enough to give me a direct line number or any feedback, probably didn't like me saying I felt the interviewer was totally unprofessional .

From the moment I entered the room, the female had an air of arrogance about her and was completely rude and standoffish. Throughout the interview whenever the man was asking me questions, she would look at him sideways, almost as though she were mocking my responses. Her questions to me were repetitive and vague - the times I asked her to elaborate or what she meant, she would say just respond that it was open to my interpretation. How on earth does that make sense and give the opportunity to tailor a response to the role I am applying for?! Her attitude absolutely stunk and she is definitely not someone I would have enjoyed working underneath. There were also times were I was explaining things I had done in my previous role and team to which she constantly made sarcastic remarks to her colleague interviewing me such as \u201coh, it sounds like we\u2019re in the wrong job\u201d. There were also questions where I was specifically asked about my previous role and when I responded she asked \u201cwho is we? You say we a lot\u201d - well, considering I was a part of one of the largest companies in the entire U.K. and working within a team, my answer will include a \u201cwe\u201d since I didn\u2019t run the entire section singlehandedly. \n\nTotally impossible to feel comfortable being interviewed by her and quite frankly for a temporary position the need to be interviewed in such a hostile environment was totally unnecessary. Wish I saw all these Glassdoor reviews before agreeing to attend the interview. \n\nI was also required to do a written test which didn\u2019t factor into account the need to read four pages of information before completing the task and also the fact that they said the test had started, and then proceeded to talk to me about an impending fire alarm and give me an emergency phone number to contact if the laptop died, cutting down the time to do the task even further. But as I said from the outset the female interviewer had such a bad body language and energy towards me, constantly giving me dirty looks than she no doubt did this on purpose and didn\u2019t care that I would run out of time.", "Interview Questions": "How do you prioritise your workload"}, {"date": "7 Sept 2018", "title": "Customer Service Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at The Guinness Partnership (Oldham, England) in Sept 2018", "Interview Descriptions": "COMPLETE DISGRACE.
