On the morning of the interview I met the head nurse and we had a one-on-one interview and the first question that she asked me if I was local had I travelled far and then this took me back and it showed me that she had not reviewed my details and did not have the due diligence to check key information about candidates such as location. She then asked me a variety of common interview questions about my experiences and then the interview was concluded. I received a email about a week later to say that I hadn\u2019t got the job because of practical experience, even though I had a years worth of work experience in a veterinary practice where I did all basic practical tasks and outside of this. I also had experience in several other different animal settings, where I did all aspects of practical, animal, husbandry and care. The only part of the job role that I did not have experience with was receptionist experience and experience of animal anaesthesia. I was very surprised when she asked me if I had animal anaesthesia experience, as this really should not be a responsibility of a veterinary care assistant, and the extent to which the veterinary care assistant role has come to have such a broad scope of responsibilities, breaching into clinical duties, where they really should not be doing them, and it should be the responsibility of a veterinary surgeon, and a veterinary nurse highlighted to me what appears to be a declining level of standards in the veterinary industry. In my application, I mentioned nothing about having experience of animal anaesthesia, monitoring or receptionist experience, so it shows to me that they had not properly reviewed my CV in relation to what they supposedly wanted, and showed no real respect for what I had invested in the interview process up until that point.", "Interview Questions": "Tell me about your experiences"}, {"date": "22 Dec 2022", "title": "VCA Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 1 day.\u00a0I interviewed at PDSA (Brighton, England) in Dec 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "This was an all day interview, team building activities and 1:1 interview questions followed with a tour around the hospital.
