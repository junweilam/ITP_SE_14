When they were finally set up. Weeks later than expected. It took several more than a month before I was invited for my first interview. Thereafter it was almost 2 months before I heard back. Granted, Covid had just hit so I gave benefit of doubt. But thereafter it was a series of following up, being told to expect feedback or an interview date within a certain time frame, not hearing back within said time frame and it took another month just to get an interview date. After the 2nd interview I didn't hear back for almost 2 months and it was the same back and forth. I felt really disappointed in the process.

The next round was a lot more intense and required a competency interview and a task which in total was 3 and a half hours. I put a lot of effort in, and was disappointed that when I was told I was unsuccessful I wasn't given any feedback. I felt that it wasn't particularly thoughtful or sensitive to jobseekers who should be able to learn something  from the recruitment experience. When I asked for feedback a few weeks later I received data showing my answers compared to the top answers and from what I could see I did really well, so I didn't really learn anything from the experience. It was ironic because in my interview I had talked about the importance of quantitative and qualitative data, and I would have really benefitted from one of the interviewers taking the time just to write a couple of lines about what could have been improved.
