In the group interview, there were ten of us (quite a large number!) and we broke off into two groups. We were given 8 descriptions of videos, and had to to detail how we could gain publicity for each one. We then fed back to the group. \r\nStrangely, we then had to fill out essentially another application form again, independently. We were only given 20 minutes to do this, and the interviewer was pressurizing us all to hurry up and finish writing every so often. It was a very lengthy form-we had to describe why we wanted the role, what experience we had etc. Unsure why as I had already done this in my initial application form! Some of the questions in this form were unusual, and did not allow people to show themselves in the best light. E.g. Name three weaknesses? (one would be fair enough but three?!?! ) Name something that would affect your ability to do this role (I wouldn't have applied if I thought I couldn't do the role?)\r\nWe then moved on to do an independent proof reading task. This made more sense for the job role, proof reading a letter. We had half an hour to do this.\r\n\r\nIF we were successful at group interview, we'd then be invited to a second interview! (I wasn't)\r\n\r\nOverall, I found the interview to be very full on indeed! I felt that from the off we were under a great deal of time pressure, and by the end my hands were aching because we had to do so much writing! I thought filling in another application form was pointless, and I thought considering some of the ten of us had traveled far to be at the GROUP interview, we should have done more group work. \r\n\r\nIn every other PR role that I have applied for, they have been for higher salaries, and have involved a simple individual interview, with a press release writing task.
