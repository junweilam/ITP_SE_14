The presentation focused heavily on Motabilty's expectations. I felt they focused on their inflexible procedures for sickness, absence, lateness, shift patterns and parking far more than needed and left me feeling quite intimidated. \r\nWe were split into 3 groups. One had a tour and test of ability to use their computer system (I think it was called Alpha), the second did 2 group exercises (1. decide on who will be the next ambassador and 2.  Decide if someone should fail or pass their probation) the third was taken to do mock calls on the phone, using their system 'Ask Mo' to answer the scenarios that were presented.  \r\nThe day was ran very smoothly and was well organised. But I felt that it was a real 'show' and reading between the lines, not one person said how nice it was to work there, that they enjoyed it or really anything at all that made me want to work there. \r\nI was told they need to recruit 40 people before Nov as they have a real problem with people failing their probation. If I am honest it felt as though the assessment day is designed to make you fail. \r\nI didn't get the position (which I was relieved about). The feedback was that I didn't ask enough questions on the mock assessment. I believe this would be an unfair reason to not give someone a job as their 'Ask Mo' system did not prompt you with which questions to ask. And certainly, with maybe half a day of practice would be something an individual could work on or improve. It is an unrealistic to expect candidates to know exactly which questions to ask with no training or prior experience. I did resolve the clients issues in all 3 scenarios. \r\n\r\nThere was a feedback form at the end, which you are asked to put your name on. \r\nI think it would be incredibly difficult for a prospective employee to write honestly about their experience on the day for fear of it interfering with their chances of getting the position.  They asked everyone if they have any questions at the end. I did not feel that I could  ask the questions I wanted to because they weren't relevant to everyone. There was no actual interview other than a couple of questions over the phone right at the beginning as part of their screening. \r\nHonestly the worst interview process I have ever been through and wouldn't wish it upon anyone else, hence why I am writing this review. \r\nI felt like I was on a conveyor belt having scripted conversations. \r\nIf you want this job, prepare, make sure you know their policies and expectations and practice mock scenarios. \r\n\r\nMy comment to management: \r\nI can understand you want to set clear expectations from the start but I would suggest keeping the details of policies such as how many minutes you can be late and how many sick days you are 'allowed' per year are conversations to be had with employees who have performance issues and not to be had with prospective employees, especially when that potential employee is the most diligent, hard working, reliable and conscientious employee you will never have the pleasure of working with.", "Interview Questions": "A lady 's son had put diesel in a petrol car.
