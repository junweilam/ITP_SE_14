It's more like a chat discussing what you know about the company and why you're applying for the role. It was with one of the team leaders and they made the whole thing feel really positive and less scary than other telephone interviews I have had in the past. The interview went really well and I was invited to the group interview on the phone.\r\n\r\nDuring the group interview you listen to a short presentation about StepChange and they paused often to see if anyone had any questions. I would suggest asking one or two to show some interest in what they are saying. We then moved on to the awkward ice breakers so we all knew each others names etc... After that we had to do a group activity where you organise major worldwide events in order of significance. The point of the challenge is they are all important and its up to you as group to discuss what you all feel should go where. The whole time you are carrying out this activity you are being monitored by the team leaders but in no way did it feel uncomfortable or scary. The group then has to present their order of events back to the team leaders. We then had a maths test which was relatively easy and relevant to the job role, for example you would have to work out the surplus amount a person had after their wages have been spent and how much they can afford to pay off existing debt etc... you have a calculator and they provide really helpful formulas you can use to help you work it out. (Just to mention my group had 7 applicants including myself)\r\n\r\nA week later I was invited back for my one to one interview which involved competency based questions. Again this was with the team leaders, one asked the questions and the other wrote down my answers. They were your usual competency based questions and nothing that caught me off guard. I then had to do a role play telephone call with one of the team leaders. You are given six holiday recommendations and have about 10 - 15 mins to prepare. They then call through to you and you have to ask relevant questions during the call to whittle it down to one holiday recommendation that suits their needs. \r\n\r\nI am waiting to hear if I have gotten the job or not, fingers crossed!!!!", "Interview Questions": "Telephone interview: Tell me about you?"}, {"date": "22 May 2016", "title": "Data Verifier Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "N/A", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 days.\u00a0I interviewed at StepChange Debt Charity in May 2016", "Interview Descriptions": "I applied for said job and was offered a telephone interview.

Remember to wear a watch to this! Be seen to actively be time keeping. Remind the group when there is only five minute s remaining, as this will be a time exercise. Also bear in mind the point of the funding - in this case, it was to give back to the community. So I suggested the one which helped the most members of the community. I also suggested we rule out the ones we didn't want. Suggest you take votes and show of hands. Include people who haven't spoken.
