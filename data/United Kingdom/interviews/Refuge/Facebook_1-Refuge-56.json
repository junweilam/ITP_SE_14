No niceties, met with silence when attempted a basic 'nicety' of \"Nice to meet you all\". 10 min presentation on a pre-prepared topic with no questions from the interviewers. They then ping-ponged through mainly competency-based questions that they were asking all the candidates. I was asked \"What makes you the best candidate against the others\" which is a terrible question as we all know! Was allowed to ask 2 questions at the end, with only a few minutes to go before the end of the interview as their timings didn't allow for any time to reflect on my answers. As it was a 'one-and-done' interview, I asked if they had any reservations about my experience or answers that I could answer, to which I received a very hostile refusal to answer such a question. I knew there and then that I wasn't going to get the job! In this day and age, it's a very usual question! I received a generic 'unsuccessful' email a few days later offering feedback if I wanted it. It's been nearly 3 weeks and my request for feedback has been completely ignored.", "Interview Questions": "Do you currently manage a team?"}, {"date": "10 Oct 2022", "title": "Child Support Worker Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Neutral\nExperience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Refuge  in Oct 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "The 30 minute test is using Microsoft Word, and you need to send the file before the interview starts. \r\nAfter submitting the answer, the 30 to 60 minutes of interview is taken.", "Interview Questions": "Could you explain the different forms of domestic violence?"}, {"date": "22 Sept 2022", "title": "Refuge Worker Interview", "results": "Declined Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Refuge ", "Interview Descriptions": "Lovely panel, online interview, they asked ten questions after completing a test.
