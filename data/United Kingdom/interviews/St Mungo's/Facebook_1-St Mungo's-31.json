I came out of the interview thinking why I had even bothered.\r\n\r\nThe whole experience was weird and made me feel undervalued as a person. From start to finish the process and interview panel made me feel like I was just a number going through the motions of the rigid and robotic interview process.\r\n\r\nI definitely got the impression that St Mungos is one of those places that follows strict policy and procedure on paper to the detriment of any real human communication and interaction.\r\n\r\nIn my experience working for an organisation which places more importance on blindly following a dated and unhuman procedure over taking a more human, warm, and interactive process which would lead to more candidates feeling valued and respected is a big red flag.\r\n\r\nNot a great experience. After my experience and after reading about other people's experience, St Mungos don't seem to want open, free-thinking people working there.

Again, a clear indication that this is all just a process without any real care about the indivudals behind the application. \r\n\r\nOverall very bad experience which made me fell undervalued as a person, and made me feel like a sheep being herded through this outdated interview procedure where the goal is simply to assess you without really getting to know YOU.", "Interview Questions": "all competency based"}, {"date": "19 Jan 2020", "title": "Project Worker Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at St Mungo's", "Interview Descriptions": "I have applied for a few different positions at St Mungo's over the years (I have been with them twice, plus applied for secondments and once had to apply for my own during a restructure), and their interviews are usually pretty rigorous but also pretty good, in my experience they are always friendly and want to best out of you.

A numerical test, critical reasoning test, role play, admin test, and panel interview. I've done my fair bit of interviews but this many methods of testing only proves that they want someone from a very particular background. What is interesting is that they issue the psychometric test and say that 'it is neither the sole or deciding factor for your application' - so why do it? Now I'm not saying I don't love a good maths test and a critical reasoning exercise, but if it served no overall purpose other than to intimidate or knock the confidence off your applicants then I don't see the relevance in completing it. \r\nThe interview consisted of 6 questions, fairly easy and standard. \r\nI hadn't spent much time in their office but I couldn't see the diversity that they were championing.

(Read an advertisement and complete 16 true or false questions) \nInterview consisted of 3 parts\nInitially taken to a room and given a scenario (woman with bipolar disorder living at the project with an interest in attending art group. She recently admitted she no longer wants to attend the art group. Also has low self esteem, lacks confidence, and is isolated. \nI was asked to find out why she changed her mind about the art group. And how I can help her/what do I suggest I can help her with? \n( you are given 15 mins to prepare for this and can take your questions into the interview which is good) \n- role play: one of the panel acted as the woman: I asked her about why she no longer wanted to attend, and suggested I could go with her to the group to ease her into the group. Lasted 5 or so mins. After this I was asked whether there was anything else I wanted to ask, my reasoning for asking the questions I did. I said that I would also enquiry about her symptoms/whether she had been complying with her medication. \n- interview: 3 members of panel. All very friendly. Lasted 1h and 7 or 8 questions I believe. \n- assessment: read a short vignette e.g mine was about a 23 year old man with a history of violence who had recently been admitted for a psychotic episode. After reading this I had to complete a risk assessment form and basically say what risk factors I can identify from the vignette (easy) \n\nI've read a lot about how this job interview is very difficult but it genuinely wasn't that bad. Much less intimidating than I expected. So try not to overthink the many processes. The role play you are given plenty of time to prepare and can bring your answers into the interview with you.
