However, I couldn't help but notice subtle judgments exchanged through glances as I answered their competency-based questions. This created a highly uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the interview. Additionally, I was surprised to be presented with tasks that seemed unrelated to the administrative position I was interviewing for. These tasks included arranging 12 multiple priorities in order of importance and most bewildering of all, proofreading a literary text. The mismatch between the tasks and the position left me confused, as I had expected the focus to be on administrative skills rather than editing proficiency. \r\n\r\nDespite being informed that I would receive a response regarding the outcome of the interview by the end of the day, I never received a phone call or email. This experience was extremely disheartening and left me questioning my abilities. However, most importantly, it served as a revealing demonstration of the company's systemic cultural issues in how they interact with people. Undoubtedly, this ranks among the worst interview experiences I have encountered. In hindsight, I can't help but feel fortunate to have avoided a potentially detrimental situation.", "Interview Questions": "How would you handle a situation where you are faced with two priorities that require immediate attention simultaneously?"}, {"date": "24 Apr 2023", "title": "Ui\\Ux Designer Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Shelter (London, England) in Apr 2023", "Interview Descriptions": "Great interview process this was an amazing opportunity to present to the team!

The questions were relatively straight forward, in keeping with interviews for similar roles in other organisations and was a comfortable experience (overlooking the fact the interviewing director was dressed in his gym kit). I was informed that I would hear back early the following week (my interview was on a Thursday). I had heard nothing by late the following week, when I decided to email the recruitment team and ask for an update, the only response I got was 36 hours later when an automated email landed in my inbox inviting me to interview and to book my interview online. I thought this was strange as it was not in keeping with the personal emails I had received to date, but as a second stage of interviews had been mentioned as a possibility it wasn't completely out of the blue. I followed the link but wasn't offered any options for booking an interview slot. I tried to call the HR number and there was no answer, so I left a voicemail. I followed up with an email and confirmed some additional information requested in the invitation email. 30 minutes later I received another automated email informing me that I was not being offered the role and thanking me for my time, with no offering of feedback or the opportunity to ask for any. This automated rejection email was sent at 17:20 on a Friday evening, meaning I had no way of clarifying the situation until at least the Monday. I have sent a follow up email to clarify, that has again gone unanswered. I think if this is the way Shelter treat people who are applying to join their organisation, then I have had a lucky escape, as from my experience they do not value or appreciate people or the time they take to complete their recruitment processes. One of the worst recruitment processes I have experienced to date. A disgusting way to treat applicants, ironic considering the charities work is focused on helping and supporting vulnerable people.", "Interview Questions": "Tell us about your experience and what attracted you to this role at Shelter?"}, {"date": "14 Oct 2020", "title": "Part-time Assistant Shop Manager Interview", "results": "No Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Difficult Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at Shelter", "Interview Descriptions": "A long time after I applied, I was sent an invitation to interview (with a lot of notice which was good).
