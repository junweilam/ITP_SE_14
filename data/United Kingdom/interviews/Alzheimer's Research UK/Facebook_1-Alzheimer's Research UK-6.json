Also a short prioritisation task (written) that could have been sent ahead or done separately but was instead done mid-interview (we all just turned off our cameras). This was quite an awkward and clunky way to do it. After nearly three weeks I hadn\u2019t heard anything so I emailed the person who organised the interview to chase. She didn\u2019t reply but two days later I got a short, automated rejection email, to which I could not reply and which did not give any feedback.
