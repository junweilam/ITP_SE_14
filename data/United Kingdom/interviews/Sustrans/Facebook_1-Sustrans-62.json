I was in a room with one interviewer and the other called via Skype. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. I was unsuccessful and was informed of this through a telephone call three days later. They said I should have had a greater knowledge of Excel and shown a greater awareness of the role and company. However, I don't believe the interview gave me the opportunity to demonstrate the research I had conducted surrounding the company. They said I should also practice the STAR technique to structure my answers, which I had done so I found that pretty frustrating. However, they liked my answers around team work and focus groups.

The screening process was slow and I didn't hear that I'd been invited to interview for ~10 days, although I was informed of this delay.

It was a lot to do in 30 minutes and I messed up the Excel part a bit but the interviewers said that if I could explain what I should have differently that was fine. \r\n\r\nThe interviewers had sheets in front of them with a standard template of questions which they worked through. Most of these were the normal questions you would expect in an interview, however some of them seemed to be quite poorly worded and it was hard to know exactly what the interviewers were looking for. This was particularly true for the questions around teamwork, which I found quite confusing. \r\n\r\nIt was really helpful to have read some of Sustrans' reports, especially because some of the questions were about what makes a good report. They seemed pleased that I had read this material.\r\n\r\nIt took a week to hear back after my interview, which was longer than they had suggested and quite nerve-wracking. My feedback for the interview was that I hadn't demonstrated that I would be willing to consult line managers in situations where I was unsure of something.
