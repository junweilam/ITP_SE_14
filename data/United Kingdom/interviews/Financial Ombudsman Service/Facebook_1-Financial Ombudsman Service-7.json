The first step was an online situational judgement test, then a few days later I was invited to complete a daily task ordering exercise and a case study in which you have to write a View to either a business or customer. This depends on if you uphold or defend a complaint. I was invited to an interview a few days after this. The email stated they would send over details of what to expect in the interview a few days prior to the date chosen. I called up the resource line as I hadnt received this 2 days before the interview. The chap said he'd send it straight through to me, but he didnt. I received the info around 10am and the interview was a few hours later, so that wasnt great. The email gave 3 competency areas to focus on, and stated they would ask 1 question from each area, which they didnt. The interviewers (Luke and John) started by asking some basic organisational questions, which seemed to go very well. They followed up by going through the task ordering exercise and View that I\u2019d completed previously. The guys seemed more than happy with what Id done, and I felt strongly this was a good sign. They then asked several (more than 3) competency questions that Ive listed below. I used the star technique to answer. They didn\u2019t ask follow up questions or probe any of my answers really, which I new from previous experience is a bad sign that the answers weren\u2019t what they were looking for. Not everyone interviews well under pressure, and competency questions are never robust enough to show off a persons skills. If the Interviewers are not very good at leading someone to give them the information they\u2019re looking for with probing questions, they\u2019re not always going to get them, even when people are perfectly equipped to do the job. That\u2019s why a lot of work places in my experience have so many people get through interviews, but can\u2019t do the job they\u2019ve been hired to do. I felt that this was the case here. I could do the job in my sleep and Id enjoy it, but my first interview in 12 years, and I had no idea the sort of things they were looking for in my competency responses. In my feedback they explained the answers weren\u2019t strong enough, and although my experience was good, I didn\u2019t tick all their boxes with the competencies. Im sorry, I cannot give more help on that, as Im still not sure what they wanted.

(Pathetic!). Please read this review and previous reviews on interviews and the company itself before applying for this role.

If you pass this phone interview,  you will then be invited to a verbal reasoning test. If you pass that, then you will get a written excercise where you will have to write a response to a complaint. Now here's the catch.

Now I would understand how important the star technique is for interviews and I have used this in an effective manner in the past but to be told that you need to add certain things in your answers for these questions to actually answer these questions is ridiculous).

This was the SHL Verbal Reasoning test, where I needed to answer 30 questions in 19 minutes. \r\n\r\nAfter passing this, I had to book my 30-minute telephone interview within the next week. I had a lady from HR call me and the interview lasted about 17 minutes. She asked me general interview questions about myself and some competency questions. \r\n\r\nAfter passing this stage, I received an email to complete their online case study within 2 days. I was presented a case study about a customer asking for a refund for tickets from an organisation. The case study was about a page long. I had to then write a letter to the party who I will be deciding against and give reasons for my decision. I had another question, where I had to explain any reasons why I think that party will disagree with my reasoning. I structured my letter in two sections: 1) A brief overview of the complaint; and 2) My Decision, with the reasons why. To help with how to structure my answer, I researched the FOS website and found a page with decisions made by Investigators on various matters, so I tried to follow this structure. It helped me understand common things that Investigators must explain in their decision. \r\n\r\nAfter passing this stage, I was invited to the final interview. Due to Covid-19, it had to be conducted virtually over Webex. I was interviewed by a lady from HR and another Ombudsman Manager. The interview was an hour long and was split in 3 stages: 1) The Ombudsman Manager discussed my answer in the case study and how I came to that decision. He also tried changing little details from the case study to see if my answer will change. He grilled me very specifically about what method I used to reach the decision; 2) The second stage had strengths/ competency questions, and was the longest stage of the interview process. They concentrated on 3 main competencies and asked me questions relating to this. The lady from HR was very positive and friendly but the manager from Ombudsman grilled me intensely about my answers! His next questions would be based on what I said in the previous answer. He tried to grill me about my past job as a Paralegal and tried to challenge the legal knowledge I had explained in the situations for the competency questions, which I thought was highly irrelevant. I wasn't sure if he wanted me to provide answers that he thought were irrevocably right or if he was grilling me on purpose to see how well I handle myself when challenged, but regardless I explained myself well and stuck to my answers confidently. I'm not sure if I got unlucky with the interviewer I had, or if they are all like that, but I would come very prepared. 3) The final stage was where I could ask questions about the job, which I spent about 10 minutes questioning the role. \r\n\r\nI got rejected at the last stage of the application process which was extremely disappointing, especially as I thought the final interview had gone well and I had nailed it, regardless all that intense grilling. I was told that I would hear back within 48 hours and the rejection email was sent the day after my interview. I had wasted a month and a half going through their long recruitment process and was not even provided with feedback in the rejection email.
