The process involved 1:1 interview, group task, talking to a care experienced person (you have to lead the conversation and get nothing back) written assessment (writing an email about a care) and role play with an actor. They say they're not checking your knowledge of social work but your competencies and you can handle it but that's a lie. They expected to be a social worker with experience during this even though they say you can't have experience to get onto the training. If you haven't done lots of research and practiced, don't waste your time. I aced that interview and I was confident in everything I did. You can't show everything on camera and it shouldn't be on you to consider that but them when assessing.

The online portal is really easy to use and each stage of the application is very clearly laid out and the instructions are easy to follow. When booking onto the assessment centre you get a choice of about 3 days and either the morning or afternoon for each day which I thought was pretty good. The assessment day is online which I like because it means you don\u2019t have to travel \u2013 it isn\u2019t as easy to present yourself as you would in a face-to-face assessment day though (I hope they take this into account). For the assessment day you have 5 activities to complete. For each activity you get a brief before it starts so you are fully prepared going into it. The activities are an interview, group activity, written exercise, role play and conversation with a care experienced young person. I found the day to go quite quickly, but I did think it was laid out very well with plenty of time allocated for breaks or to have 5 minutes to just take a breather. Some of the activities were a lot harder than others. At points it felt as if they expect you to have this full catalogue of knowledge on how to be a social worker and to know exactly what to do and how to react in certain situations. This, for me, was really off-putting because it\u2019s meant to be a 2-year scheme where you learn how to respond to these types of situations and how to deal with certain people. I do think that they could \u2013 and should \u2013 take this into consideration as it has put me off entering this field of work and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who feels like this. Interview \u2013 35 minutes and interviewed by a qualified social worker. They were friendly and allowed you time to think about your answer. The questions were pretty standard but be prepared to be asked about a difficult situation you\u2019ve experienced. Group activity \u2013 30 minutes. Given 5 cases and 10 minutes to discuss as a group and say what you would do about them, followed by 2 minutes to discuss with the assessors. You then get some additional information and another 10 minutes to discuss as a group followed by another 2-minute discussion with the assessors. There needs to be more group discussion time as people can easily talk over others but make sure you do speak up! Written exercise \u2013 25 minutes for the whole task. You have to write a mock email response to a social work brief. Very clear and simple instructions and you get given a lot of background information. Keep an eye on the time as it goes very quickly \u2013 I would recommend starting a timer. Role play \u2013 15-minute brief followed by 20-minute activity. Very difficult. You take on the role of a newly qualified social worker having a meeting with someone played by an actor. This was a very challenging activity and you\u2019re thrown in at the deep end, and the actor gets very into their role and came across as harsh and rude. I appreciate that you do have to deal with people like this in this job but it was a lot for someone who was on an assessment day. I didn\u2019t feel as though the assessors were as sympathetic as they could be as they could clearly see I was out of my element. Conversation with a care experienced young person. You have a 5-minute conversation where you\u2019re completely in the lead. This is difficult as they don\u2019t give you anything at all and it gets pretty awkward. Then they ask you questions for 5 minutes about why you want to be a social worker and your motivation for applying. Overall, the assessment centre ran very smoothly and was laid out in a very good way but I do think that they need to take into consideration that the people applying are not social workers and may not have a lot of knowledge on how to deal with certain types of people or behaviours. I also feel that the assessors could have been a bit more emphatic, they didn\u2019t really offer any friendly smiles and came across a bit cold at times.", "Interview Questions": "Can you tell me about your background and what has led you to this career and why Frontline?"}, {"date": "9 Dec 2022", "title": "Grad Scheme Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I interviewed at Frontline", "Interview Descriptions": "5 state selection.

It was a very long process, 8:15 till about 1. Most of the activities finished early so you were sat at your laptop waiting for the next. I felt like the group task, everyone was just trying to talk over each other to get their point through.  At the end the day, I had to do a role play exercise with an actress pretending to be a family member and a social worker, now this was the worst experience of the day. They give you time to prep but nothing can prepare you for this, I had an actress that was literally acting as if she was in a Hollywood film, how they expect you to deal with someone who\u2019s literally shouting at you when you\u2019ve never been a social worker before, I have no clue. The actor talked over me, raised her voice, and obviously I understand that as a social worker you may encounter people like this, however this is an interview and I was unable to come across in a way that I wanted due to the way the actress was behaving.  It was honestly so overwhelming, I was almost in shock. I can\u2019t even imagine what it would have been like if it was in person so thank god it was virtual. Overall, it was a long and overwhelming day, they expect you to literally already be a social worker and therefore it\u2019s very difficult.", "Interview Questions": "This is a very vague view, in the group task, we had to prioritise cases with different options. Written exercise was an email if I remember correctly, a handover almost where you collated your information on a case and what steps you wanted to take next.
