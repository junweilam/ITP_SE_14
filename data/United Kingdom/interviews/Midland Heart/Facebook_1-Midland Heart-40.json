I had to book in a slot which I did and then attended an interview at their head office in Birmingham a week later. I signed in at reception, waited for a while and as I was earlier than expected I was taken through to their busy office on the ground floor where people were chatting away amongst themselves and some of the women looked like they had lost the will to live. I was then given a few pieces of paper, a calculator and a scenario which I had 20 minutes to complete with all that noise going on around me.  Once completed I was taken upstairs for an interview where 2 people interviewed me, they asked me many questions and as I have worked in this field before I was able to give real examples and had some knowledge of what they do which seemed to have impressed them a little judging by the looks on their faces. I was then asked all the usual cliche questions that you get asked in interviews followed by an opportunity to ask some of my own questions, the bombshell was then dropped on me that its actually a part time role of 20 hours per week which to be totally honest is nowhere near enough hours to live and its cover for maternity until November 2018. What sickened me the most is that about roughly 7 people have had an interview for the one job which wasn't told to me until I got to the interview, the bloke from HR should have told me this and I wouldn't have bothered turning up. I gave a very good interview and its shocking that I didn't get the job but then again when there is only one job going its clear which ethnicity usually gets it.", "Interview Questions": "Give an example where you had to work under pressure"}, {"date": "25 Apr 2018", "title": "Resourcing Advisor Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 2 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Midland Heart (Birmingham, England) in Oct 2017", "Interview Descriptions": "Around 1.5 hours long process consisting of 3 elements; role play scenario, preparing and presenting information based on the role play and finally a panel interview. \r\n\r\nIt was clear that the initial activity was designed to test key skills and behaviours for the role.

This was not a competence based interview in my view.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely no concern whatsoever for people who may have had childcare, caring or travel commitments, keeping candidates there for two hours whilst they endlessly chatted.

One of the panel discussed mainly his own issues which had nothing to do with why I was at interview. I also did not feel that he valued or could adjust to, a culture of flexible working, which I stated was important for me. I got the feel that diversity was paid lip service to and they were uncomfortable at questions I asked regarding the diversity mix within the team.\r\n\r\nI was told that feedback would be given the following week.
