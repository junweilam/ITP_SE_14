From the first informal meeting, it took over 3 weeks to be invited to an assessment day. The assessment day really didn't allow candidates to showcase their skills as it was very rushed and seemed unorganised. The moment we arrived no-one seemed to know the log-in details for the WIFI, which was necessary for us to undertake the assessment. Took over 15 mins for someone to find out what they were. Was offered a positon but not at a salary anywhere near what I'm currently on. Also seemed like they use the advertised position to get lots of candidates in and then offer them lower salaries and positions.

One with 2 x managers and one with 2 x senior leaders. Was fairly straightforward with quite basic questions. Made to feel relaxed throughout both interviews. The banding for this role was advertised between \u00a325k-\u00a335 with potential up to \u00a340k. When offered the job, it was to my horror, despite disclosing my salary expectations that HR offered me \u00a330k. I have to be honest, I was prepared to take a step back in my career and I would be doubtful there was any more experienced candidates than myself. I was then offered \u00a332k which was still less than my current salary. All in all, a shocking experience.
