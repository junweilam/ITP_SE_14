The recruiter was in touch a lot seeing I was ok for the interview and making sure everything would go smoothly. \n\nThe interview was a 2 person panel they seemed friendly enough and I answered the questions to my best ability and thought I gave an ok enough interview - so am not sure quite what they were looking for. \n\nAnyway one week later NO response. Its usually quite quick if a recruiter is involved...by now it had been 2 weeks and I'm thinking well I probably definitely haven't got the job but nevertheless its courtesy to respond back to the interviewee so I phoned the recruiter and emailed - no response. I emailed and called again a few days later - no response. By now I was seething as it showed a complete lack of respect towards me with Reed just ghosting me. So I thought I may as well contact the company directly  as I had the interviewers details on the Teams invite and explained that I had not heard back from the recruiter and if they could help at all. \n\nCue the next morning 2 missed calls from the recruiter and an email saying I had been unsuccessful and if I wanted feedback etc etc. \n\nI have had such a negative experience and it was all because of the recruiter putting the company in a bad light - however its their call if they want to use a recruiter who doesn't get back to candidates and then ignores them.", "Interview Questions": "Name 2 strengths and 2 weaknesses "}, {"date": "31 Mar 2023", "title": "Coordinator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0I interviewed at One Housing (London, England) in Aug 2021", "Interview Descriptions": "After a brief application, the interview was with two managers.

Whole process took about a month after the deadline closed.\r\n\r\nOnline psychometric test was a timed task- started with two touch typing tasks, then a mix of maths, english and visual patterns lasting about 50 minutes in total. Heard back the following week to attend assessment day at their HQ in London.\r\n\r\nThe assessment day was from 11.30am- 4pm; there was only 4 candidates being interviewed and only one position in pre-construction management available. There was five tasks during the day and a short lunch where you could meet previous graduates and management.\r\n\r\nThe first task was a group task to build the tallest possible structure out of provided materials (paper, sellotape, marshmallows, sticks etc.) to a budget. This was focusing on how you work in a team and solve a problem; each candidate had a member of management watching how they interacted so try and contribute during this and assist others, they are looking for team players not so much leaders!\r\n\r\nThere was 1-1 interviews with management, very basic questions asked including why this company? why this scheme? biggest achievement? biggest disappointment? where do you want to be in 5 years? what can you tell us about yourself we can't get from your CV?\r\n\r\nThere was two data analysis tasks we were rotated around- one was to analyse company reports and suggest improvements; the other was mock emails you had to prioritise the tasks and halfway through you were given more to re-prioristise- a mixture of tasks including calculating costs, analysing technical drawings for mistakes and customer complaints.\r\n\r\nThere was also a negotiation task with a manager, who goes very method as a building contractor.. so be prepared.. to negotiate on behalf of the company an over-run build. The focus is on lowering the cost and keeping to an agreed time frame, so researching average build costs and schedules would help with this.\r\n\r\nOverall its an enjoyable process, management is really friendly and encouraging, making it a relaxed atmosphere. It is very competitive and being prepared with knowledge of the company is essential.
