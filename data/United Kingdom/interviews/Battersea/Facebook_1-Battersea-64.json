I would like my review to reflect the organisation rather than specific interviewers hence I have amalgamated into one review and also omitted some identifying details. Both experiences were extremely positive - the earllier process seemless despite being only a week or two into Covid; and in the earlier interview I reached the final two candidates but was unsuccessful. Follow up and feedback was prompt, thorough and positive and in fact I kept in professional contact with the lead interviewer. Second role interview equally positive, very well arranged and follow up prompt and I was offered employment.  Really like the new online portal. Only downside is having to enter a lot of information in different fields which could be served better by attaching a CV - a bit of a faff when applying for lots of jobs, and indeed multiple roles with the one employer. Also made aware that shortlisting appeared to be blinded (well done Battersea). Just a great experience both times and the organisation seems to be trying hard to run a quality process.
