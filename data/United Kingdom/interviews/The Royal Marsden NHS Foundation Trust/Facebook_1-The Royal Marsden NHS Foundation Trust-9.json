I have attended lots of NHS interviews, which normally last 20-45 mins. This was over within 10-15. I felt like they already had a candidate lined up. After my interview I was told I would hear back by the end of the week. They did not get back to me by the end of the week, so I waited for Monday. Still no word from them, so I decided to chase them up via email. Two days later, they still hadn't responded to my email. I then called for an update to be told I need to email them (even though I already did that.) Anyway, I emailed again, and they finally told me I hadn't been successful. I studied for about 2 weeks for this interview, and I really wanted the job. In hindsight, I am glad I didn't get the job as the lack of professionalism in them getting back to me is quite telling of their character.  They also would not supply any feedback which I think is unfair, and hinders us job seekers. Overall did not enjoy the interview process and would not apply again in the future.", "Interview Questions": "Why the Royal Marsden?\nWhere do you think you will struggle?\n"}, {"date": "11 Jun 2021", "title": "Clinical Trials Administrator Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Average Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust", "Interview Descriptions": "Very smooth process.
