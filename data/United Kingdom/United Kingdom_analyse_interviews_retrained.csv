Group interview observed whilst interacting with others in a group activity task which was relatively easy. However trying to communicate and voice my opinions was not easy as people tried to get a word in. Just be confident and be lengthy with your opinions.

While the staff I spoke to were all really friendly and obviously knowledgeable the HR process left a lot to be desired. It was more than a month between submitting the application and getting an interview offer  I'd assumed I hadn't gotten an interview and then I heard. Then multiple weeks between the first and second interviews multiple weeks before I heard a final decision. It's been more than a month and despite requesting feedback multiple times I've only had unofficial feedback from an HR colleague whose expertise isn't in comms making the feedback not incredibly useful.,0.9970618,0.002703334,0.00023490904

After having applied online I was shortlisted for an inperson interview with three people at ActionAid London. I was told that I would first have to take a one hour test then have the one hour panel interview. Upon arrival I was led straight into the panel interview room and the interview started right away instead of the test which was very confusing. One of the panel members was really nice and friendly the others looked bored and it almost seemed like they had already chosen the candidate (I was the last interview). The questions were straight forward related to my experience for the role why ActionAid etc.  The test was more difficult than the panel interview. In only one hour there was an excel test to complete (budget report) and a word test (proposal to amend). I was told that I would hear from them three days after the interview. On said date nothing. After reaching out I was told that it would actually be another couple of days for them to be able to let me know their decision. Still nothing  I had to wait another two weeks to receive an automatic reply from HR.  Not a very feminist organisation :),0.98429674,0.015298697,0.00040461094

Was never contacted about the income despite interviewing for a senior role.  Assumed I didn't get the job but was surprised to not be formally told. This is particularly bad as I had previously been a volunteer campaigner for ActionAid.

2 of 3 interviewers were unpleasant and created an uncomfortable atmosphere during the interview. One made the odd unpleasant comment whilst the other smirked. The line manager didn’t appear to be a great listener and the whole experienced comfirmed what I had read on glassdoor in advance of the interview. Didn’t get back to me within agreed time and had to be chased. All around a negative experience,0.9983784,0.0014759324,0.0001457183

Forms are easy to fill in and not laborious.,0.00047681766,0.0014553056,0.9980679
One interviewer was reasonably friendly and the other came across as stand offish and rude. I felt I did quite well in the interview but I was not offered the job and never given a reason. I think it was because I don’t have a car which is a bit ironic considering the first question was “what does equality and diversity mean to you?” and a car is not necessary for the job. I told them about my degrees and research work and they said “you will find this job boring” I assured them that I didn’t mind at all and still wanted the job. When I asked how I did one of the interviewers said “we’re looking for someone friendly” and I felt like they were implying that I don’t fit that description. I just got a strange overall vibe from the interview and like they didn’t want me there the second I opened my mouth. During the interview they kept skipping questions by saying “you’ve just basically answered that one” which I took as a sign that I did well but really I felt I wasn’t being given the opportunity to answer them all thoroughly. If each question was scored I would have been losing out on a lot of points. Another problem was that they gave me a specific date and time which was not negotiable.,0.95347065,0.046130024,0.00039930016

Applied online and heard back swiftly.  Process: Test and Interview. Test consisted of preparing presentation and presenting. Panel of four on  interview. 12 interview questions. Interviewers distracted throughout which was very offputting and rude. Service user on panel did not ask any questions. Questions essential to job were not asked. Not warned beforehand that 'test' would be a presentation. Did not inform me of decision when they said they would.

Interview at Newton Abbot Devon. Fairly easy questions...except four questions into the interview the interviewer asks me my age. As I give my answer he says he has to end the interview there as i'm not of of the right age for them to insure me to drive their vehicles. How this wasn't screened out in their selection process is beyond me showing a complete lacklustre effort in their interviewing shortlisting.  A total waste of time and money (45 mile round trip!).

"I was contacted by Age UK HR who were friendly. It took about 2 weeks to have the first stage interview. It consisted of an interview with a finance person called Bruce and a HR lady. They were very friendly and I built strong rapport with them. They asked reasonable questions such as experience relating to systems reporting why the role why Age UK etc. I did well because I had done over 6 hours of interview preparations knowing their annual report and charity inside out.  The 2nd stage interview was the following week with the CFO Rajeev. When I first entered he was late and wasn't prepared for the interview since it was clear that he read the CV for the first time. He didn't introduce himself nor the charity nor the role but instead went directly to the first question in a rude and sharp tone ""why are you here?"". Obviously I didn't get any chance to build rapport or have flow from the interview because of that. It seemed to be purposefully designed to catch me off guard and disturb me and ruined the rest of my interview since it made me forget much of the preparations I did and made me nervous.  He asked similar questions to the first stage interview but when I was speaking he cut me off many times and moved on to the next question. This was very rude and didn't let me finish my answers. When I was speaking he kept saying that we're running out of time and he has to see another candidate. The interview lasted 30 mins which was not enough for this stage and made the interview very rushed from the side of the interviewer. I've never had an interview like this it was very unprofessional. I'm happy that I didn't get an offer. They replied about 6 days after the interview with an email mentioning that I didn't receive an offer. They gave no feedback nor call.",0.9911969,0.008345806,0.00045737723

The interview involved a 10 minute presentation the task was given beforehand. However this task was only given late on Thursday and the interview was the following Monday allowing 3 days to prepare. The rest consisted of 5 competency based questions. There was no warning of this interview style prior which requires significant preparation. The competency questions were lengthy and communicated in a complex way. They were incredibly specific (not as generalisable as other competencybased questions which enable you to tailor them to your own experiences). Questions didn't apply to my CV neither was there any flexibility to adapt. A very corporate structure which allowed for no individuality.

Was invited for interview and had the interview over zoom two days later. Was still waiting for the invite link up until 5 minutes before. Was asked a few irrelevant questions   which had nothing to do with the role I applied for. One of the questions they asked was how much experince I had with HR systems in which the position I applied for was not a HR role and even the people who interviewed me said I would not be doing anything HR as they have a HR department. When I answered to the best of my ability I could tell by their faces they weren't really acknowledging the fact they asked me a stupid question. Interviewed by two people who wrote down eveything I said. Very robotic no smiles just strict. Was told I would receive feedback which I did not receive anything just a generic email to say I had not been successful and since I did not have an interview they cannot offer individual feedback. I did have an interview. I tried to prepare for this interview but they give you no information about the interview or what it entails.

The worst interviewing techniques I've ever encountered no engagement whatsoever  as the panel of two were writing everything I said down as said it.  I had to do a presentation and neither of them even looked at me because they were busy writing totally unprofessional and unwelcoming interview.  I asked what a typical day in the job consists of and it was the only time I'd seen their faces! It was  totally weird answering questions to the top of heads and waiting minutes in between each question while they finished their scribbling I started to feel guilty about the amount of writing they were doing and started to give shorter answers.

The job was advertised as a Northern Ireland role. When I was invited to interview the interviews were being held in Manchester and I had to fly to England at my own cost. This was not made clear in the job advertisement.  Due to the timing of flights I had to leave Northern Ireland at 4am in order to attend for interview and was therefore exhausted.  I was asked to design and present a presentation on a training course that I could design and deliver.  I thought my presentation went very well.  There were two members on the panel (though there had been three members of the panel for the previous applicant  so no consistency there!)  One of the interviewers was pleasant and engaging whilst the other looked like she did not want to be there at all.  I had some example training activities to show group participation.  The first interviewer enthusiastically took part whilst the other sat silently refusing to take part.   After the presentation an hour of interview questions followed.  The panel had a list of 20 or so questions and were debating in front of me which ones to ask me. They changed their mind a few times.  There was obviously no consistency in the questions that different applicants were being asked.   The questions were the most difficult I have ever been asked but I had prepared well and felt I gave excellent answers.  I have performed badly in other interviews but know that I answered well for these questions.   In the end they did not offer the job to anyone and I asked for feedback.  The disengaged member of the panel phoned me to give feedback on my presentation and it was at this point that I was sure she hadn't listened to anything I had said.  The feedback was not representative of my presentation but I didn't bother to say anything as i realised that this would not be a good team to work for anyway.,0.9964354,0.0033465868,0.00021792704

I was interviewed by two senior employees. One from the Marketing team and another from the Policy and Campaigns team. It was fairly informal very friendly and chatty. Beforehand I completed a test which was around 45 minutes long where I wrote copy for an email to supporters and a draft campaign comms plan. The spoken half of the interview was around 1 hour. Questions were mainly around my experiences and skills mentioned in my application. I was also asked about the political landscape examples of campaigns I liked others I didn't. How I would analyse and evaluate campaigns. Both employees wrote lots of notes during the interview. I was contacted the following day with an offer. I accepted.,0.00058197306,0.9974929,0.0019251892
The interview was with a two people panel preceded by a 45 minutes written test. Questions were the typical HR prepared question  which don't always have a direct relation to the position.

Application sent to volunteer coordinator who then forwarded on my details to the Research Network Engagement Officer who reviewed my application. The Engagement Officer then emailed me a questionnaire for me to fill out and send back. this was very brief and asked only a few questions on my experience and knowledge of the role. Once this had been sent back to the Officer my details were then passed on to the Research Network Volunteer Area Manager in Northern Ireland who contacted me with a few brief notes as to what the role would entail.  Overall the process was very brief and was more just to ensure my experience matched the job role.,0.0012249019,0.9985347,0.00024040745
I applied online and was offered an interview a week later.  I was asked to prepare a Micro Teaching Session on any subject lasting no more than 10 mins and this was to be based on Kolbs Learning Cycle.  I was also informed there would be a second presentation and I would receive this on the day.  When I arrived I was invited into a quiet room and the interview process was explained to me.  I was provided with a case study and provided flip chart paper to present to the panel.  This was a case study and 4 questions needed to be answered.  I was invited into the interview room 20 mins later and was introduced to the panel. I was made to feel very much at ease . I presented my micro session my case study findings on flipchart and I was asked 8 questions.  The panel of 3 interacted well with my micro session (Just as well as I needed their participation).  Overall I found it to be a positive experience made to feel so welcome good interaction with the panel and they made me feel relaxed and that they had a genuine interest in my skills values and experiences.,0.0006108884,0.028129224,0.97125995
Panel interview including delivering micro training session prepared in advance and presentation prepared from information given just before the interview. The wall between the waiting area and the interview room was very thin so I could hear the previous candidate being interviewed.

Long test before the interview started.  Manager and another interviewed me and I did not get a good vibe from them.

There was a skills assessment prior to the interview that lasted about an hour. This was a written assessment. There followed a Panel interview with the Head of HR Operations a regional business operations person and a legal/ER person which commenced with a presentation that I had prepared for at home. The topic was what they could expect me to deliver within the first 12 months.  The room was far too small to be able to present adequately and I felt like I was talking to the wall.  The panel asked questions in turn about 15 in all and then I had the opportunity to ask questions some of which the Head of HR Ops struggled to answer.

The interview process revolved around the individuals personality thinking on their feet and general presence. The interview was conducted in groups of three around a table with the manager. The manager explained the job and the importance of the role we were applying for.  My impression of the whole interview process is that the manager did not expect to be overly impressed by the knowledge the applicants had of Amnesty International. Instead he was more interested in whether or not we were not introverts and uncomfortable. Basic competence testing was evident but by no means was the most important factor in determining who would get the job.,0.93435425,0.065322556,0.00032323273

Telephone Interview. Interviewers clearly using a scoresheet or similar method to judge replies to questions. No discussion at all. Questions are asked and you live and die by the exact answer you happen to give. Very poor.  Combine this interview experience with the fact that everything is done via an automated recruitment system (i.e. the first time you speak to somebody about one of their roles will be the interview itself) and the whole recruitment process at Amnesty seems to be geared specifically to make the organisation appear as soulless as possible which is ironic given the nature of Amnesty's stated aims.

 Standard online application but with two bespoke questions to role.  Preinterview written test  Interview by Skype (poor connection) with a panel of 4x senior executives from across world  Probably the poorest recruitment experience I've ever had.  A prearranged written test I was booked in for was cancelled twice at very short notice after I had arranged to be available (cancellation email came through 20 mins after the test was supposed to start).  The Skype interview was awful with constant drop outs reconnections and misunderstandings in communication.  I did not hear back for weeks and then eventually got a standard rejection email inviting me to ask for feedback. I asked for feedback and never heard from them again.  In between applying and getting an interview I developed some apprehensions based on Glassdoor reviews and some Googling mostly about poor management internal bureaucracy and wasted resources.

However it was until the end of the interview that I got an overview and greater understanding of the position.  It took a further 3 weeks for them to tell that I have been unsuccessful for the role and they will not provide feedback due to volume of applicants.

Lady was nice and said she wanted to progress my role. Sadly the HR department would not progress it.

Appalling frustrating and chaotic. I applied online and recieved an email asking me to go to their website to select an interview slot. When I went to the site it required me to fill in a number of additional forms before allowing me to proceed to select a slot (not a big deal but would have been good to mention). When I got to the select a slot part of the site there were no interview times uploaded.  I emailed to tell them that there were no slots for me to select from. About 10 days passed before I recieved a reply saying that the interview panel were not available on alternative days to those listed and therefore they would not be proceeding with my application. Awful recruitment process. Don't waste your time.,0.9980724,0.0017918197,0.00013579104
90 min process. I was given a set of questions to go over for 30 mins and prepare my answers. Followed by a 5 min presentation delivered by me and then 55 mins asking the questions I was presented with. The panel entered the room and sat opposite me in silence. They made me feel awkward the moment they walked in which prompted me to introduce myself. During my presentation I was met with a series of awkward glances and expressions which i felt was off putting. It so happened that she was to ask questions which even after I had answered she seemed to want me to answer differently as if my previous answer was utter nonsense! The interview over ran and we had to move into another room. Needless to say I received an email 4 days later to say I was unsuccessful. After emailing them to ask for feedback I was met with no response. It was confidence crushing for the following reasons: 1. This would have been the 3rd time I interviewed with Barnardo's. 2. My previous interview for Portfolio Manager was met with fantastic feedback and I felt the panel for that interview made me feel so comfortable where I was able to deliver. 3. During every question my responses were met with interruption and expressions like they had bitten into a lemon. I have no interest in applying here again.,0.99631065,0.003484701,0.00020460712

The recruitment process is certainly not with the times. You have to fill out a word document form that could take several hours to complete.

In tray test  pretty standard to test your priority skills. Although left to do it in staff kitchen and was told I wouldn't be disturbed as there was a sign in the door. Interrupted twice by staff. Kept waiting for about 3045 mins for panel interview. Chilly corridor. Discussed reasons for priority setting for in tray test. No issues.  Questions from panel of 3 were tough. Only 1 of them attempted to put me at ease. Most questions related to legislative stuff around safeguarding which is understandable. They didn't ask anything about Barnardos as an organisation which they had suggested you read up on for the interview in their invitation details.  Looking back the job description was very vague and it was clear they wanted someone who was very experienced and knew the job already rather than someone with less experience who could grow with it.  It felt very cold/bland no attempt to find out about me as a person or previous experience could bring to the role.  Disappointed.,0.9925303,0.007298316,0.00017148186
I met at the service with the Manager and another member of staff. We began the interview then they realised I was not the applicant they thought so had to go outside and return when the other applicant had finished.   The interview was okay the panel were quite abrupt and one of them rolled her eyes when I spoke about the work I had done with vulnerable people which was very unprofessional. I knew by the atmosphere and their responses that I hadn't got the job. The job description stated administration experience wasn't essential but it was clear they were looking for someone who was experienced.   I applied online and heard back from the company around a week after the closing date. I was given 10 days to prepare for the interview.,0.9789874,0.020840554,0.00017204224

The questions reflected the job description. The job description did not reflect the job. The job description was generic with a customised blurb. The blurb was poorly thought through.

Standard Application form and personal statement. About a week after the closing date I got invited to interview. I thought the interview process was good giving candidates an opportunity to show their abilities through different methods  there was a presentation a written case study task and an interview. It meant that if you are not great at one aspect there are other opportunities to shine. All took place in one session which lasted about 90 minutes.   The panel were friendly and supportive and helped me feel at ease. I felt like they wanted to see my best side and help me relax.

This relates to two interviews one in 2020 and one in 2022. I would like my review to reflect the organisation rather than specific interviewers hence I have amalgamated into one review and also omitted some identifying details. Both experiences were extremely positive  the earllier process seemless despite being only a week or two into Covid; and in the earlier interview I reached the final two candidates but was unsuccessful. Follow up and feedback was prompt thorough and positive and in fact I kept in professional contact with the lead interviewer. Second role interview equally positive very well arranged and follow up prompt and I was offered employment.  Really like the new online portal. Only downside is having to enter a lot of information in different fields which could be served better by attaching a CV  a bit of a faff when applying for lots of jobs and indeed multiple roles with the one employer. Also made aware that shortlisting appeared to be blinded (well done Battersea). Just a great experience both times and the organisation seems to be trying hard to run a quality process.  ,0.010932631,0.96903896,0.020028342
Two rounds with the first being a question answer and with second round being a presentation with more questions. Both rounds were quite rigid with the people just asking questions that were prepared before rather than a conversation about the role. Disappointing that after spending hours preparing for both interviews and having the interviews with the same people and getting to know them the rejection was an automated hr email which offered feedback upon request but they don’t reply to you even if you ask for it.,0.9987458,0.0011101201,0.00014408406
I had a first interview which was carried out on Zoom.

Before any calls or face to face interviews the 1st stage involved a task which took 1 hour and 20 minutes. I was happy to complete this even with very little notice. I received an email asking for the task to be completed within a few days or I could attend the office and complete it the next day. I was told I would hear back by the Thursday with feedback. Almost 2 weeks later I still haven't. Considering this was a HR role I would have expected a better process. Before any interviews or telephone calls to ask for candidates to complete a lengthy task I think was a lot as it basically just was saving them time interviewing and then to not hear any feedback back even after I have chased on it is unprofessional and a very bad way of interviewing. It felt like it was a waste of my time.  I would have expected a lot more from a HR role and I have yet to speak to anyone on the phone about any of these stages.

Poorly organised and insulting process from the initial contact. I applied at the start of April to be  contacted about the role 3 weeks later.

The first time slot given was for same day the email was sent  2 hours later!  I agreed to complete the test that evening but the HR contact sent the email through 45 minutes late. I was invited to a first stage interview a week and a half later with two HRBPs. They seemed inexperienced in Recruitment and took turns to fire questions at me from a printed list. There was no attempt at small talk or natural flow during the conversation it all felt very awkward. At one point one of the interviewers asked me detailed questions about my HR qualification and how I was assessed making a comment about 'how times have changed' as if to undermine my hard work and insinuate I had an easy pass.  Also worth noting  they didn't check availability with me at all just told me the time I would be interviewing over email 'Your interview will be held at XX time on XX date'. Very inconsiderate.

Brief assessment with interview (about 45 minutes). Very formal process the recruiters came from the HQ in London. It wasn't unpleasant and I received positive feedback at the end. Unfortunately for me someone had more experience and got the job. Regardless just try and stay cool. As long as you try and research the kinds of answers to give beforehand you will be alright.  Also note the skills and behaviour questions aren't exactly the same as what you are being asked. They are similar but you would have to adjust your answers accordingly.,0.0008437064,0.99830997,0.00084630935
It was laid out in a form of an assessment center.  British Council representative had emailed out a few days prior some scenarios and asked to prepare a preliminary lesson plan.

Applied online and was contacted within a month for a brief 30 minute telephone interview. Then 2 weeks after that was invited to complete the IELTS. 3 weeks after offered an interview.

When I had arrived was told that they had been trying to get hold of me (but was now in Nigeria as opposed to the UK so my mobile wouldn't have worked) they had explained that something had come up and they could interview within the next 2 hours. Interview took about 1hr 30. Had to do a 10 minutes presentation based on 60 day proposal and answered many questions about it then answered mainly behavioural type questions.

I was interviewed by three people (potential Manager someone currently in the role and a member of HR).

The most appalling and unprofessional interview I have every attended.  The hiring managers were rude and abrupt as they had already promised the job to one of the BC sheep. Their body language was stiff and fake at the end of the interview they both refused to shake my hand until I had put mine out to shake. The manager promised to call me regarding the outcome. However the panel did not contact me. I had to wait a further 2.5 weeks to get a generic email from HR in London who don't know what day is.,0.99901116,0.00083152886,0.00015735984
Having applied online I was invited for interview. I was asked to bring a piece of work with me that I had written to be discussed during the interview. As this was for a content writer role I assumed they would read this piece of work in place of an editorial test. They did not. I was surprised that there was no editorial or practical element to the interview process whatsoever.   In the interview they glanced at the work and just asked me a couple of questions about it.  All their questions seemed to be a box ticking exercise they weren't looking for a candidate who was actually a good content writer but one who was able to shoehorn whatever experience they had done into answers to their formulaic managementspeak questions. When I was told by email that I hadn't got the job I asked for feedback and was sent an unnecessarily harsh email by the interviewer explaining how much worse I was than the successful candidate and how I didn't seem to know anything about the company which was completely untrue. They seemed to have mistaken my nervousness for lack of research. Certainly a learning experience.  I am astounded that for an editorial / content role they didn't want to test how well the candidates could write. In my opinion this is the main thing they should have been interested in for this role.,0.99629885,0.0035195039,0.00018169548

Animal research  and ghosted twice when I asked  for feedback.  I found it misleading that there was no mention of animal testing in the detailed job pack. The interviewer mentioned it as a footnote right at the end of my first interview.   In my second interview they couldn’t answer any of my questions about their animal research. I had to ask the recruitment team who sent me a leaflet which I’d already read before the interview.   This inability to answer my simple questions was a red flag for me.   Two interviews. First involved presentation and competency questions. The second was a panel interview. This was more relaxed and they repeated questions they asked in the first.

I applied for a Sales Assistant position at British Heart Foundation through Indeed.co.uk. A few weeks later I received a call from one of the store's managers for the first interview TBH I was not told beforehand that they'll be calling to interview so I was caught off guard but the manager I spoke to was really friendly and nice.  He went through the job description the hours I would be working if hired and what is expected of me as an employee. He explained that sales assistants are like second managers in the store and that I would be expected to run the shop on the weekends.  He only asked a few questions so you do not really need to prepare or panic about the first interview.  After the interview he said I would hear back from them in a week for a second interview with another manager.

Still awaiting feedback but my expectation is low.  Great organisation lovely offices great benefits but sadly my experience upon rejection is probably the reason they need change in Recruitment/HR.  Disappointing to have the head nods in interview when asked about giving candidates a good experience whatever the outcome but it's not something that is actually lived through their values.  My feedback would be: Have candidates meet the manager first don't waste candidates time. When you meet candidates face to face have the respect for them to pick up the phone with the outcome of the interview. If you offer feedback from the interviewers please provide it rather than just not reply.,0.9926191,0.006401066,0.0009799227
The interview was in the shop where I am currently working for 35 minutes. The interview was with the Shop Manager.  The questions were simple direct and the regular you can practice in advance. Good atmosphere and you feel relax and comfortable.,0.00023247562,0.00057709694,0.9991904
I had gone online to learn that there was a paid Saturday sales assistant in the same shop I had been volunteering at for roughly 4 and a half years. I managed to get as far as an interview with the area manager and told to wait roughly half a week to hear back which I thought was a pretty good turn around time compared to some other companies. I had come to realise that I was up against not much competition at all for getting the job.  I then got feedback from the area manager saying that my experience in general which was shown through the interview questions that I was asked along with the fact of security aspects of things for being in charge at such an age of 20 years old would not be worth the risk of letting me get the job. Yet they decided to employ someone who was external to the company over someone aka myself who has had years worth of experience first hand as a volunteer. The system of promotion to staff internally within to be able to work their way up the ranks from volunteer to certain levels of manager are not worth trying no matter how much experience internally you have had with the charity.  Staffing issues seem to be an issue more and more so as time goes on in the shop I volunteered in for numerous years but is not helped by the staffing not being there that would prevent the whole security issue being there in the first place. It is one big horrible circle to go through as the reasons of staffing and security all lead back to each other in one big mess. Not only to mention of how do you expect a 20 year old to have experience in any kind of management role at all of any kind. The so called training on the job is meant to be what that covers which would include aspects such as paperwork and cashing up for example. I have all the customers service experience and stock sorting and replenishment skills so why let security due to poor staffing issues and what seems to be lack of willingness to be trained on the job let someone down.,0.99707675,0.002653798,0.00026946422
I turned up for an interview as a Sales Assistant. The manager took me into his office and claimed the lightbulb was broken so he had to interview me in the dark. He hadn’t bothered to read my CV. The then proceeded to tell me that the job I had applied for wasn’t actually the job he was interviewing for. He was instead interviewing for someone to work on the telephone booking collections in their “call centre”. He said he didn’t have a job description for this role. Would I like to continue? Alarm bells were ringing at this point. Several things occurred to me.  A. The position had already been filled B. He already had someone else in mind and was hoping his ploys would put me off C. He was terribly disorganised and I should give him the benefit of the doubt D. My face didn’t fit from the get go He then proceeded to tell me he didn’t have any prepared questions for the role he was interviewing for. He asked a few questions in a disinterested manor. Showed me around and then dismissed me.,0.99782085,0.0020356618,0.00014344342

2 round interview process. First interview in person was required to bring a presentation on a USB which the interviewers were unable to use. Didn't plan enough time to do the presentation and ask all the questions so they left a lot of the questions out.  Got through to 2nd round which was a Skype interview. Less than 24hours notice and was told I was one of the final 2 candidates. Line manager never phoned or even emailed to tell me the outcome and ignored when I emailed him. Eventually heard from HR  an email template. Feedback when I finally got it was vague and HR didn't respond to my questions.,0.9988154,0.0010511244,0.00013348123
Applied online via the BHF website. 3 or 4 days after the closing date I received a phone call from HR and arranged an interview for the upcoming week.  The interview was with my would be line manager but somewhat oddly also with the two people I would be managing if I got the role.  The interview was a pretty standard bland affair with all 3 taking it in turns down the row to recite prepared questions. Mostly standard questions for this area but then a few that were so niche to how BHF works that it wouldn't be possible to prepare in any real way for. There was also a fair few questions about how to handle internal issues and agencies going above your head which didn't suggest good things!  Ultimately I didn't get offered the job probably down to my lack of managerial experience and being very handons with the actual work but I think I would have turned it down if offered anyway as there just wasn't a good vibe about the job.,0.9981614,0.0017115241,0.00012705351
"I applied within store to the staff I was already working with at the time I got an interview as expected and had it with the Area manager and Store Manager.   I got declined because the Area manager considered at the time that I had a ""Lack of Experience""   Now I'd be fine with this normally. A perfectly valid reason I can understand and reason BUT.  A week or (couple of weeks) later I overheard the manager of the store offer the exact same role to an 18 year old who had no prior experience either.

One round with a 3person panel. Competencybased questions were provided ahead of the interview which I found really helpful and enabled me to demonstrate strong examples of experience. The interview lasted roughly 1 hr with plenty of introduction to the role and time for questions at the end.  My biggest frustration was the post interview communication. I was told I would hear quickly (within 24hrs) and then waited over a week for a generic unsuccesful email.  I felt the interview went really well and that I demonstrated every example the role was looking for. I also felt I built a good repour with the panel and so I requested feedback which was never recieved.  I would have liked to understand where I wasnt successfull and any areas of improvement.   I was impressed with the brand however the experience and poor communication does have an impact on perception of what it might be like to work as part of that organisation and team and so given the overall experience I wouldnt apply for roles with the British Red Cross in the future.,0.99039626,0.009186687,0.00041702663

Two stage. Provided with case study 2 days prior to interview.  Initial interview 30 minutes (but late letting me on call and interviewer eating).  Panel of 2.  One of the panel had an extremely aggressive interview style going off topic and making off the cuff remarks in a very acerbic manner.   No questions regarding management experience only casework. No opportunity to ask any questions at all.  Very odd questions unrelated to role.  The whole interview was bordering on the surreal (reminder to the BRC  interviews are a two way process and 2 seconds in I was fully aware that I could not work in this environment).,0.9981164,0.0017325135,0.0001511479

This was a two stage interview for a new 12 month FTC role. Prior to both interviews they sent the questions over both interviews came with a task.   The first round was set for 1.5h (but took more than 2h) which included a 30min excel/sql test. There were 3 interviewers (hiring manager and two stakeholders). The next day I received an email from one of the interviewers saying they’d like to invite me to the next and last round  again a 1.5h interview with 3 interviewers (hiring manager and one stakeholder from the first round joined by another stakeholder). In preparation they asked me to put together a presentation about a project that I was proud of/that had a lot of impact.  About a week after that final interview I got an automated email telling me I was unsuccessful but with no further feedback. So after almost 4h of interviewing and several hours preparation they couldn’t even drop me a personalised note. I emailed the interviewers about this but so far nothing.

I applied for multiple positions at this company. Fair enough looking back I wasn’t really suited for the roles and I don’t expect this company to spend a whole lot of time on me for feedback especially in a pandemic. But what really irritated me about this company in particular was how they not only refused to give any kind of feedback at all they actually have the cheek to ask YOU for feedback on how their recruitment processes were!  If you can’t be bothered to treat your candidates right and give a tiny summary of what I did right and wrong why should I bother applying again or even giving you guys feedback on your internal systems?  For a charity that does a lot of good in the world you need to look inwards I dread to wonder how your staff are treated.,0.9980611,0.0017374138,0.00020145338

They didn't ask any generic questions (which I really don't like) and basically asked followup questions about things I mentioned in the application.  About 30m of the interview consisted of hypothetical scenarios type questions. They test your personality experience and common sense.    I didn't get the job and asked for feedback. They replied rather quickly and were very kind. I didn't have enough sales experience in their view so they suggested volunteering with them and then applying again if possible.

The interview consisted of an excel and word assessment followed by a competency based interview before a panel of 2 with approximately 10 questions.  The whole process took about an hour.  I received an email 3 working days after the interview to say that I had been unsucessful and that if I wanted feedback then I should let them know.  I emailed back to ask if feedback could be provided in writing or whether they only gave verbal feedback and despite chasing I am still waiting on a response/acknowledgement over 2 weeks later which I find more disappointing than not getting the job.,0.9988249,0.0010335983,0.00014143446

There was a group interview. They asked you to introduce yourself. From here they then group you with other people where you create an imaginary product and attempt to sell it to the interviewers.  Fairly easy interview however only about 2 or 3 out of up to 15 people from each interview progress to training. The interviewers are extremely friendly and attempt to relax you. You get free coffee and water. I would advise turning up a bit early to prepare yourself.

One panel member clearly had no interest in the whole process was rude multiple times and couldnt wait to leave  quickly threw on her jacket as I was about to leave the room. The one question I had for them about what its like working for BRC they couldn't even answer which made me feel like it wasn't the right place for me.

Most of the staff appeared to be relaxed at the time I had a good impression of the company at the time. It was a relaxing atmosphere. Interview seemed like a standard competency based interview. Unfortunately some companies don't get back to you even after an interview. I felt that this company would be different based on their values and what they do. No response even though I was told would hear back from someone by a certain time. Since they weren't courteous enough to adhere to what they told me it certainly changed my impression of the company especially since I took time off to attend.,0.6799564,0.31797513,0.0020685173

The area manager asked 3 or 4 questions then the other two asked a couple of questions each. The area manager then spoke a bit about the shop and the role and what would be expected. They then asked if there were any questions I had.  Overall the questions were fairly straight forward. How would you increase sales? What would you do if your store was suffering losses to make up the deficit? It is a normal working day tell me how you would run the shop? What things would you do?

I attended the interview in person at their office approx 1 hour. The outcome was emailed to me which in this case was a rejection. I replied asking for feedback and the admin person seemed confused that I had not received a phone call prior to her email and seemed under the impression I already knew. I advised her that her email was the first I knew about the outcome. She confirmed she would get someone to contact me with feedback. I did not hear anything so a while later I repeated my request but again nobody bothered to respond.

The interview I attended in general were good. However the recruitment team is by far the worst team for communication I have come across in any job search.  I was invited for an initial telephone interview with a recruiter who then did not call me as scheduled I received a call the following week. Just general experience questions for 20 minutes.  I was then invited to another telephone interview with the hiring manager. It took 40 minutes. All situational questions. The manager was very friendly and forthcoming in answering my questions. He called when scheduled. I was told i would find out of my success by the end of the week on the Wednesday. I was not contacted at all just sent an email invite to book in my face to face email on the following Tuesday.  For the face to face interview i had to prepare a presentation. For this i put a lot of time and effort into creating and rehearsing. Following the presentation i answering more situational interview questions. At the end of the interview i was told i would be contacted at the end of the week to be told if i have been successful.  I contacted the recruiter at the end of the week as it was nearing the end of the day and was then told that I will be contacted on the Monday.   From there i have heard nothing. It has been a following two weeks so i presume i have not been successful even though they have not updated their recruitment portal and it still states pending.  Considering the amount of time and effort i had put into the interview process the least a company can do is inform the candidate if they are successful or not. It is rude and given me a horrible impression of the company as a whole. I was fairly excited to interview for Bromford but now I will avoid and advise as many peope to avoid also.

I applied through the company website within a few days I had received an email asking me my availability for a video interview  which I confirmed.  I was then sent an email confirmation for our interview which was through MS Teams. A task had also been attached to complete prior to the interview.  The date for the video interview came and I attended it. I was also asked to do a short roleplay within the interview of which they said I had done great at.  At the end of the interview they told me I'd hear back from them by the 9th of June.  It's now the 17th of June and I have heard absolutely nothing back.  I was initially really excited to be part of working at Cancer Research UK  but after being ghosted by senior members the organisation despite spending hours of time I'll never get back completing tasks doing roleplays and attending video interviews...I really would much prefer to stay far away.  If the hiring managers don't even have the human decency to get back to somebody or honour their promises at the interview stage I can only imagine how else I might have been disrespected if I had joined the role. Surely it isn't that difficult to send someone an email or give them a call with an update on the outcome of their interview?

There were A LOT of questions asking specific things about the job itself e.g. what will your day look like. Not a question you'd expect considering you have not done the job before. There were also questions like what's your favourite film  I think they really wanted to find someone that fit in well with the team.  However I was so flustered from the difficult previous questions that I did not react well to these.  I was unsuccessful with getting the job however what I think is totally disrespectful and arrogant is that I wasn't phoned to find this out I wasn't even emailed by the interviewees. I was sent a generic automated email rejection. Something that I don't think is deserved of a person who prepped every day for a week for the interview took a day out for the interview and paid for the train fare.

"CRUK for me has been the epitome of rubbish candidate experience. I applied for a role and then didn’t hear anything for a month and a half. Then all of a sudden out of the blue I get a message from  their internal recruiter very late at night asking to have a phone interview “initial chat” tomorrow (the day after). Obviously this left me no time to prepare for this or take time off work but I managed to get some time off to make this happen.   The recruiter then called me (late) and kicked off the interview. Turns out this is not an “initial chat” but an actual full phone interview with no time to prepare. The recruiter was asking me very intrusive questions such as my exact current salary but when asked didn’t give me any indication of what pay was on offer. She then made a ""hmmmm"" noise and said well to be honest this is not within our range” which made it sound like I earn too little/much for this job (again no idea how much that was meant to be  it was the same job title as I have now).   For the rest of the interview the recruiter was very snobbish and condescending saying how “we get a lot of people applying from smaller organisations like you but because we are the largest org in UK they just don’t cut it for us”. A bit of a pointless comment then since you are the largest obviously everyone else is smaller? Why invite me for an interview? Then she tried to bring me down every way possible saying “all OUR HR staff are very STRATEGIC they do a lot of STRATEGY”. She didn’t seem to be able to explain what that meant so my guess is that she had no understanding of the role whatsoever and was just hung up on repeating the word “strategy”. I told her of my experience doing strategic projects and managing teams but it didn’t seem to matter too much.   She then said “well I will be having words with hiring manager but either way we will get in touch with the outcome in a few weeks”. Needless to say this was months ago and I never heard back! Giving feedback and letting people know is essentially this woman’s job  the ONE job she is specifically hired to do. But no.  Then funnily enough I got approached with this same role but not directly  by an agency who marketed it as “junior” role and mentioned the salary  and there was nothing overly “strategic” about it although in the interview this was sold to me as a “senior strategic role” basically out of my reach because I am doing the same job but at a smaller place. Genius.   I believe this organisation thinks it can afford to have rubbish candidate experiences take months to make decisions not keep candidates updated talk down to them etc and still get the best talent  I don’t think so. And please cut down on the snobbism  largest does not necessarily mean the best.",0.9980744,0.0017880253,0.00013755925

The interview which was a competency based was very intense meaning experience was key in answering the questions.

I applied for the fundraising stream of internships and invited for an interview. Before the interview I was sent an overview of the 5 different fundraising roles but on the day I was told that I was only being interviewed for 1 specific role which meant I hadn't prepared as much as I would of liked.

There was a one hour interview with two panel members followed by a test sent through by email later in the week. The women that interviewed me clearly had little to no experience interviewing as they were both very quiet and seemed extremely nervous themselves. They hardly engaged with me and made me feel considerably more nervous than I would have been. Both seemed young and inexperienced.   There was a lot of questions a little too many in my opinion it was unnecessary. Also I believe interviewers are supposed to prompt you a little if they require more information but this did not happen.   Also I was surprised to find they didn't ask me why I wanted to work for CRUK? They asked what made me want to apply for the role. But not a single question about the company. Which was annoying as the bulk of my research on CRUK was based on them as a company. I had to find a way to work what I had learnt in the questions at the end.,0.99744225,0.0024304544,0.00012735902

Arrived slightly early so asked to use the toilet I was told I would have to go to the mc Donald's round the corner as interview was taking place. Finally got to start interview 30 minutes late as interviews were running late.  Was told nothing about the role at all including salary area or what was expected etc. Was asked a lot of stupid questions which test how quickly you can make up a story to impress them. I was also asked about an old colleague of mine who has recently joined CRUK who I didn't particularly like because they were lazy and took the credit for everyone else's work. I thought this was totally unprofessional. I didn't get the job and it's taken the best part of a month to get the feedback I requested. I really had a lucky escape.

"Lasted roughly 45 minutes. I was made to feel very welcome by my interviewees. Format is formal  the panel had about 10 questions to ask me which were obviously from a script designed by Cats Protection. I was not offered the job and received feedback that was constructive but in some ways also quite unfair. I think going forward Cats Protection would benefit from moving away from the archaic ""one size fits all"" questions and tailoring their questions to the individual based on their background and experience. There were a couple of questions I had to ask for further clarification for and one in particular which I think was what cost me the job offer was unnecessarily vague in its wording even after asking them to elaborate. Interview questions should be accessible to all  generic questions lead to generic answers. To be told in feedback I didn't have a good understanding of something that is critical in my current role was disappointing to say the least!

Best interview I've had asked questions specifically relevant to my ability to do the job rather than 'what are your weaknesses'. Interviewers were friendly and made up those members of the team I would be working with directly. The written test was fun and manageable though stressful given the time constraints.

I enjoyed the interview process very much. I applied to a Department doing research which coaligns with my personal and academic interests during university.

3 stage interview  Phone Test (Psychology  maths!?) 1:1 I had a phone interview with test after that I never heard from them again. I even sent a followup  no response. The human decency require to at least finish what you started. If you started the interview process it would be great to send a response. If someone is sending a followup is so hard to give a one sentence with some feedback?   Also what is the point of giving such a high level maths test or any maths test for the HR position?

2 stage interview. Promised feedback after both stages but never received anything. Also promised a phone call regarding other potential role but never called. Incredibly slow and uncoordinated.

The process was conducted through a mixture of different mediums depending on the stage. I kicked off with a half hour phone interview with a friendly marketing consultant who (I think) just wanted to ascertain I had the knowledge / experience indicated on my CV. He also took some time out to tell me more about the CIPD; the project I'd be working on if successful the progress they'd made and where the role I applied for would fit into the overall strategy.   I then had a couple of faceto face interviews with people from two different teams as the role worked with both. The interviews were relaxed and friendly so I felt at ease and able to give the best answers I could. I also wrote a report which responded to a hypothetical scenario saying what I would do and why. Overall it was a good mixture and although there were a lot of stafes (four altogether) it meant that when I was offered the role I felt really comfortable that I'd be a good fit.,0.0019699067,0.70881516,0.2892149

The interview consisted of a 15 minute presentation followed by competency based questions and in total lasted about an hour. I attended for interview some 2 months ago at end of August and was advised that I would be being invited for second interview and that the date would be confirmed in due course. I had infrequent  intermittent contact from the hiring manager following first interview and needed to chase a date for second interview. I was advised the delay was owing to difficulties with coordination of managment diaries. After waiting circa 2 months I was advised that the role had been withdrawn and was no longer being recruited for owing to changes within the business. I appreciate that business circumstances do change sometimes at quite short notice however I feel that improved and more frank and honest communications would have provided a better candidate experience.

Very conflicted here as the recruitment contact was fantastic with an excellent process; great communications and expectation setting. Even admitted they made a mistake and allowed me extra time to answer the previously missing questions from the application; and allowed extra time for the application. I was encouraged by the anonymised cover letter and CV requirement so that prejudice was not entered into. However the interview as not so great. The panel were inexperienced delivering interviews and my impression was that their ideal candidate is someone that fitted one of the panel's  agenda. despite the clear lack of Cyber Security experience demonstrated.  One of the panel had no Cyber Security qualifications or certifications so I believe a Cyber professional should have been contracted for the interview process.

Interviewed for the Policy Research position which was being recruited for the Consumer Team with a specific remit in private renting sector policy. The recruitment advertisement didn't mention this and was quite generic. Despite this the written task asked us to develop a policy brief on improving the rights of renters. I feel the interview would have been much fairer if this specialist knowledge was mentioned ahead of time as the interview process likely favoured internal candidates who may have already been aware of which teams were recruiting.  I was very impressed with the lead recruiter in this interview who was very friendly and personable. Unfortunately one of the other panel members looked very disinterested and seemed distracted by something else in the room (this was an online interview). This made it quite difficult to perform and at one stage I nearly terminated the interview early because of this.,0.98942137,0.010285136,0.0002935595

Applied on Monday and was offered an interview by the Friday for the following Friday. Did my research spoke to many other people who had worked or volunteered for Citizen’s Advice and was told about their great online training scheme and what a great place it was to work. Was really excited to interview  but I wouldn’t have exactly called it one. I arrived and was in and out within about 15 minutes or so. There was one single interviewer who mixed up my degree with one on another person’s application and that was the first red flag. I didn’t have much of a chance to speak and felt the whole interview was just the interviewer talking at me  very informal.  The interviewer went over the job title contract and benefits and spoke about the role (rather negatively without much enthusiasm). They also told me how long they would be doing interviews for that day as if it was a hassle not the most professional. It was almost as if the interviewer was trying to deter me from the job with the way it was being discussed and I knew from that point there would not be an employment offer.  At one point I was asked to tell the interviewer about myself the only chance I really had to speak. They explained that they’re looking for someone who pretty much knows exactly how to do the job already as they don’t have the resources or staff to train anyone. This left me rather confused as: a) I had been informed by multiple people of their extensive online training and b) in that case why would they hold external interviews as opposed to an internal recruitment process? The interviewer confirmed with me again that I had not volunteered previously and without saying the words made it quite clear that they were looking for someone who had. Luckily I was contacted only a few hours after the interview to be told I was unsuccessful due to my lack of experience and again how they needed someone who could do the job with no training. I believe that if they required someone who had volunteered in the past this should have been specified on the job advert. Just by comparing my application forms with the other candidates it was evident I hadn’t volunteered or held this exact position before  so I really have no idea why I was invited to interview.  I was really disappointed with the interview process and expected so much better. I felt that my time had been wasted as I wasn’t going to be hired anyway due to not meeting the criteria that the interviewer had and knew I didn’t meet after reading my application. I do believe that there was perhaps an interviewing quota that had to be met and best case I was known not to be suitable beforehand or worst case someone was already chosen for the role and this was simply going through the motions. The whole experience was very disheartening and draining. I would like to remind recruiters and interviewers alike that applicants are real people with real lives and commitments. Should someone not meet (undisclosed) criteria from reading their application please do not waste their time and energy interviewing them if there is absolutely no chance they were in the running for the role anyway. I would urge future applicants/interviewees alike to be prepared for this scenario. This was just my experience of one bureau and may not well be the case for anyone else. Nonetheless I am very disappointed by the whole situation and would be very hesitant to apply for a job within this organisation again.,0.9943294,0.005168568,0.0005020588

Completed a long application form sent it online received an invitation for 2 part interview a week later.  Communication via email to setup the interview was very warm and welcoming however the interview itself was awful. This is the first feedback I've ever felt I had to give as I was just that disappointed.  It was clear they didn't read the application form prior to the interview as they asked the exact same questions during the interview that were in the application form (including the initial screening questions!)  Similarly to other reviews of the interview process for CAB the interviewers were unresponsive and came across very cold throughout.  They spent most of their time reading from a piece of paper without looking at the camera. After each answer they simply moved onto the next question without making a noise saying anything or asking another question based on my initial answer it did come across that they weren't even listening to what was being said  interviews are also supposed to be a 2 way conversation. Even more shocking considering CAB's nature of work of working with people.  I'm not surprised myself and other people checked out during the interviews.,0.99655896,0.003125322,0.00031566634

I applied online the advert was for 4 content designer roles of varying contract lengths. I was invited to interview by a hiring manager.  On the interview day I was taken to a small room to do a 50 minute written task before the interview. The room was incredibly hot and noisy due to thin walls/people next door so quite difficult to concentrate. By the time I got into the interview I was pretty fed up  this task could have been done from home and saved us all time.  The interview itself was with a panel of 3. It was all generic competency questions with no opportunity for dialogue. I couldn't get much of a sense of how the team worked as my questions were met with fairly basic answers. I don't think they had read my application.  This panel were interviewing for one role in particular they didn't seem to know about the other 3 roles from the advert (and I had no HR contact to ask).  I heard nothing back until I chased them 2 weeks later when they did at least provide feedback.  Generally an uninspiring experience and I wasn't disappointed by the rejection.

The interview process was friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the interviewers. Tasks followed what was expected from prep work. I was however very disappointed not to receive any feedback from my interview despite asking 4 times and it being promised to me. I understand this is difficult for companies at application stage but having spent a lot of time preparing for an interview presentation and additional skills task (on top of a written application and further written short answer questions) I felt quite let down.

Provided with a sample of the questions the night before a 45 minute interview. One of the panel spent much of this looking outside at whatever was going on elsewhere and throughout one question was laughing at something on her screen.  Perhaps they thought this shows a happy spirit; it’s actually just very disrespectful to someone who had been considering working for the charity. It would have been average difficulty but the attitude made it very difficult and uncomfortable.,0.76580185,0.23335546,0.00084273994

I interviewed with the Creative Service Lead and Marketing Manager. Taking them through the work the Creative Service Lead pointed to a particular campaign and asked me a question which gave me pause: she asked me when the campaign was created.   I suspected that out of the ten campaigns presented she only asked about the date of particular campaign as a way to gauge my age (it was the only one in the portfolio that indicated it was done over ten years ago by the celebritys in the ads) which is discriminatory goes against their values and despite being Comic Relief not a laughing matter.,0.9951691,0.0046642325,0.00016662608

Very strange interview. Both of the interviewers were leaving the company. In the case of the CTO he wasn’t being replaced which I found very odd but apparently the board had decided that the company didn’t need a CTO. Based on what they said I’m not entirely sure they know what they want for the data department either but I wasn’t able to find out more on this as there was no time allotted for questions from candidates. The interview started slightly late and I was rushed through every question. Typically I would start answering and then the CTO would interject and ask a follow up question before telling me that we were behind schedule. The CTO checked his phone on a few occasions and  told me that he had to reply to a business message that was sent otherwise there would be an outage. I found this to be unprofessional but to be fair he did apologise.  It seemed to me that he was very much needed after all.  My main frustration was that there were too many questions for the time allotted. The fact that they didn’t even have my cv in front of them made it more difficult. Their feedback to the recruitment consultant was that my answers were not concise enough indicating that I would struggle with their stakeholders. My feedback to them would be  it is impossible to give top three career highlights in 2 minutes when you are asked follow up questions almost as soon as you start answering. Frustratingly even before the interview they questioned my suitability as they said that it wasn’t obvious from my cv that I had the skills and experience to deal with their apparently difficult stakeholders. This is despite my nearly 20 years experience with the technology stack they are using and the fact that my current job title is Product Manger. Obviously stakeholder management is a big part of my role. The equally frustrated rec con told me that the feedback about me was almost identical to feedback to the previous candidate who had said the same thing about his interview and they had said the same thing about him. It was difficult to set up a time for the interview in the first place as both the interviewers and myself were very busy with work. I moved a few things around to fit into one of the few time slots that they could make but I don’t feel I had their full attention or that I got a fair crack at it. They were obviously preoccupied with the sport relief campaign and maybe it was a bad time for them. I have a very good record at interviews and am confident that I could have been successful in the job. The suggestion that I didn’t have the skills or experience is frankly ridiculous. If anything it would have been a step down from what I am currently doing as the development team at comic relief is half the size of my current team and my responsibilities in my current role outweigh those of the job advertised.  Without revealing where I work I can’t  imagine comic relief stakeholders being more difficult than my current stakeholders and would have welcomed a chance to talk to them and let them make a call instead of two people who were leaving the company. Before the interview I was very keen to work there and would have been prepared to take a pay cut to work for a charity such as this but it’s possible that I’ve dodged a bullet.,0.9983374,0.0015317587,0.00013079552

As a recruiter myself but in the position of interviewee  I felt the attention and focus given to me was proportional in all aspects of recruitment.,0.0019865164,0.97578,0.02223339

Interviewed by two people. They were expecting a lot of experience and skills but offering very little pay. I was asked nine scenario based questions. Contract job uncertainty over whether they'd keep you on after the nine months. They need to offer a fair salary to people and not just pennies above the minimum wage. This is unprofessional and they can only expect a high staff turnover.,0.99877733,0.0010691496,0.00015342658
The interview process was very long considering the low salary.  I applied and was selected to attend a group interview. In the group interview there were ten of us (quite a large number!) and we broke off into two groups. We were given 8 descriptions of videos and had to to detail how we could gain publicity for each one. We then fed back to the group.  Strangely we then had to fill out essentially another application form again independently. We were only given 20 minutes to do this and the interviewer was pressurizing us all to hurry up and finish writing every so often. It was a very lengthy formwe had to describe why we wanted the role what experience we had etc. Unsure why as I had already done this in my initial application form! Some of the questions in this form were unusual and did not allow people to show themselves in the best light. E.g. Name three weaknesses? (one would be fair enough but three?!?! ) Name something that would affect your ability to do this role (I wouldn't have applied if I thought I couldn't do the role?) We then moved on to do an independent proof reading task. This made more sense for the job role proof reading a letter. We had half an hour to do this.  IF we were successful at group interview we'd then be invited to a second interview! (I wasn't)  Overall I found the interview to be very full on indeed! I felt that from the off we were under a great deal of time pressure and by the end my hands were aching because we had to do so much writing! I thought filling in another application form was pointless and I thought considering some of the ten of us had traveled far to be at the GROUP interview we should have done more group work.   In every other PR role that I have applied for they have been for higher salaries and have involved a simple individual interview with a press release writing task. Unlike every other interview I have attended Creative Support have  not provided any interview feedback.,0.99806386,0.0017785599,0.0001575785

It was an online application process following which i was invited to a group interview at headquarters. There were about 8 others in the group interview it was easy to get drowned out when speaking about the scenarios they told us. They encourage everyone to talk. I managed to speak but i'd probably suggest trying to input information at every round. There was a section of this interview where you had to fill in a form of questions for twenty minutes.The group interview lasted about an hour and a half. I was then emailed that i had progressed from the group interview and invited to another interview in the residential house i would be working in. This interview lasted for an hour and included being asked questions by a service user.,0.9502464,0.049295757,0.0004578807
This review if just for the first interview of the two interview process The first interview is a 'group discussion'. This is a 2 hour interview and they seem to forget to tell you this so prepare for a lengthy session. The first hour is all about writing. You have 25 minutes to fill out a packet of questions all about you and another packet about your personalities. The second packet is used to match you up with a service user in the event that you are selected for the position. Be aware of time! I personally did not have the time to finish the section about myself and was forced to hand in the packet when only half of the questions were answered. Following this you get a case study and have 25 minutes to answer 4 questions regarding the case study. This was enough time to complete the all the questions. The next hour is about the case study you all just read. There are about 10 questions (different than the written questions) in which you all discuss what you would do in each scenario.,0.99456257,0.00523628,0.00020115079

A long winded application form which took time and dedication to complete. Shortlisted to group interview which would then be followed by a 1:1 interview.The group interview was very bizarre. Initially there were questions to be answered on paper roughly 5 which were related to the role.

Interviewed by 2 people. Interview was 30 mins long and was based mostly on the application questions. A lot of focus on selling and sales and not much emphasis on History.  I was sitting between the shop and the museum on a swivel chair which was very distracting!

Interview took at least two and half hours when it could easily have been done in one hour.  There was a lot of unnecessary  waiting around.

We discussed the items and came up with ways to sell them.  Then we were watched by numerous interviewers as we did a group problem solving activity.

Interviewed by 2 EH staff for a historic property steward role. OK interview lack of focus on the history and contents of the building which is surely why someone would want to work there. Seemed more interested in how I could raise revenue for the company. Sadly it was another tick box exercise in fulfilling the requirements  on paper rather then looking at the individual in  front of them and how their job experience was valid.  Poor communication I emailed after 5 days to see how it was progressing only to have to wait another 5 days to hear back from the member of EH staff who interviewed me to learn I had been unsuccessful no feedback was offered so I enquired whether this was possible to help with application forms such as this. Eventually they got back to me with feedback reason being that I hadn't been successful was due to my lack of 'till and tourism' experience which is frankly insulting when I have over 4 years experience in customer facing hospitality & significant cash handling. To conclude the whole experience left a very bad impression of the company as a whole.,0.9985898,0.0012663878,0.00014380337

Applied through a recruitment agency first stage was a telephone interview. Following that I was asked to attend an inperson interview and to prepare a presentation giving an indepth look at the performance of one of their properties. There was also a written test to assess SQL skills and knowledge of Google Analytics and other digital analytics tools such as regular expressions (regex).

Two tests.  One was a prioritisation of tasks and the other was to do a response letter to a customer complaint.  Followed by interview with two managers.   Both people were clearly tired of interviewing by the time they saw me.  I got no feedback on the tasks that I carried out.  Their interviewing technique was very inflexible.  There was no opportunity to showcase my ability to to do the job.  I had a portfolio which they declined to look at.  Every question was about dealing with stress.  This would have been a relatively stress free post and so I feel that the questions posed were a little inappropriate.  The role involved was clearly customer service based.  This is an area in which I am fully competent but they did not allow for any diversification from the questions that they had on a sheet of paper.

The interview itself was fine. I then was emailed 2 weeks later to be offered a second interview a month later I had been offered a position with a different company by this point and let them know. I was then emailed again 2 weeks after being offered a second interview and turning them down  that they would not be taking my application further!

Advertised position on their website. Lengthy application with questions requiring somewhat of essay length responses.  Received a phone call inviting me to the interview. Interview session began with a group of applicants sitting around a large table. I'm sure we were being observed while we engaged with each other. They split the group into two. We played a game where we had to imagine we were in Canada in the winter and needed to survive but had to choose from a list of suggested objects those that would help us in our survival and why. The panel watched how we interacted with each other. After that we pulled out of a bag a stationery object. We then had minutes to come up with a sales pitch to sell it the object to the individual who woul be interviewing us.

The position was advertised in the local paper but the job description was generic and much more complicated than was actually needed to do the job.  Vacancies are also advertised on the company website and you can register for job alerts.  The application form on line is really good as after you have filled it in for one position you can use it again if applying for another job as your details are remembered.  Interviews may be by a panel of line managers concerned with your particular role.  It is good to do some research prior to interview and it may be possible to go on a tour to find out more about the place where you will be working.  Water is provided at interviews and staff take it in turns to ask questions.  You may need to sit a test for some roles.  People are selected for interview according to their skills experience and appropriate attributes for the role.

I applied for the remote investigator role that FOS are currently advertising. The first step was an online situational judgement test then a few days later I was invited to complete a daily task ordering exercise and a case study in which you have to write a View to either a business or customer. This depends on if you uphold or defend a complaint. I was invited to an interview a few days after this. The email stated they would send over details of what to expect in the interview a few days prior to the date chosen. I called up the resource line as I hadnt received this 2 days before the interview. The chap said he'd send it straight through to me but he didnt. I received the info around 10am and the interview was a few hours later so that wasnt great. The email gave 3 competency areas to focus on and stated they would ask 1 question from each area which they didnt. The interviewers (Luke and John) started by asking some basic organisational questions which seemed to go very well. They followed up by going through the task ordering exercise and View that I’d completed previously. The guys seemed more than happy with what Id done and I felt strongly this was a good sign. They then asked several (more than 3) competency questions that Ive listed below. I used the star technique to answer. They didn’t ask follow up questions or probe any of my answers really which I new from previous experience is a bad sign that the answers weren’t what they were looking for. Not everyone interviews well under pressure and competency questions are never robust enough to show off a persons skills. If the Interviewers are not very good at leading someone to give them the information they’re looking for with probing questions they’re not always going to get them even when people are perfectly equipped to do the job. That’s why a lot of work places in my experience have so many people get through interviews but can’t do the job they’ve been hired to do. I felt that this was the case here. I could do the job in my sleep and Id enjoy it but my first interview in 12 years and I had no idea the sort of things they were looking for in my competency responses. In my feedback they explained the answers weren’t strong enough and although my experience was good I didn’t tick all their boxes with the competencies. Im sorry I cannot give more help on that as Im still not sure what they wanted. Just make sure your competencies are strong and robust and you have a lot of them.,0.99209434,0.007694249,0.00021142607

"3 stages  (1) CV sift (2) Written task (consisting of an intray prioritisation task and writing a view) (3) Interview with a HR rep and an Ombudsman. The written task was fairly straightforward you are asked to spend no more than 90 mins on it although you can spend longer/shorter if you like. With regards to the view written task there is no real right or wrong answer the idea is for you to be able to explain your rationale based on the circumstances. The interview was conducted remotely and mine was horrendously unprofessional. The HR member was smirking and rolling his eyes at many of my answers as well as looking away from the screen to laugh/chat to the ombudsman or someone else in the room who I couldn't see. It was so off putting that it made me go off track and feel uncomfortable with my following answers. I was declined (which was expected from their attitude in the interview) and the email specified that I could ask for feedback which I did. That was ignored and I still haven't heard anything almost a month after. So much for them living their values and ""Doing what we say we'll do"". I would not apply again ever let alone after 6 months.",0.99578685,0.004023703,0.00018941493
HR did not provide an honest feedback about the written assignment. I felt like they did not want to spend time with me advising how I should have answer. No guidance and no interest in answer my doubts when I request a call to receive feedback. Not sure if I will apply again after 6 months because of this.

Had 4 steps to the interview. First was with the recruiter second with a hiring manager the third was to prepare a case study/presentation. I mainly dealt with a recruiter. I interviewed in their London  Canary Wharf office and they told me they would inform me of their final decision by the next week. The company and the recruiter didn't provide me with any updates even though I emailed him (Ashdown Agency) and it had been a month with no response. Its highly inconsiderate to interview and take up peoples time and not update them with a decision.

I found the application on Indeed and then applied direct through the Ombudsman's website. Provided a CV and Covering letter which set out answers to two competency based questions. Then completed a verbal reasoning test and a telephone interview.  I did not get passed the interview stage.   I applied for the role as I was working within a legal background and was knowledgeable about the financial products that the Ombudsman dealt with. (The job application was looking for someone specifically with a legal background and who knew about financial products).   I was able to answer all questions given to me and provide some really good examples of work I had done that suited me to this role. I had the exact experience the company was after and felt I was quite well suited to the role.   The interview did feel very dry however. The interviewer gave off the vibe that she really wasn't interested from the get go and almost just felt like a robot reading off the screen. (A similar review to someone else on here). I made sure at the end of the interview to ask if there was anything I could expand upon which I did. The interviewer at the end agreed I had ticked off her boxes. The interviewer said it would be a couple of days before they would come back to me with a decision.   I received a decision back the same day with a rejection.   I get the impression that the Ombudsman had already filled all the roles up and just had to finish off interviews in any event.,0.8834037,0.116194606,0.00040178723
Very quick process. 5 stages of recruitment: CV/ Cover letter; verbal reasoning tests; telephone interview; case study and finally a face to face interview (remote due to COVID19).  I applied online through the FOS website by submitting my CV and a covering letter. The next day I was sent a link to complete 2 verbal reasoning tests. After passing these I was invited to a telephone interview the next week.  The telephone interview lasted between 2030 minutes and the man who interviewed me was very friendly. Here I was asked competency based questions. At the end of the telephone interview I was told that they would be progressing my application to the next stage. I was then asked to complete a case study where I had to make a decision. The case study was fairly simple and gives you an idea of what you would be doing on the job. I was worried about the case study but don't it just requires common sense. The case study was then marked by an ombudsman manger.  After successfully completing the case study I was offered a remote interview with someone from HR and an ombudsman manager. Both of my interviewers were very friendly and made me feel relaxed during the interview. They asked me questions about the case study and then some competency based questions. The interview was less than an hour long. They said that they would get back to me within 24 hours  which they did!,0.00342026,0.8465444,0.15003538

I have very little customer service experience as evidenced in my initial application. Nevertheless I attempted to tailor an answer to the ""dealing with a difficult customer"" question as best as I could but ultimately I think my answer was pretty poor.

Be confident tailoring your answers and don't stumble if you're caught off guard.  Finally the phone connection was pretty terrible.

One word to describe the recruitment process at the FOS..... (Pathetic!). Please read this review and previous reviews on interviews and the company itself before applying for this role.  I was contacted by a recruitment agency (You will be approached like this) and the recruiter went through my CV and asked if I am interested in the role. If you say yes then you will be invited to a phone interview that will last for 3040 minutes. In order to prepare for this interview you will need to prepare for the competency questions that will be asked relating to the 'role' (note how I emphasised the word 'role'). If you pass this phone interview  you will then be invited to a verbal reasoning test. If you pass that then you will get a written excercise where you will have to write a response to a complaint. Now here's the catch. No matter how clearly you explain the issue on the complaint and reach a valid conclusion if you pass; you will still have to give reasons as to why you reached that response regardless of already giving a detailed reason in the written excercise. After passing the written excericse you will be invited to a face to face interview. Now this is where it gets interesting. You will be informed beforehand that the interview will be based on first talking about the case study then just general question regarding FOS and finally competency question on the role (so basically a repeat of the same questions that were asked by the recruiter but by using different examples). Now I would understand how important the star technique is for interviews and I have used this in an effective manner in the past but to be told that you need to add certain things in your answers for these questions to actually answer these questions is ridiculous). How can you brag about promoting diversity if you want a certain type of answer from a applicant. You constantly report promoting diverse working environment and say that this prevents this one size fits all ideal at workplace but are doing the exact opposite on interviews?  I see many negative reviews here regarding the company prior to applying and I thought that these reviews were only written in spite as these individuals did not  get the job but after applying for this role. I was wrong.  And while we are at it lets address the elephant in the room. For those of you wondering who this recruitment agency is? It goes by the name of Addecco. Good luck stay blessed and avoid this organisation the best you can!,0.9916447,0.008148408,0.00020691057
Quite a long but straightforward process. I had 5 steps in total: initial application verbal reasoning test telephone interview case study and finally the face to face (video) interview.,0.0013134913,0.9982734,0.00041322698
The interview process was long which consisted of 5 stages: 1) Online application; 2) Verbal Reasoning Test; 3) Telephone Interview; 4) Online case study; and 5) Online 'facetoface' Interview. I had to pass each stage to progress towards the next stage.   I applied online on the FOS website which requires you to submit a CV and covering letter.  After succeeding with my initial application I was sent a link to complete their Verbal Reasoning Test which must be completed within 2 days. This was the SHL Verbal Reasoning test where I needed to answer 30 questions in 19 minutes.   After passing this I had to book my 30minute telephone interview within the next week. I had a lady from HR call me and the interview lasted about 17 minutes. She asked me general interview questions about myself and some competency questions.   After passing this stage I received an email to complete their online case study within 2 days. I was presented a case study about a customer asking for a refund for tickets from an organisation. The case study was about a page long. I had to then write a letter to the party who I will be deciding against and give reasons for my decision. I had another question where I had to explain any reasons why I think that party will disagree with my reasoning. I structured my letter in two sections: 1) A brief overview of the complaint; and 2) My Decision with the reasons why. To help with how to structure my answer I researched the FOS website and found a page with decisions made by Investigators on various matters so I tried to follow this structure. It helped me understand common things that Investigators must explain in their decision.   After passing this stage I was invited to the final interview. Due to Covid19 it had to be conducted virtually over Webex. I was interviewed by a lady from HR and another Ombudsman Manager. The interview was an hour long and was split in 3 stages: 1) The Ombudsman Manager discussed my answer in the case study and how I came to that decision. He also tried changing little details from the case study to see if my answer will change. He grilled me very specifically about what method I used to reach the decision; 2) The second stage had strengths/ competency questions and was the longest stage of the interview process. They concentrated on 3 main competencies and asked me questions relating to this. The lady from HR was very positive and friendly but the manager from Ombudsman grilled me intensely about my answers! His next questions would be based on what I said in the previous answer. He tried to grill me about my past job as a Paralegal and tried to challenge the legal knowledge I had explained in the situations for the competency questions which I thought was highly irrelevant. I wasn't sure if he wanted me to provide answers that he thought were irrevocably right or if he was grilling me on purpose to see how well I handle myself when challenged but regardless I explained myself well and stuck to my answers confidently. I'm not sure if I got unlucky with the interviewer I had or if they are all like that but I would come very prepared. 3) The final stage was where I could ask questions about the job which I spent about 10 minutes questioning the role.   I got rejected at the last stage of the application process which was extremely disappointing especially as I thought the final interview had gone well and I had nailed it regardless all that intense grilling. I was told that I would hear back within 48 hours and the rejection email was sent the day after my interview. I had wasted a month and a half going through their long recruitment process and was not even provided with feedback in the rejection email. So I emailed the lady from HR asking for feedback and I was never received a response even now which is extremely rude considering the time and effort I put in preparing for this role.,0.9888565,0.010880373,0.0002631012

The most long winded and worst interview process I have experienced just for the Investigator role basically investigating and responding to complaints.  First was a verbal reasoning test then a telephone Interview then a cover Letter. And once you've overcome all that then you get invited to the 'interview' where you have to respond to a case study and ONLY if you pass that will you go onto the main interview.  Upon entrance into the building the atmosphere was very institutionalised and unfriendly. Eventually you get placed in front of a desk to respond to the case study.  After completing the case study somoene takes your paper and you are asked to wait for about 20 minutes in that same room.  An asian lady appeared eventully and said you were not successful and will not be pproceeding to te next stage. This news was openly spoken with the door wide open with people standing  close by and next to another applicant with his door wide open and therefore heard what happened.  I have never experienced such unprofessionalism and embarrasment at a job interview.  Feedback via the recruiter was later provided stating that my letter lacked reasoning the events were reiterated and the writing was generally poor.  The manner in which this letter was written is industry standard and whilst I welcome all opnions to improve my letter writing i have absolutley no idea what clown was marking the paper  and was written as per their requirments. This is not bitterness but the whole process was a JOKE.   I was told they have rejected many applicants previously and have many vacancies for INVESTIGATOR to feel and now I know why.

An unnecessarily long process including a telephone interview going in for a scenario test and culminating in a traditional interview on a different day but which included reviewing the scenario test (undertaken a couple of weeks prior) in a rather strangely pedantic way. The panel interview was the final stage of the process and you would logically assume that you had done sufficiently at the previous stages but they were picky and pedantic about the test scenario looking for black and white answers. Halfway through the interview I decided I would not take the job if offered so I was not at all disappointed not to be offered the role. The panel included two Ombudsman Leaders who came across as very old school and suspicious of outsiders. Of course you won't get every job but you still generally corm away with a positive experience but not in this case. I can see why the FOS has such negative reviews from former and even current staff. The overriding impression it has left on me is of an organisation that doesn't understand that it isn't possible to change with the same management attitudes  it needs a new fresh and different approach as it does seem that all the internal promotion has made it even more regressive and inward looking.,0.99691296,0.0029029725,0.00018408483

I did pass the task however the following telephone interview was not what I was told to prepare. I  also felt that my current role wasn't fully understood by the interviewer.

Applied through an agency interviewed in their office after a few weeks. I had to do an online data entry and accuracy test. The recruiters seem professional although they have forgotten I had an interview booked.  They emphasize a lot on following the star technique but even if you follow it that might be not enough because you have to remember to say A LOT of details. I mean it is ridiculous in a normal conversation people do ask questions if they want to know more about you in details so why in interviews this is unacceptable? The interview itself was rather long (1hour) they grilled me with a lot of questions asking for very specific details which I have replied thoroughly.  I thought I did very well my examples were real examples and on point. They've reassured me it wasn't that important if I forgot some details in the STAR  answers and helped me in getting knowledge of what they wanted to know.  I have a lot of experience and am a genuine person who really cares about helping people. I genuinely thought I would be selected.  Their feedback was that I didn't follow the STAR approach the way they wanted it. ?  I really do not understand how could they put this first in choosing applicants. Certainly having a good positive approach to people be genuine and hardworking is not enough for them even if you consistently deliver evidence through your stories. Maybe you should completely fabricate your experiences so you can make them happy. Ridiculous.,0.9872343,0.0123348925,0.00043077132

I had to first do a case study which was very basic and simple it required me to read the document and come to a decision i had to write a professional letter explaining my decision. Later had a face to face interview with 2 managers and a HR lady where we discussed the case study in some detail.  They further asked some competency questions. It is important to use the STAR technique. The case study task was 45 minutes and the face to face interview lasted for about 45 minutes too. Make sure you go into the interview prepared with strong examples for the competency questions. Remember to read the job description properly and identify what they are looking for in a person and use this to make your preparations highlight the key skills and experience they are looking for and remember to mention these throughout your examples.,0.66307366,0.336186,0.0007403412
Relatively straightforward process I applied online completed a verbal reasoning test followed by a telephone interview and then face to face interview.  The telephone interview consisted of questions around what you know about the company and why you would be good for the role. You are also asked a couple competency questions around change management and dealing with a difficult customer. The face to face interview consisted of a written exercise and then  a mixture of competency and motivation questions from a 3 person panel. For the written exercise you are given a case study and then told to answer 3 questions about what you have read and write an email/letter of advice to the customer. My only complaint was that I felt more time was needed to complete this section !,0.02334415,0.97606444,0.00059149007
Pleasant enough twostage process. catch up with affable managers who asked relevant questions and a secondary complaint assessment and writing test.  The secondary assessment involved reading over a complaint scenario and writing out a response to the complainant to give them a fair outcome.  It should be noted this was for a contractor position.,0.006623591,0.9928558,0.000520578
"I was recruited by REED and was told there is gonna be a written and a facetoface part of the interview. The whole experience was highly disappointing. These people don't care if you have relevant experience or skills. The only thing they are worried about if you can write a madeup formal letter in 40 minutes without making any grammatical or spelling mistakes. Guess what?! If your letter is not perfect you don't even get to talk to the interviewer they just send you away saying you didn't make to the ""next round"".  No wonder why the reviews of this organisation are so bad. I am just concerned about the customers they get to work with.

Applied online and was given a test to complete after I got shortlisted. Basic test on keyboard speed and accuracy. Came in for a interview a few days later.

Initial communication was good. 2  telephone interviews with standard questions.I was then invited for a more formal interview and assessment.  No feedback at all was provided regarding the assessment.The interview was standard and the majority of staff I encountered polite. Some of the HR staff could do with some training.The main issue I had was the lack of communication and feedback following the interview. I was not offered a role  and was sent a standard we went with other candidates email. I was advised I could have feedback on my interview and assessment. I requested this immediately just so I could understand if there were any areas I need to work on. I still have not had a response.,0.82855433,0.170837,0.0006086367

Interview with two members of HR. Questions were poorlyphrased and repetitive. I was promised that the outcome would be email to me within the next three days but I waited for over two weeks.

The first stage is a CV submitted with covering letter. Telephone interview with recruiter straightforward with a basic understanding of role required. The motivation behind application also questioned. Successful conversations will lead to an interview at London offices. Prior to the interview one is subject to a prescreen test consisting of a grammar test and two accounts of a time when you (enter situational scenarios). If one completes this satisfactorily they attend a facetoface interview. This begins with a 30minute task; write a final response letter to a client (Difficult). Grammar spelling etc are paramount. The second part of the interview process is a 15/20 minute conversation with a FOS manager. Questions entailed CV related queries and motivations for applying (average). Additional technical questioning on a basic understanding of both role and industry are delivered (if prepared then average difficulty). It is then asked of one to present two decisions made by FOS including both uphold and nonuphold (difficult if not fully prepared). These should be preprepared and personal comments/opinions on decisions are desired to gauge candidates way of thinking.

I applied for the role online where I was required to submit a CV and a cover letter. The application process isn't long. Heard from them after a month. Almost thought my application was rejected or simply didn't meet their requirement. Got a call for an interview. On the interview day I had to complete a case study which is really easy. You're given 30 minutes to complete it. Its basically a case study and an application form. You use the information from the case study to fill in the form. If you pass the case study you move onto the interview stage. I passed so I got to the interview stage. The interview was 45 minutes long by two interviewers. They're very friendly and make you settle in. Literally like just having a conversation really but in an interview style.

First stage interview  competency questions HR case study (dealing with poor performance from a team member) and a decision making exercise (assessing a complaint).   Second stage interview  a presentation on the challenges faced by the ombudsman. Also quizzed on the responses I had given to the written test challenged on my thinking and reasoning.   Was unsuccessful. The feedback I received was not constructive. I was told that my decision making was good I defended my position well and they could understand my thinking. They said I came across well and I communicated clearly. The reason they gave for not offering the job was that I hadn't demonstrated decision making skills in the presentation. The presentation was on the challenges faced by the ombudsman so I hadn't used it as an opportunity to showcase my decision making skills as it wasn't obvious that's what they were looking for. And the case study was there to test my decision making. Given that they couldn't provide a good reason for not offering me the role I concluded that my face just didn't fit for whatever reason.   As a side note whilst I was waiting for my interview in reception a lady came in to ask if she could collect her stuff. She was explaining to the receptionist that she had left the organisation and hadn't had time to collect her belongings. Assuming she may have been one of the very unhappy members of staff who left without notice. Anyways reception refused her entry to the building...,0.99545443,0.004372218,0.00017339585
The process was not as expected as interview felt rushed. The competency questions were  standard but they could have been engaging and welcoming.

Terrible process.  Phone interviewer didn't know anything about me and didn't appear to have read my CV prior.  Various faceless members of the HR contacted me with different information throughout the interview stage.  Assessment was irrelevant and the feed back was a shambles.

"I'm an internal candidate and unfortunately my experience was just as poor as the external reviews posted on this site.  Questions pitched at totally the wrong level and some that were so longwinded they were barely understandable.  Feedback following the interview again echoes the other reviews. The feedback was generic and unhelpful regurgitated straight from some kind of textbook.  The Ombudsman Leader that interviewed me was arrogant and incompetent. Unprepared to deliver the feedback (despite it being over a month after the interview) and totally unable to respond to challenge or probing questions about what the generic feedback actually meant.  Cemented my view that I should never have applied for the job. It's not worth the money  and would mean working for an incompetent ""leader"" with nothing to really show for it.",0.99900085,0.00084822875,0.0001509144
Online application which required supporting letter and 300 word statement as to why I thought I was suitable. Then telephone screening call lasting about 20 minutes.

CV and cover letter with application form followed by telephone interview where I was asked  my reasons for wanting the role and to describe myself in 3 words.  First stage was a 2 hour long competency interview with 35 competency questions per area such as team work making a difficult decision making an unpopular decision etc.  Followed by time case study on a problem with staff where he was exceeding targets but he had a service complaint and his quality was poor. I was asked to draft how I would resolve the complaint and given 15 minutes to do so. I was also given 30 minutes to draft a final decision on a made up scenario of a restaurant  complaining about a defamatory article that had been published in a newspaper.   After an intense day of these 3 aspects I had to wait over 2 weeks for the final stage which was an interview to discuss my answers to the case studies and a 10 minute presentation on the challenges the fos is facing and how I would tackle them as an OM.   The 3 interviewers were all males and of English origin which I felt lacked complete diversity as a young Asian female. One of the interviewers sipped his ice cream drink as the other made up questions on the spot. They were extremely critical of my case study answers even though I had obviously done a great job as hardly anyone was called back apparently for the final stage. I thought this was a good cop bad cop exercise so maintained my professionalism.   Feedback I received was very generic and I was simply advised I didn't make the cut despite a 2 month process time. They tried to brush off the negative glassdoor reviews by claiming they were fake! My most worrying moment was when I arrived to my first stage interview and the receptionists were talking about how adjudicators were crying about the targets they could not meet.   A complete waste of my time. Thankfully I applied elsewhere and have been offered a role. £55K really doesn't seem worth it now I have experienced their total unprofessionalism.,0.99836737,0.0014712898,0.0001613592
Very poor standard of interview. Those that did the interviewing I'd love to see them doing their job. They clearly think they are perfect.  There was nothing in the process to discuss what experience you have and why you'd be good at the role. Based on previous experience and bringing that experience to the role isn't something they explored. Trouble is if you have experience I don't think they care  not interested and that's why they never asked. I think they're looking to see if you're under 29 and excited about everything from buying lollipops to turning up for work.  I would say too that the panel were not the slightest bit organised,0.9972488,0.0025840676,0.00016699739
An online application form  covering letter and CV. Then a phone screening interview (this was billed as something I didn't need to prepare for). The person who interviewed me didn't seem to be aware of my CV and kept asking for recent examples of things I wasn't doing currently. They also told me at the end that I would need to be better at competency based interview questions (I hadn't prepared with those sorts of examples as I was told it was initial screening). I got through to the next stage  assessment centre a one hour complaint case study and a 30 minute performance management case study. Then an hour's interview  mainly competency based but also about motivations for applying etc. Got through to the final stage  a panel interview with an HR rep and 2 Ombudsman leaders. They asked questions in depth about the case studies and I then had to give a presentation  which also led to follow up questions on the presentation. They also blended in a couple of competency questions. I did not get a job offer  disappointingly I didn't get a phone call or email to tell me this but when the deadline they had given me  for hearing the result had passed I logged into the online system and found the result  but nothing beyond a statement saying 'unsuccessful'.,0.997879,0.0019932042,0.00012778863

Make you jump through hoops and long winded process. They take their time in coming back to you and when they do they do not provide feedback when you fail to meet their criteria. They apologise that they are not taking your application forward this time what makes them think you would put yourself through the whole procedure again and apply  for a role again with this organisation.

"It was an awful process and really highlights the reasons for all the negative reviews on here disengaged managers and incompetent HR reps working the process. Sent my cv and covering letter in was contacted a few days later to arrange a ""chat"" with someone from HR about the role and if I was fully interested.  This ""chat"" turned out to be a full formal telephone interview.  The HR rep was taking notes as a was speaking and shouted ""STOP"" down the phone at me several times because she couldnt keep upvery off putting.  How I managed to get through to the next round I do not know .  Stage 2 was slightly better.  2 written exercises1 on performance management and 1 on writing a decision then a 1 on 1 interview.  It was done well with a HR person asking competency based questions. I asked loads of questions on the role which the HR person either said she didnt know or gave me wrong information  Didn't go too bad and got through to the last round.  This was the icing on the cake. 2 Ombudsman leaders and someone from HR interviewed me.  They advised there were no set questions and boy they wearnt wrong.  They plucked questions out of the air at random which didnt make sense.  It was questions that you would only know the answer too if you worked their.  I tried to ask a few questions about the role and one of them laughed in my face and said shouldnt an applicant already know this (I did try but the HR rep didnt know so how the heck should I)I also asked about the reviews on here and again they laughed in my face and said they were all fake. It was like a bullying session in a pub rather than an interview. Rather than leaving there inspired hoping to get a new job I left thinking how can these clowns be dealing with such important decisions.    I didnt get the job and when asked for feedback it was terrible some standardised response of there were better applicants and didnt meet the marks.  My presentation wasnt up to scratch (they actually used that phrase) but they asked a vague question and gave 10 minutes to present on it.  All in all an awful interview process and the reviews on here make me belief there would be more to come if I was successful.",0.99532026,0.004443761,0.00023595034

There were four stages to the process with the initial application was by CV and covering letter. Following this I was invited to take an online timed psychometric style test which was HARD!!! I thought I failed here and called them approximately a week afterwards for 'confirmation' of not getting through only to be surprised by being told I'd scored a very high percentile  candidates had to score within the top 50 percentile and I was told I was in the 80s.   The next stage was a onetoone interview at their offices where I completed a case study and was then asked a series of comptency based questions to be responded to in the STAR format. The interviewer stifled yawns throughout and was losing a battle with his eyelids that wanteed very much to remain closed in sleep. Honestly I wasn't boring I'd foolishly chosen the 2:00pm interview slot and he'd possibly had a very heavy comainducing lunch prior!  I then had to chase them for a follow up to eventually be told that I was not going to be put through to the next and final stage. I had to chase again for almost two weeks to get feedback which was beyond weak. The interviewer said he'd spoken to the senior HR manager for clarification before issuing the feedback to me  I am not sure what clarification was required as it was just he and I in the room [well he was physically there even if not awake throughout]. The feedback was that I had answered a competency question operationally. End of feedback. Told you it was weak. They apparently do not take into consideration the case study unless you are going throough to the final stage which is a panel interview at which you will need to give a presentation.   The whole process from initial application to feedback following the third stage of the process took about 1214 weeks which I thought was very long. I did a lot of the chasing even when I had been successful in going through to the next stage which I thought was a little slack.,0.9977017,0.0021575072,0.00014076692
Pretty wary of interviewing here after reading reviews on glassdoor but decided worth taking a look.  Sadly my experience was pretty negative really simple questions about how would you react in certain situations what's our motto etc. Never discussed the actual job despite having a few rounds and people there would come into the room and ask the same questions their colleagues had just asked.  Compared to other interview processes I was in there was also a real difference in the seniority of people you would meet  all the Ombudsman managers seemed very young/recent graduates.,0.994803,0.0050875023,0.00010944502
The job was initially applied for online. Fairly quick process. You can upload your CV and answer a few quick questions. You then get contacted by a HR representative who will ask a little bit about your current situation; why you are looking for a job if you have any other interviews coming up then tells you a bit about the company and the job you will be doing. If you pass the phone interview you will be asked to come in for a face to face interview in the main office. Prior to you coming in you will be sent a guide about how to prepare yourself for the interview. It will even tell you what questions you should be prepared to answer. Once at the interview you will face your would be line manager and a HR representative. One will quiz you on your experience and ability to do the job the other will focus more on your behaviours and values respectively. If you're successful you will be offered a job via a phone call from the HR representative pending you pass the screening process which is a very long indeed.,0.72128356,0.2775082,0.0012082665

Was asked two technical questions: How is FOS funded  Maximum time for business to reply to a query Was sent a case study to complete after passing that stage. Was told within a day that I had passed. Invited to an interview scheduled 3 weeks later which made this about a month's process in total. Two interviewers who asked pretty standard questions about my CV etc pretty much the same as the telephone interview.

Applied for the role online by writing a cover letter and uploading my CV. Waited several days until I received an email confirmation about a phone interview. After phone interview I had to complete a case study which had to be recalled during the face to face interview. Had to wait 4 weeks for interview however received a phone call few days before interview to say it had to be rearranged and the next one available was another 3 week wait. This process was disappointing and gave a disorganised impression of the company. However face to face interview was very well set up and professional. Phone interview was mainly about my motivation for applying for this role providing examples of great customer service and how I managed my time. During the face to face interview was asked a set of 7 behavioural competency questions consisting of the following themes: Handling a customer problems Knowledge sharing and asking others for help within a team learning from mistakes and question about which value I believed was most important.  TIPS: Memorise the case study briefly however it more important that you are able to evaluate it. Be relaxed and confident when speaking and think your examples through thoroughly it is ok to take a few seconds to think of a good example (even better if you prepare some examples before hand) but always evaluate the motives behind your examplesafter explaining the what and how make sure you say the why use the STAR technique.,0.7637985,0.22860834,0.0075931475

There were three stages;  The first was a telephone interview that lasts about 2030 minutes. The questions were behavioural and competency based and the setting was quite relaxed. I got confirmation at the end of the interview that I have got to the next stage.  The second stage is a case study. I think I was given 45 minutes to complete the case emailed to me but the questions are simple and the answers are very straightforward after reading the documents given to you. I was asked to come to a face to face interview at the London office approximately 4 days after submission of the case study.   The final stage was the face to face Interview with one person from HR and the other was the team manager. The questions are on the case study to make sure you were the one who answered it and also more competency/behavioural questions.

CV Cover letter followed by a telephone interview. If successful you must complete a Case Study after which you may be invited for final interview. The process also involved a lengthy and comprehensive background check which must be completed before the interview stage.

After completing a pretty laid back telephone interview and online case study I was invited to attend a formal interview. The interviewers made me feel welcome and after a brief introduction they asked me a series of STARtechnique questions.

It's extremely tiring and full on. Had little breaks in between activities but it was nerve wracking. The process involved 1:1 interview group task talking to a care experienced person (you have to lead the conversation and get nothing back) written assessment (writing an email about a care) and role play with an actor. They say they're not checking your knowledge of social work but your competencies and you can handle it but that's a lie. They expected to be a social worker with experience during this even though they say you can't have experience to get onto the training. If you haven't done lots of research and practiced don't waste your time. I aced that interview and I was confident in everything I did. You can't show everything on camera and it shouldn't be on you to consider that but them when assessing. Their loss Had to chase them for a response but apparently they contacted me within a week...,0.99628973,0.003520526,0.0001897533

Initial interview was easy however the assessment centre was difficult it went on for around 5 hours with small 10 minute breaks in between with a larger 30 minute break,0.004030462,0.9957231,0.00024637496
I applied online and I got invited to an assessment centre pretty quickly. The online portal is really easy to use and each stage of the application is very clearly laid out and the instructions are easy to follow. When booking onto the assessment centre you get a choice of about 3 days and either the morning or afternoon for each day which I thought was pretty good. The assessment day is online which I like because it means you don’t have to travel – it isn’t as easy to present yourself as you would in a facetoface assessment day though (I hope they take this into account). For the assessment day you have 5 activities to complete. For each activity you get a brief before it starts so you are fully prepared going into it. The activities are an interview group activity written exercise role play and conversation with a care experienced young person. I found the day to go quite quickly but I did think it was laid out very well with plenty of time allocated for breaks or to have 5 minutes to just take a breather. Some of the activities were a lot harder than others. At points it felt as if they expect you to have this full catalogue of knowledge on how to be a social worker and to know exactly what to do and how to react in certain situations. This for me was really offputting because it’s meant to be a 2year scheme where you learn how to respond to these types of situations and how to deal with certain people. I do think that they could – and should – take this into consideration as it has put me off entering this field of work and I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels like this. Interview – 35 minutes and interviewed by a qualified social worker. They were friendly and allowed you time to think about your answer. The questions were pretty standard but be prepared to be asked about a difficult situation you’ve experienced. Group activity – 30 minutes. Given 5 cases and 10 minutes to discuss as a group and say what you would do about them followed by 2 minutes to discuss with the assessors. You then get some additional information and another 10 minutes to discuss as a group followed by another 2minute discussion with the assessors. There needs to be more group discussion time as people can easily talk over others but make sure you do speak up! Written exercise – 25 minutes for the whole task. You have to write a mock email response to a social work brief. Very clear and simple instructions and you get given a lot of background information. Keep an eye on the time as it goes very quickly – I would recommend starting a timer. Role play – 15minute brief followed by 20minute activity. Very difficult. You take on the role of a newly qualified social worker having a meeting with someone played by an actor. This was a very challenging activity and you’re thrown in at the deep end and the actor gets very into their role and came across as harsh and rude. I appreciate that you do have to deal with people like this in this job but it was a lot for someone who was on an assessment day. I didn’t feel as though the assessors were as sympathetic as they could be as they could clearly see I was out of my element. Conversation with a care experienced young person. You have a 5minute conversation where you’re completely in the lead. This is difficult as they don’t give you anything at all and it gets pretty awkward. Then they ask you questions for 5 minutes about why you want to be a social worker and your motivation for applying. Overall the assessment centre ran very smoothly and was laid out in a very good way but I do think that they need to take into consideration that the people applying are not social workers and may not have a lot of knowledge on how to deal with certain types of people or behaviours. I also feel that the assessors could have been a bit more emphatic they didn’t really offer any friendly smiles and came across a bit cold at times.,0.07879922,0.9126437,0.008557103

I was interviewed by a panel of 3 staff members  2 operational and 1 from HR. I answered a series of questions and there was no task involved.   Although 2/3 staff were professional polite and I found quite easy to speak with. One staff member who I also liaised with over email made me feel quite uncomfortable and actually laughed at a response I gave as I don't think I fully answered the question the way that they wanted. I felt quite taken aback as this has never happened to me during an interview before and I was upset as I had also spent a lot of time preparing for the interview. Ultimately even if I am not the right candidate I deserve to not be laughed at during an interview. It brought about an uncomfortable atmosphere I think even for the two other staff members present.,0.98373914,0.015963329,0.00029756108

The application and video interviews were standard and okay however when I did the assessment centre it was one of the most difficult and overwhelming things I’ve had to do. It was a very long process 8:15 till about 1. Most of the activities finished early so you were sat at your laptop waiting for the next. I felt like the group task everyone was just trying to talk over each other to get their point through.  At the end the day I had to do a role play exercise with an actress pretending to be a family member and a social worker now this was the worst experience of the day. They give you time to prep but nothing can prepare you for this I had an actress that was literally acting as if she was in a Hollywood film how they expect you to deal with someone who’s literally shouting at you when you’ve never been a social worker before I have no clue. The actor talked over me raised her voice and obviously I understand that as a social worker you may encounter people like this however this is an interview and I was unable to come across in a way that I wanted due to the way the actress was behaving.  It was honestly so overwhelming I was almost in shock. I can’t even imagine what it would have been like if it was in person so thank god it was virtual. Overall it was a long and overwhelming day they expect you to literally already be a social worker and therefore it’s very difficult.,0.99797744,0.0018734538,0.00014901446

They sent the interview questions a few days in advance and essentially stuck to them in that same order with a few probing questions here or there.  The team was lovely and created a pleasant interviewing environment However I do agree with one of the other reviews on here which suggested the company probed them for ideas at the interview only to reject them. They did ask a fair few questions about the company specifically what they could improve on how they could do it and other companies that I could point to as a reference. While these may have been innocent questions to determine how well I could contribute to the company they could have made those questions more hypothetical. As they were it did feel like I spent 20 minutes giving them ideas for free and with no guarantee of a job offer.,0.0056650704,0.99347794,0.0008569384

The interview took 4 hours... I applied online and talked to a lovely women. The people at green peace are not so kind as they kept focusing on how much money you will be bringing in this role. After 2 hours I was bored and hungry then we came in for another 2 hours of questioning it was like a police interrogation . The whole experience has put me off Greenpeace. I recently got another charity job and I mentioned this interview to them and some of the staff at Greenpeace who come to them tell them of the terrible work hours and financial pressure if you don't meet quotas. The worst bit was at the end when they split us up in two groups those who got it and those who didn't which was really embarrasing and dehumanising for all our wasted effort. The whole experience was unethical and unmoral.,0.99840635,0.0013853494,0.00020834248
"Approximately 30 minute interview. Involved a short presentation followed by about 10 interview questions.

They also specified a different time length for the presentation than what was mentioned in the invitation email.",0.001074411,0.9987087,0.0002169606
I got the idea from my experience that they weren't too interesting in looking for people that genuinely care about the environment they are looking solely for people with perfect sales skills regardless of your passion. The interview was ok there were 4 of us and they let us speak separately there wasn't any pressure to speak first or when called upon which was nice.  It's really important that you read the document they give you as they do ask you questions on it and give you little time to prepare for the roleplay. You have to nail this.  They asked competency based questions and look for your confidence. After the questions we had to go away for a couple of hours come back and then have a practice run of door canvassing you had to be perfect first time with no hesitation.

The interview was fairly relaxed and almost exclusively consisted of questions related directly to the job rather than more general questions. The hiring process however was very badly handled. I am writing this 4 weeks after the interview and I still have not had any communication from greenpeace at all since the interview. I was told that they were only interviewing a small number of candidates and that I should hear within a week. After two weeks I emailed to ask if a decision had been made and after receiving no response to this I followed up again a week later and still did not receive a response.

Telephone interview face to face interview one week later. The telephone interview followed an initial check on your background and then questions from a checklist of questions that were supplied previously. There was a calm and reassuring approach and plenty of time to answer questions. The formal interview was with a panel of 3 and an observer from Change Agents. I was given a topic previously to present and suggest some actions if I was successful in securing the job which I was asked to deliver initially. I was also given a list of questions to be asked 15 minutes before the interview and provided a quiet area to look at these.

Poor and rushed. Senior Manager and his Executive Assistant kept interpreting me while I was answering questions  let candidates answer the question.

Initial interview was good. Friendly approach with no preparation required. Felt like a standard technical Q&A style.

I was asked to join an in person interview. The team was very understanding of availability. The Interview took place in Glasgow to the Marie Curie Hospice and it required to wear masks which cause some difficulties at least for me. Few days after the interview I received a call and a voice message thinking it would be a positive feedback or at least a good one even if negative. I had been asked to call back I did and then I received an email with the rejection and shortly put that I did perform well at the interview and I was not selected. I asked for further feedback and I never heard back. As I understand it is a competitive and busy environment this is no way to treat a candidate who spent money to travel for an in person interview.

The second the virtual interview started I already knew I didn’t get the job. The first thing they did was take a photo of me with hardly an explanation behind it I thought this was very bizarre and I felt immediately awkward. Neither interviewer displayed any particular interest in getting to know me during the 20 mins interview (far too short a time if you ask me) the questions were very basic but they didn’t even ask me for my notice period or salary expectations to align me properly to the job. A big clue they weren’t interested. For a 20 minute interview I feel I should have been telephone screened prior to the first stage interview so they at least had my basic info. I was barely given an opportunity to ask questions  it seemed that both interviewers were keen to leave and/or forgot to let me ask questions. I just about squeezed one in at the end and due to the answer given to me I already knew I wasn’t successful during the interview. The interviewer answered my question in a way that implied I will not get to work with Marie Curie first hand. After chasing up on the outcome (I already knew I didn’t get it  but it’s the principal) my feedback was a pretty cold standardised email with no personal touch “we have decided to progress with other candidates with skills that better align with the role”... in which case I don’t understand why I was shortlisted if it’s a case of skill set which my CV outlines. I would have preferred honest in depth feedback given the time I put in to researching and preparing for an interview. I didn’t have a good experience as a candidate which is a shame as I admire this charity. I’m really put off applying for future roles here.,0.9975284,0.0022999276,0.00017169169

Upon arriving at reception I met a manager and team leader who took me into an interview room. First part of the process was 15 generic questions and second part was a telephone role play. The interviewers did not seem interested in the process and it seemed to me that they already had the candidates selected for the role. The disappointing part for me was that during that interview I was told they would be in contact with the result within two days and I could have detailed feedback from the interview. I did not hear back from the interview for nine days and had to contact the recruitment team myself to find the result. I was also not given any feedback and sent the result from an email stating to not reply back. The whole experience was very disappointing and unprofessional.

"I applied for a temporary administrator to work at the head office in London in November 2018. I  submitted my CV via a recruitment agency and got an interview. The process took 5 days.   I arrived on time for the interview the receptionist contacted the interviewers but they arrived over 20 minutes later.  I attended an interview  which was about 20 minutes. Was interviewed by two coordinators.   I walked through the head office floor to a room. One thing that was striking was how not diverse the London Head office is  very white dominated.   The interview was very informal but I could tell the interviewers was very illprepared. The interviewers really struggled to ask relevant questions for the job. One of the interviewers kept trying to work out what to ask me. ""Erm what should I ask you next erm""  So to avoid the sheer awkwardness of being interviewed by people that did not know what to ask  I asked a few questions about the job.

Unpleasant experience. Had to take part in two panel interviews straight after each other and also complete a timed admin exercise all for a parttime administration job. Very time consuming and ended up getting extremely negative and discouraging feedback one point of which was that my internet kept breaking up (it was a Zoom interview or something similar). Not sure how this is productive given I have no control over my internet as it is an issue with my location. Overall negative experience I ended up getting an administrative job the following week with a different company who obviously didn't find the same micro flaws in my interview as this company did.,0.9988417,0.0010151131,0.00014326806

Know your controllermodelview adding data to your database etc. Ensure you know how to use your github too (It's obvious but just incase) . Overall it's not hard just go over your rails and you should be good.  The con is after the interview no feedback is provided which I think leaves a bad impression on the company regardless how nice they are at each stage. Considering the time you spent preparing and all the effort that goes into applying for a job. I think it would be really nice if companies spared at least 5minutes to explain why a candidate isn't selected especially if you keep saying you 'really enjoyed this interview' at the end of it.

There were ackward moments like on the way to the interview room. I tried to engage in small talk just to make it more naturally but did not get anything back.  The experience I will be taking away from this company is that the interviewer (who is the brand of the organiser) appearing cold and unapproachable .

I applied for the role online quite a while later I get a text message to check my emails and when I did it said I have been shortlisted for an interview. I had to book in a slot which I did and then attended an interview at their head office in Birmingham a week later. I signed in at reception waited for a while and as I was earlier than expected I was taken through to their busy office on the ground floor where people were chatting away amongst themselves and some of the women looked like they had lost the will to live. I was then given a few pieces of paper a calculator and a scenario which I had 20 minutes to complete with all that noise going on around me.  Once completed I was taken upstairs for an interview where 2 people interviewed me they asked me many questions and as I have worked in this field before I was able to give real examples and had some knowledge of what they do which seemed to have impressed them a little judging by the looks on their faces. I was then asked all the usual cliche questions that you get asked in interviews followed by an opportunity to ask some of my own questions the bombshell was then dropped on me that its actually a part time role of 20 hours per week which to be totally honest is nowhere near enough hours to live and its cover for maternity until November 2018. What sickened me the most is that about roughly 7 people have had an interview for the one job which wasn't told to me until I got to the interview the bloke from HR should have told me this and I wouldn't have bothered turning up. I gave a very good interview and its shocking that I didn't get the job but then again when there is only one job going its clear which ethnicity usually gets it.,0.99015325,0.0094961375,0.00035050718
"Around 1.5 hours long process consisting of 3 elements; role play scenario preparing and presenting information based on the role play and finally a panel interview.

An hour spent being given the background on the company the current set up the challenges the new managers were having in building a team and selling the role (not a good sign) challenging me about my cv and gaps which are for valid reasons before my presentation then another hour on vaguely competence based questions. This was not a competence based interview in my view.  Absolutely no concern whatsoever for people who may have had childcare caring or travel commitments keeping candidates there for two hours whilst they endlessly chatted. I had to stop the interview as I had a return train booked and it was a Friday afternoon. This did not give me a good indication that I could count on these people to safeguard my health and welfare.  No adjustments made to the interview process despite me declaring a disability.  Extremely concerned at how much the managers discussed being fairly new in post and how they were working with people from other places they had worked at it felt like I would be joining an old boys network of people who had brought their friends along. One of the panel discussed mainly his own issues which had nothing to do with why I was at interview. I also did not feel that he valued or could adjust to a culture of flexible working which I stated was important for me. I got the feel that diversity was paid lip service to and they were uncomfortable at questions I asked regarding the diversity mix within the team.  I was told that feedback would be given the following week. It wasn't. I had to email their contact centre to get any response at all. I am still awaiting detailed feedback which I requested a week ago and did not get the job despite being told I would go down well working there.,0.9982297,0.0016079695,0.00016227638

It was a two stage interview process. The first was a phone interview which was more like an informal chat. I think this is to see what your personality is like. The second stage is an assessment split into 3 steps. Step 1 was a role play as if you were accepting a call from a customer.

Brilliant interaction with the recruitment agent to reach interview stage. Company moves quickly to hire. 90 minute interview to discuss a task provided in advance. 2person panel interview. UX Manager (UXM) and Content Marketing manager (CMM). Role reports to CMM despite being a UXspecific role. Interview went pearshaped with CMM. While explaining my work I used the term 'grandma test' widely used to refer to the userfriendliness of interfaces. CMM instantly accuses me of being ageist and sexist. UXM speaks up on my behalf saying it is a recognised test. I knew the role was gone at this point but also defended myself and the test name. Should have stopped the interview and requested an apology because of the interviewer's ignorance. Yes BSW you were ignorant.

The process consisted of a phone interview a most likely/least likely selection test a video interview and had to attend the office where it was the final stage interview.

Impression given would put any potential employee off with strict details about no holidays being allowed for first few weeks until probation is passed or your let go.  Passed all tests but wasn't offered the job due to not being able to answer one question in more depth which my agency thought was absolutely silly to decline me on this one thing but im happy it was a huge relief as I personally couldn't work in a place where no one wants to have a normal friendly conversation & its all rules rules not allowed this that is the impression i got very closed no interaction.If I was offered job I would have declined it in end.,0.9867943,0.012670247,0.0005354702

My card was marked as soon as I spoke with a 'coach' about noticing her park in a disabled space at the front of the building then subsequently speaking with her during the role play exercises...hmmmm Sorry but if that's how you react I wouldn't want to work with you on any team including the one I'm currently managing! The other staff were really friendly and helpful but I questioned if they were volunteers or pressganged.  The callcentre atmosphere seemed one of passive controlling and it was unsettling to experience. I think I would be scared to leave my desk to pee! Staff there reminded me of the folk in the  fairy tale of the Kings New Clothes where everyone pretends all is ok but are too scared or intimidated to say otherwise.Well I was the boy who called out!  It would appear anyone with personality your own mindset opinion. common sense approach or who aren't afraid to challenge are unwelcome. Yes I totally agree to show sympathy and empathy with customers but let's not patronise people with falseness pet empower them to do some things themselves.     Seriously I'm not bitter and twisted nor is this sour grapes far from it!I am currently employed in a good job but I was prepared to almost HALVE my current salary to work at Motabilty Operations particularly after having read the positive blurb on their website I was really impressed.Prior to assessment day I had not seen many of the reviews on this site however having read these reviews since my interview I can clearly see where the negatives are coming from. The coaches and senior managers need to take note of the negative reviews on here and CHANGE! However it's obvious that there's a cult like status at this place and I doubt anyone will be brave enough to actually do something to change this!  However I left the day feeling uneasy at what I saw with my own eyes and the impression of workers being micromanaged every minute of the day and almost scared to express any opinion.,0.7193031,0.27993104,0.00076587114
Phone call with scenario based question which was sent via email a few moments before.  Got through to the assessment centre.  There was a group of maybe 18 of us we were greeted by all the assessors (maybe 810 of them). We were taken to a room and given a quick presentation. The presentation focused heavily on Motabilty's expectations. I felt they focused on their inflexible procedures for sickness absence lateness shift patterns and parking far more than needed and left me feeling quite intimidated.  We were split into 3 groups. One had a tour and test of ability to use their computer system (I think it was called Alpha) the second did 2 group exercises (1. decide on who will be the next ambassador and 2.  Decide if someone should fail or pass their probation) the third was taken to do mock calls on the phone using their system 'Ask Mo' to answer the scenarios that were presented.   The day was ran very smoothly and was well organised. But I felt that it was a real 'show' and reading between the lines not one person said how nice it was to work there that they enjoyed it or really anything at all that made me want to work there.  I was told they need to recruit 40 people before Nov as they have a real problem with people failing their probation. If I am honest it felt as though the assessment day is designed to make you fail.  I didn't get the position (which I was relieved about). The feedback was that I didn't ask enough questions on the mock assessment. I believe this would be an unfair reason to not give someone a job as their 'Ask Mo' system did not prompt you with which questions to ask. And certainly with maybe half a day of practice would be something an individual could work on or improve. It is an unrealistic to expect candidates to know exactly which questions to ask with no training or prior experience. I did resolve the clients issues in all 3 scenarios.   There was a feedback form at the end which you are asked to put your name on.  I think it would be incredibly difficult for a prospective employee to write honestly about their experience on the day for fear of it interfering with their chances of getting the position.  They asked everyone if they have any questions at the end. I did not feel that I could  ask the questions I wanted to because they weren't relevant to everyone. There was no actual interview other than a couple of questions over the phone right at the beginning as part of their screening.  Honestly the worst interview process I have ever been through and wouldn't wish it upon anyone else hence why I am writing this review.  I felt like I was on a conveyor belt having scripted conversations.  If you want this job prepare make sure you know their policies and expectations and practice mock scenarios.   My comment to management:  I can understand you want to set clear expectations from the start but I would suggest keeping the details of policies such as how many minutes you can be late and how many sick days you are 'allowed' per year are conversations to be had with employees who have performance issues and not to be had with prospective employees especially when that potential employee is the most diligent hard working reliable and conscientious employee you will never have the pleasure of working with.,0.9968927,0.0029229121,0.00018427026
First there was a phone interview. Then I had an assessment at the main offices. There were about 15 of us altogether. We had 3 role plays on the phone a look around the building and last bit of the assessment we as a team had to decide wether we thought someone should pass  their probation. If you managed to pass the assessment you then get another phone interview.  Which I did not pass. The money is great and their are good Benifit’s but I get the feeling you have to jump through hoops for the pleasure.   Beware if you do get the job there is 6 weeks training if you are not up to scratch after the first 3 weeks you will not proceed on.,0.4161528,0.5817385,0.0021087802
Long  3 hrs long!  I had a first interview with the agency. There were some questions about my CV why I want to work for the organisation and some competency based questions.  So then i was invited for an actual interview and we were 7 people.  So they showed us around and it started with  a roleplay over the phone.  I am normally very good at these  but these were the hardest roleplays i have ever done in my life. They use system called ASK MO.  so first example was policy holder called to ask to add a driver and you have to use this system to advise them can you do that and what happens with no prep! I struggled to find this information so i failed all 3 roleplays and i got fustrated as i couldnt find the information i was looking for. the feedback i received after was that i am very process orrientated  well i just wanted to tell them the correct information and not blag it.  after that was a group exercise and then was competency based questions. fairly easy stuff.  Everyone was very nice and the company looked like a lovely place.,0.9541958,0.044194143,0.0016101062
Thanks.. For not offering me the job.  It seems I had a narrow and very great escape.  The interview process was probably the worst experience I've ever had the misfortune to have done.  It started with a telephone interview with the agency which was fine.   The company spent more time showing off their building than focusing on who they were employing.  A huge amount of candidates turned up all together to be shown around then individual interviews.  Only to be invited back for more rigorous testing.  After all the effort and time consuming meetings I was given the most flimsy and feeble reason as to why I was not to be offered the job.      People are attracted to the better pay and office.  But don't forget you have to also work with these draconian devils. Money is not everything and thanks for the warnings that this place is not for me.

Application form which included a few long answer questions as well as your CV. After this you are invited to a telephone interview and after this an assessment centre.  Although my interviewer was great and the process was fairly straight forward Motability Operations do not offer any feedback upon rejection 'due to the high volume of applicants'.. I found this disappointing as many huge organisations will not provide feedback if you don't make the telephone interview but will provide feedback if you are rejected after the telephone or group interview. I think that this is something that Motability Operations should look at as an applicant has taken the time to attend the telephone interview and undertaken a lot of research so even if it was just a few lines of feedback this would be very much appreciated.,0.99423176,0.005433653,0.00033457586

They ask a little bit about why you want the job and ask scenario questions to see how you would react to assess how suited you are to the job. I found a lot of the questions were common sense things however as a psychologist and someone who works well with children that may just be my opinion rather than a generalized view. The interview was very laid back it was in a professional setting but I was made to feel very comfortable which may be partially why I found the interview provoked little stress.

Funny how my first experience got taken down NCS did not like the reality of what I said I am assuming. I applied for the fast track scheme in around May they took 3 weeks to get back to me considering I wasted time doing a video interview and trying to get my application checked out soon as possible.  Waste of time and a poor unprofessional company. They should have the decency to actually  fast track your application if they state they can.

Online application and then group interview  4 hours with around 12 in the group. I was sent a pre assessment task before the interview which was to prepare a staff briefing. They were very strict on time as each person had only 3 minutes  they cut you off after this. I had a task involving a set of tasks that I had to prioritise with the assessors throwing in curveballs every so often.,0.99792284,0.0019263752,0.00015089163
I first applied for the Pastoral Leadership role. The Interview process consisted of an online registration with question asking to outline experience and motivation for role.

After applying online and being invited to an assessment day we were told to prepare a 3 minute presentation and warmup activity. The process was 4 hours long and we did lots of group activities. It was a lot of expect and should have been a training day rather than an interview process.   The day itself was positive but my issue was with the fact that we weren't given the courtesy of having a personal response or at least an indication of a typical shortcoming after giving so much time and effort. My annoyance stems from the fact they told us there was a place for everyone there. I thought almost everyone was suitable except maybe one person who gave incorrect information on vocal warmups and the components of a narrative.   I left feeling like I had done a good job and was proud that I had been myself connected with other team mates and was confident in each task I carried out. After finding out I wasn't successful I felt judged on my personality rather than my ability to do the job well. It seems that they are looking for particular characteristics so if you are loud outgoing and extrovert this is probably for you.   If you have years of relevant experience but are quieter or more introvert then this is probably not what they're looking for and as others pointed out afterwards it probably wouldn't be a place I would be happy in if that is the only type of person they value in this position.,0.989764,0.009826644,0.00040946048

This is  a group interview initially there are around 30 people and they are divided into groups of around 810. In your group you first start with your ice breaker which you will have to conduct. After the ice breaker you need to say why you want to work for NCS with a 2 minute time limit. This interview lasts a whooping 4 hours and this takes around an hour for everyone to do. After that they make you act out scenarios between mentors and children in groups of two which is fairly easy as you get to discuss this with your partner and normally everyone is really nice. After this they give you a campaign to present to everyone in the group and this normally shows your team work skills so make sure to engage with the team and ask the person who's speaking the least their opinions.

Had two interviews with Nesta. Process took a few weeks received an interview invitation relatively straight away.  Panel interview made up of Programme Manager and previous Team Coordinator who seemed nice. Interview comprised of two activities and questions were compentencybased. However I felt at one point one of the panel members was trying to put me off where they commented the environment and nature of the organisation is a lot different to my previous experience. Which is ironic as that person had a similar background.   In another interview it seems like the panel members were trying to catch me out where they asked me questions I would not have identified from the JD. One of the panel member also made a disparaging comment when I told them what area I was coming in from...as much as the organisation seems like they are actively working to remove bias in the recruitment process when you go to the office I found 98% of people there to be white!

I discovered that it is not always quick and easy to get hired. The job interview process can be lengthy. Being interviewed once and getting a job offer is typically a thing of the past.

I arrived early but still had to wait almost an hour after the agreed time for the interview to take place.

First interview required that I plan and prepare a group targeted at children and their families in a family hub in line with the Early Years Foundation Stage.   Spent hours on the task only not to be asked very much about it at all.   3 panel interview and questions based around Better Start Safeguarding and what I could bring to the role.  Feedback was patronising and impersonal (felt like they were reading from a script).  job advertised as permanent yet Better  Start funding runs out in 2025.

Very organised process with excellent preparation provided to candidates  questions provided in advance assessment given in plenty of time etc. However the interview itself was incredibly disheartening. I was obviously the last candidate being seen over two days and all panellists looked exhausted and disengaged throughout. Very little feedback (visual or verbal) given or conversation offered no enthusiasm or smiles and seemed like a tickbox exercise. I felt myself racing through my answers and presentation which I'd spent a week preparing as I was anxious everyone wanted to get off the call and I wasn't being considered seriously. Feedback following the interview was generic and did not reference my skills or experience. Very disappointing for such a wonderful organisation I was very excited to interview for.,0.9958121,0.003506838,0.0006809925

Post interview communication was very helpful informing me of the reasons why I was not successful.,0.004313226,0.9829228,0.012763911
long and tedious not well setout.

Standard interview had to submit a preprepared written task did a short role play with a major donor which was unprepared then interview questions.

First I was asked to create an activity with a given example situation. This took half an hour. Then I was taken to an interview room with two others who were seniors in the Children's Services team. They were polite to start off with. I had to present my activity and explain why I had chosen it. Then I was asked questions about my current job and how my work experiences make my suitable for the position. I did get treated quite rudely about how I have taught about FGM despite being a white welsh woman which was very uncomfortable and made the rest of the interview very uncomfortable. This stage took about 1 hour.  Then I moved on to another interview room with 4 people currently in the role to do a Values based interview where they ask questions to decide if you have the same values as the company.

I found the interview process to be very enjoyable and was always made to feel very comfortable. It took a few weeks to hear anything after I had applied for the role. But once I had confirmation of an interview I received constant emails with regards to my appointment and what was needed on the day. The interviewers were very friendly and made me feel at ease throughout the whole interview.   At the end of the interview I was told that they were wanting to move forward quickly with the recruitment process and were hoping to give feedback by the end of the week. It has now been nearly 2 months and I still haven't received any feedback whatsoever. I emailed both who interviewed me at least twice and on both occasions received an out of office reply.   I think it is appalling that an organisation such as the NSPCC who talk of communication welfare and wellbeing as it's core values think it is ok to just ignore someone at the drop of a hat and feel that it is ok to not have the courtesy to pick up the phone or send an email to say whether you have been successful or not. A lot of effort is made to attend an interview; time off work money for train tickets and the underground time out of your day and I believe common courtesy should be returned with effective communication.   I am very disappointed in this outcome and I can't help but feel that if an occasion arose in the future to work there I would decline any offer because of how this all played out.,0.976238,0.020606821,0.0031552

It all seemed  unorganised especially as I was informed in the email that I would have to complete an Email Exercise as part of the process but wasn't given any such task to do.

First I spoke on the phone to the recruiter. After a week she notified me that I was accepted for the interview. I chose the day and time for the interview from the offers.

The interview process was extremely professional. I got all pre interview information on time and the actual interview was conducted with decorum. The members of the panel gave me sufficient time to provide answers which i supported with examples and they asked numerous followup questions. This made it engaging and purposeful. At the end of the interview i was given an opportunity to ask questions and was also given information on next steps. I also thought the interview process itself was very fair. The panel reflected the society in which we live and i valued this very much. It made it the right choice for me.,0.00046771974,0.0020350106,0.99749726

Submission of CV and Covering Letter. After shorlisting traditional panel based interview and written test. The experience was very poor.

"Shortlisted applicants were asked to attend an interview (online due to COVID) and prepare a presentation about a given topic.   The interview was reasonable and the panel explained the next steps of the process clearly saying that they'd communicate their decision in the beginning of the following week. Unfortunately that wasn't the case instead they told me two weeks later and after several followup emails from my side. They didn't apologise for the delay nor they explained the reasons why which I found unprofessional and disrespectful of my time.    Finally the HR person told me I didn't get the job via what was obviously an email template (ie ""we won't be progressing with your application further"") and no specific feedback. In my experience I've always received feedback on the interview and/or task when I got to the final stage.

The whole process has been three months from applying interviewing and then never hearing back. Interview: 30 min test to be presented during the interview.

Email draft  writing to a contractor who hasn't submitted his work for a while) remotely for an hour before the interview.  The interview was with a panel of 3  line manager to be a senior manager who'd work closely with a selected candidate and a programme manager who will be your colleague in the same team.  They all seemed nice and it was quite average  competency based questions tell us about your experience what skills do you have to do this all based on the job description.  No challenging or provoking questions. They also went through my CV and asked  me to explain further about some relevant experience.  Something I found a bit odd was that during the interview the programme manager who could be your colleague in the same team asked me my current salary & salary requirement for the role. That could be quite awkward for your colleague in the same role as you in the same team to know your salary.

2 stage interview process. One with 2 x managers and one with 2 x senior leaders. Was fairly straightforward with quite basic questions. Made to feel relaxed throughout both interviews. The banding for this role was advertised between £25k£35 with potential up to £40k. When offered the job it was to my horror despite disclosing my salary expectations that HR offered me £30k. I have to be honest I was prepared to take a step back in my career and I would be doubtful there was any more experienced candidates than myself. I was then offered £32k which was still less than my current salary. All in all a shocking experience. Why advertise a banding if you ain't prepared to max it for standout candidates (something I was described as during the interview process).,0.8689865,0.13021179,0.00080176455
Interviewed during an assessment centre in August then was telephoned about 3 weeks later despite being told at the interview I would be called within a week to be told I had really impressed everyone who’d met me but that due to a change in the way a contract was performing they had no position to offer me but would be in touch within a couple of months when this changed to offer me a job.  Then about 3 months later the role was being advertised again so I contacted the recruiter who had called me to ask if I was still being considered for the role but was ignored. I then applied again for the role to be turned down due to the calibre of applicant!

I applied online with a cv and covered the person spec and I thought I was applying to the company directly so I was very surprised to get a call from Reed saying that I would be offered an interview  it would have been helpful to have known from the onset that a recruiter was involved so it seemed a bit random getting the call. The recruiter was in touch a lot seeing I was ok for the interview and making sure everything would go smoothly.  The interview was a 2 person panel they seemed friendly enough and I answered the questions to my best ability and thought I gave an ok enough interview  so am not sure quite what they were looking for.  Anyway one week later NO response. Its usually quite quick if a recruiter is involved...by now it had been 2 weeks and I'm thinking well I probably definitely haven't got the job but nevertheless its courtesy to respond back to the interviewee so I phoned the recruiter and emailed  no response. I emailed and called again a few days later  no response. By now I was seething as it showed a complete lack of respect towards me with Reed just ghosting me. So I thought I may as well contact the company directly  as I had the interviewers details on the Teams invite and explained that I had not heard back from the recruiter and if they could help at all.  Cue the next morning 2 missed calls from the recruiter and an email saying I had been unsuccessful and if I wanted feedback etc etc.  I have had such a negative experience and it was all because of the recruiter putting the company in a bad light  however its their call if they want to use a recruiter who doesn't get back to candidates and then ignores them.,0.99223304,0.0075931344,0.00017382835

Started with a CV and Cover letter upload on their website; then online psychometric tests followed by an group assessment day. Whole process took about a month after the deadline closed.  Online psychometric test was a timed task started with two touch typing tasks then a mix of maths english and visual patterns lasting about 50 minutes in total. Heard back the following week to attend assessment day at their HQ in London.  The assessment day was from 11.30am 4pm; there was only 4 candidates being interviewed and only one position in preconstruction management available. There was five tasks during the day and a short lunch where you could meet previous graduates and management.  The first task was a group task to build the tallest possible structure out of provided materials (paper sellotape marshmallows sticks etc.) to a budget. This was focusing on how you work in a team and solve a problem; each candidate had a member of management watching how they interacted so try and contribute during this and assist others they are looking for team players not so much leaders!  There was 11 interviews with management very basic questions asked including why this company? why this scheme? biggest achievement? biggest disappointment? where do you want to be in 5 years? what can you tell us about yourself we can't get from your CV?  There was two data analysis tasks we were rotated around one was to analyse company reports and suggest improvements; the other was mock emails you had to prioritise the tasks and halfway through you were given more to reprioristise a mixture of tasks including calculating costs analysing technical drawings for mistakes and customer complaints.  There was also a negotiation task with a manager who goes very method as a building contractor.. so be prepared.. to negotiate on behalf of the company an overrun build. The focus is on lowering the cost and keeping to an agreed time frame so researching average build costs and schedules would help with this.  Overall its an enjoyable process management is really friendly and encouraging making it a relaxed atmosphere. It is very competitive and being prepared with knowledge of the company is essential. This scheme is not a rotational one so you will only be working in the sector you applied for which is worth considering for future career progression.,0.9958615,0.003445327,0.0006931865

I later heard that I had been unsuccessful in getting the job as another candidate had better experience  strange as I was only asked one question regarding my previous experience so they actually found out very little about it.,0.997698,0.0021778618,0.00012415036

The job advertisement stated it was a very flexible role I  was contacted for an interview. I thought this would be ideal so I could give my skills & time based around other commitments.  The interview was not arranged locally I would of assumed that due to it being a voluntary role the interviewees costs would of been kept minimal with paying for fuel & parking also.  The interviewers  was friendly chilled & they seemed keen until I discovered  the hours are not flexible.  It was suggested that I move my full time  job hours around to fit within this role. There has been no communication since I’m more disappointed with a voluntary brand of treating people this way. No even a ‘ thank you for your time’,0.9906612,0.0089661395,0.00037274088
A well prepared and thorough interview.  The three panel members knew what they were doing.  I felt that I was given a fair chance to show my skills and experiences. Unfortunately all that goodwill was destroyed when they forgot to tell me what the outcome was.  After a month I emailed them to ask for feedback.  I was initially told that the process had taken a lot longer than expected.  But when I asked for clarification it turned out that they'd simply forgotten to tell me that I'd been rejected.  So they lied to me at least initially.   Mistakes happen but that left me completely high and dry.  Very poor from this well known organisation from whom I expected much much better,0.9968612,0.0028962463,0.00024254713

Applied online on Oxfam Website. Emailed me invite to interview. Invited to log in to secure jobs website and select suitable time from those available. Very interesting that on arrival they provided me with the list of interview questions and gave me 10 minutes preparation time before going in to interview. Great idea.

Later I had a panel interview using skype with three professionals from Oxfam team. I had to address a practical issue regarding a hypothetical project. but I had time to prepare a reasonably detailed presentation.

The interviewer was late but apologised which was fine. I was interviewed by two females in the department. They both took turns in answering questions that were mostly competency based. I was then led upstairs for a short communications test which was a little odd to be honest. I was tasked with writing back to an email and responding to tweets (both fine) and then I received two phone calls the first one consisted of information that I already had from the previous email task (fine  easy) but then the second call was about a Charity Walk to which the information was not readily available; in fact I think they may have not put the information in front of me by accident as I was rummaging around on the table to the side of me under a pile of paper (whilst on the phone) I found the information I needed  but to be honest I have a suspicion that they were actually supposed to leave the leaflet out for me!  Regardless I then had another interview with two other members of staff in the department who were nice enough.

"I called on Monday. I had no answer but a wonderful woman called me back and I had an amazing conversation with her ! She was very nice and friendly she talked with me about anything not only work. She also appointed me for an interview just two days later.  After the call she sent me a message and an email with the details about the location and something to watch about Oxfam. I really appreciated all of that. On the day of the interview she sent me a reminder and a ""good luck"".  I arrived at the coffe shop where I had to meet with the girl that was going to take my interview. I was with another guy. Everything was very informal and  we talked about different topics and we got some informations about the job. I didn't really have a great chance to talk since the other guy and the staff girl were actually having their own conversation. But I didn't feel unconfortable at all. I enjoyed anyway. After some minutes she gave us two wood sticks (the ones that they give you for the coffee) and she told us to stop people on the street and exchange them. We wolked a little and she told us to stay in two different places while she was walking up and down the street to see how we were doing. Actually she was more concentrated on the phone. I didn't appreciate that but I continued doing my ""job"". After a while she came and asked me how I was doing and if I exchanged the stick. I was so caught by the conversations with those that I stopped that I forgot about the stick. However she didn't seem to be very disappointed about it. Then she told me that I was doing a great job there but I was not the person she wanted. She said that she was looking for someone to be more interested in charity. Then we shaked hands and that was all. I was really disappointed after that interview....I really wanted that job ! I really wanted to work for charity. I did volunteering in the past and I always got involved in campaigns and donations...but it seems that I didn't actually match the right type of fundraiser she was looking for. Anyway the interview started at 11:00 AM and at 12:21 I already was on the train.  I don't have anything against Oxfam and UrbanLeaf really appreciate what they do. I just didn't enjoy the interview.

I was sent to the office in London and did a group interview. All candidates were asked to interview each other.

Before the interview I was sent a 45minute task to do. This task was all about interpreting data relating to call volumes wrap times and KPIs on the helpline. The focus of this task was something of a surprise as the job description had not mentioned numerical targets or data analysis although I am familiar with these. The task was lengthy for the time allocated.   I was interviewed via Google Hangouts by a panel of three.  The questions were lengthy and I think they all involved multiple parts preceded by the panel reading out statements about Parkinson's UK. I found it difficult to focus my answers while trying to remember the different aspects of each question.   The panel members were otherwise friendly and professional.  Six days after being interviewed I got a systemgenerated email saying no job offer was being made.,0.99743843,0.0024172,0.00014434669

I found the process positive and despite not being offered the role it left me with a very good impression of Parkinson's UK. The HR team were friendly and accommodating throughout and I received some very useful feedback.  The online application process was straightforward. I was not able to make the initial interview time but they made an effort to offer an alternative slot.  The interview process involved meeting the head of team an interview with competency questions and lastly a 10 minute presentation with Q&A. I enjoyed the three stage process. Meeting the head of team at the outset helped put me at ease and enabled me to find out a bit more about the role.  I also got to meet a number of team members so it felt like a more two way process and enabled me to get a feel for the culture of the organisation.  Although I did not get offered the role the outcome was communicated to me promptly  and I appreciate that I was given detailed verbal feedback and advice that will help me in the future.,0.0008744204,0.010111206,0.9890143
Good and quick process had named contact with HR. Online form to fill was a bit of a faff but essentially needed cv details and a personal statement tailored to the job and person spec.

2 parts: team workshop with potential line reports then presentation of results to hiring managers and competency based questions. I had no issues with the interview format itself but was tremendously disappointed in having to chase on multiple occasions for any relevant feedback.   I suspect they were after gold dust for a temp Head of role; given I had applied directly had no offer interview and then had 5 agencies approach me with said role.   On the plus side the interview and preinterview process was standard and meeting the team was a great aspect of the interview. The major con as mentioned before was having to chase literally for 4 weeks to get any helpful feedback to learn from. For a senior role that I had prepared for a 2 hour interview for this was plain unprofessional.,0.94743806,0.051642224,0.0009196787

I applied on the PDSA website and the short time later I was emailed by the practice manager to attend an interview which I subsequently attended I travelled 400 miles to Swansea for this interview and invested a considerable amount of time and had to book a hotel to be able to attend this interview. On the morning of the interview I met the head nurse and we had a oneonone interview and the first question that she asked me if I was local had I travelled far and then this took me back and it showed me that she had not reviewed my details and did not have the due diligence to check key information about candidates such as location. She then asked me a variety of common interview questions about my experiences and then the interview was concluded. I received a email about a week later to say that I hadn’t got the job because of practical experience even though I had a years worth of work experience in a veterinary practice where I did all basic practical tasks and outside of this. I also had experience in several other different animal settings where I did all aspects of practical animal husbandry and care. The only part of the job role that I did not have experience with was receptionist experience and experience of animal anaesthesia. I was very surprised when she asked me if I had animal anaesthesia experience as this really should not be a responsibility of a veterinary care assistant and the extent to which the veterinary care assistant role has come to have such a broad scope of responsibilities breaching into clinical duties where they really should not be doing them and it should be the responsibility of a veterinary surgeon and a veterinary nurse highlighted to me what appears to be a declining level of standards in the veterinary industry. In my application I mentioned nothing about having experience of animal anaesthesia monitoring or receptionist experience so it shows to me that they had not properly reviewed my CV in relation to what they supposedly wanted and showed no real respect for what I had invested in the interview process up until that point.,0.99842143,0.0014378548,0.00014065113

1 hour interview via Zoom with a task that needed to be completed. Interview with the manager and press officer. Asked about my experience and what I could bring to the team.   The team does not value diversity no ethnic minorities in the whole of the company. I think racism plays a part here .  I also didn’t get any feedback the team should have the decency to least provide that. During the interview a very sarky comment was made ‘ Do you even own a pet’ which was not needed.   I didn’t get the job because I don’t have blonde hair I was clearly more than qualified. Also they continued to ask me how I gained coverage I can only assume they wanted my tips and ideas because they couldn’t get this type of coverage themselves. E.g TV Coverage .  Didn’t get the job because they didn’t feel like I would fit into the team feedback should be offered . I also hope in the future they invest more in diversity and inclusion.

Overall a negative candidate experience. Was contacted to arrange an interview over a month after applying for the job. I did the interview at very short notice (several hours notice only). The interview lasted 1hr 15 mins and was 100% aimed at ascertaining if I shared the values of Plan International by asking me a number of questions based around those values. I wasn't asked any questions about my experience or what I had been doing no questions about my CV etc. I was told that they always do first interviews like this based only on the values. At the end of the interview I was told that they would be moving quickly and that they would get back to me with the outcome of the first interview in a 'couple of days'. A week later I'd not heard anything so I emailed chasing for an update but I did not get any reply. Two weeks later and still no reply or update since the interview unfortunately. I can appreciate the importance of values and so understand why they wanted to see if I fit. But values do work both ways and they didn't demonstrate one of their own values  doing what they say they will (ie letting me know the outcome in a couple of days). In the current climate especially candidate experience is very important. Candidates applying for jobs do need to be shown some empathy I think and not ghosted.,0.99734986,0.0025124464,0.00013767049

Very poor experience. My application was delayed for months with no communication eventually costing me a potential job which I worked hard for. I would recommend applying directly to the police as this company are very incompetent and don't put in much effort. I was deceived about the roles available and classed as a late applicant due to their lack of action and communication. Extremely annoyed was also told a manager would call me and that lasted about 20 seconds today. She didn't even ask what had happened and it was her colleague who offered the call last week.   I was on a standby list for the very same job that apparently wasn't available originally and caused a long delay. Massively disappointing don't put your hopes on this company as they cannot deliver.

I successfully completed the online assessments which included written questions video responses and situational judgment questions. The police now recruitment team told me to wait for further information about the interview. They did not reply to any of my emails. I then messaged them on Instagram and they reassured me that they are still giving out interview dates it was just a matter of time. In the meantime I invested my time and money to prepare for the interview. After waiting over a month I got an email saying that due to a large number of applicants “it is regrettable that we will not be able to progress your application further “. Unfortunately I am not the only person who has experienced this feel free to look on the studentroom forums.   A clear lack of organisation and transparency with their applicants. I have never experienced being given an interview offer and then have this opportunity retracted. I think it’s common sense to close the application process once you have enough applicants rather than offering interviews above capacity.

"One of the worst companies I have ever applied to! A massive warning to all future applicants that Police Now are one of the most incompetent companies and ways to enter this industry by far.  I passed all interviews up till the video and upon this they only give three pieces of feedback back. This feedback was rather vague and does not specify certain components you failed like all Graduate schemes do. I emailed in regarding this and requested for better feedback because without a proper reason as to why my application was progressed I took it was my background that affected this. Now one senior recruitment member stated to me they ""blind'mark"" the work and this is a blatant lie because she could not justify why my application was rejected. A note to all candidates that THEY DO NOT BLIND MARK WORK they see what you look like on video they have access to your name address education and intuitions obviously to progress certain applicants on their background.  In all said person was clueless and incompetent like her staff shes does not know what she's talking about and their whole application process is a mess and a waste of time. Every Graduate Scheme gives proper feedback after video/timed assessments Police Now are just biased and a bunch of time wasters. They like to argue that they are fair and equal but they do not play by these rules they do not impose blindmarking and by not giving you actual feedback they hide the discrepancies in their application process and obviously do not have to answer to a higher power.",0.99876416,0.0010872305,0.00014859914

Things like roleplay and scenariobased task can sound scary if it's something you've not encountered before but the best advice I can give is be yourself and trust your instincts.

Applied online on the website and got a first stage interview offer 1 week later. The interview has multiple stages which is set at different dates. The interview took place via Microsoft Teams with two members of staff (Operations Manager and Service Delivery Manager).   The interview consisted of 6 questions both members of staff were very warm positive and welcoming. The interview lasted for 30 minutes. After this an explanation was given about the role what it would require and I was given the opportunity to ask any extra questions at the end. In total the interview lasted 45 minutes.  The second stage interview would have consisted of travelling to a youth centre or school in order to see how one would interact with the youth and if you have any further questions.  Throughout the interview as well as sharing your own experiences from your voluntary work or your previous jobs you do constantly have to refer back to the Prince's Trust job specification and discuss how you demonstrate these otherwise you will not progress.

There were 6 questions which is standard for any junior role at PT including YDL usually including a question about EDI and the other questions were based off of points in the job description. Some questions asked for examples however some didn’t yet it was clear in the feedback that this is when I lost points. I do think that this should be looked at as people with certain learning needs need explicit questions. You could also set interviewees up to do better by sending them the questions ahead of time rather than expecting them to ask for them and answer quite lengthy questions on the spot. It was also clear that the interviewers were not well trained when doing the interviews as sometimes it was very clear that the interviewer or hiring manager had already made their decision and prejudgement. In 3 roles I applied for it was clear someone had already been lined up for the role and if this is the case please don’t ask other people to waste their time and resources applying.,0.99194884,0.007862802,0.00018835587

The Interviewer was horrid she was laughing the whole way through the interview. Considering she is from a BAME background that was really shocking. Appalling behaviour and quite frankly disgusting.   The company does not believe in helping disadvantaged people if you do not employ them. They hardly employ black people and I can only assume there is some sort of disdain there. I think if you as a charity are positioning yourself as a brand to help disadvantaged children you kind of need people from disadvantage backgrounds.   It’s a disgrace.

I applied online completing a long application form.  The interview process followed a very traditional format of answering predetermined questions to a panel of two staff members. It was very clear that I was one in a long line of candidates being interviewed one after the other. I was taken into a room and offered water. There were several empty cups on the table from previous interviews indicating that at least 5 people had been seen before me. There was a feeling of rushed urgency to the interview meaning that it was over within 30 minutes. I felt like I answered the questions to the best of my ability but the format of the interview process didn't allow me to express as much of my personality; a more casual approach incorporating the format of questions would have permitted a more detailed look into each candidate's nature.  I was offered a second interview which followed exactly the same format except with a change in the panel and the questions. I was also asked to prepare a short presentation on the benefits of commercialising a previously free event offered by The Trust.

I glanced at them at the end of my interview and they both tensed up so I speculate they intended to cut my interview short for a reason unknown to me.,0.9751159,0.02472506,0.00015905527
Very easy great communication with hiring manager. The interview itself was fantastic experience and although i neer recieved a job offer I was provided with invaluable feedback that will help my career progression,0.0005114656,0.0006264298,0.99886215
Relaxed and professional.  I had to do a task for 30 minutes at the start which was based on creating a digital strategy. I was then interviewed by two senior staff members. I heard back later that day with a job offer which I accepted.,0.0026894163,0.24116105,0.75614953
I was more showcasing my personality and who i was as a person. It felt more like a conversation rather then an interview as i was meeting a group off people that wanted me to succeed.,0.00046020484,0.9989882,0.0005516742
Most of the application and interview process was straightforward enough. The online application system is a tad dated and clunky but I sent off my application without a hitch and was pleased to be invited in for an interview soon afterwards.   The interview itself went smoothly and seemed well organised. I completed a written exercise and then spent 45 minutes or so answering a series of questions put to me by the interview panel. Everything went fine: they were friendly the questions were reasonable and I thought my performance was OK.   However my experience then turned very negative. I was told they'd inform me of the outcome as soon as possible but after two weeks I still hadn't heard anything back from them. No phone call no email no update on the online system. Nothing.   I sent polite messages to the head of the department I was applying to and to the HR team saying I assumed I hadn't got the job but could they please confirm this and offer some feedback. After all I was busy applying to lots of other vacancies elsewhere so it would be useful to be certain about what had happened to my application to The Prince's Trust and to receive feedback that could help me in future interviews.    Initially there was no response. Then almost a month after the interview I got an email confirming that my application was unsuccessful. I was told some feedback would be sent my way soon. However it has still not appeared.   I understand The Prince's Trust staff are stretched and busy and that contacting unsuccessful job applicants isn't going to be their number one priority but I still think this is a pretty shoddy way to treat people that undermines The Prince's Trust's reputation. I put in a huge amount of time and effort reading up on the organisation working on my application and preparing for the interview. It's not unreasonable to expect confirmation of whether I'd got the job or not within a two week timeframe...or at least an update on when I could expect to hear from them. I came to GlassDoor and saw reviews suggesting previous applicants had the same sort of experience.   It's certainly affected my opinion of The Prince's Trust as a charity: if they're disorganised in this way what other parts of the organisation aren't providing a good service? And if I had got the job would it actually have been a supportive place to work? I've since secured a job elsewhere and can't help but think it's maybe for the best I didn't end up at The Prince's Trust.,0.98296887,0.016756637,0.0002745679
Actual interview was okay. However the process both before and after the interview was chaotic with the hiring manager emailing me about the interview and asking if time/date was okay and then going on leave until the date she had proposed for my actual interview. I did in the end make it to the interview and about two weeks after requested feedback even just being told I hadn't got the role would have been enough but despite numerous follow up efforts I received no reply. I feel it says a lot about a manager/organisation if they cannot respect how much effort it takes to prepare for an interview and at least let candidates know whether or not they have been successful.,0.9685272,0.031248268,0.00022444042

I was asked ""What makes you the best candidate against the others"" which is a terrible question as we all know! Was allowed to ask 2 questions at the end with only a few minutes to go before the end of the interview as their timings didn't allow for any time to reflect on my answers.

Overall the interview went very well and it was a good experience. Jordan was very informative when I asked questions at the end and it gave me a good understanding of the role what RHP does and what RHP is like as an employer.  The 40 min psychometric test to be completed prior to interview (through a gamelike app) was different to traditional tests and it was very challenging in my opinion. The feedback from this however was very insightful and moreorless accurate!  Following the interview I was asked to complete some tasks by the same day  one was a response to a customer's email and the other was to order tasks based on priority and describe why. I was unsure about something in one of the tasks and Hannah was very quick to clarify it for me.  Overall throughout the application and interview process Hannah kept me well informed.

Both had question sheets and they started to ask questions but neither were writing answers I found this strange. After the first couple of questions the interview went off the scripted questions and turned into a very informal chat we talked about my previous experiences and some smalltalk about this and that it was like being in the pub with work colleagues I got the distinct impression that I wasn't what they were looking for. They were both very polite and saw me out of the building.   I didn't hear anything from them and decided to chase up and request an outcome and some feedback to date I'm still waiting I guess that means I was unsuccessful.

"Application process Request to submit my CV but recruitment consultant. Was warned the client were very picky  Interview was scheduled at 11 o'clock. I arrived 15 minutes early and sat in reception and the interview started at 11:20. They were 20 minutes late with no apology whatsoever.   First and final stage  with  (CIO) and  (Internals Communications and Engagement Manager). Was told by the interviewers interview would last 30 minutes.  Communications manager explained interview structure (preplanned questions) and then asked if I had any questions to be begin. Explained that I would prefer to run through questions as the interview proceeds so the interview is more of a 2 way conversation and they happily agreed with that.  Was asked to name the companies I had delivered intranets as my cv documented this heavily (all of my contract roles had involved intranet replacements) but I listed the names and they seemed satisfied.   Answered questions gave examples where allowed  The CIO made a strange comment towards the end of the interview on how they are looking for interims rather than contractors that I was more of an interim that takes pride in their delivery. I took that as a compliment but I interviewed for the role as a contractor.    Feedback from the agency the loveliest recruitment consultant who said he was at the end of his tether with the client was they (the client) didn't believe I would be able to deliver/cope.  The recruitment consultant said he was shocked at their feedback as from my experience I had evidence of having delivered the same project over and over again the agencies thoughts was that this feedback was generic.  I considered this feedback to be Slanderous as my experience todate at all of my contracts comes with references of having delivered. Taking into consideration their view on ""constructive feedback"" and their current reviews on Glassdoor I would go so far as to say this company may not be best environment to work in. I received an offer of employment on the same day I received this feedback it pays more and is in the Private sector which is a place where I think I will stay.",0.99728966,0.002571407,0.00013896645
60 minute interview followed by a knowledge test. The facetoface interview went very well and the chemistry was good the interviewers (2 of them) were very structured and followed a form to carry the interview through (literally by the book type approach). I was sent to a separate office to complete a skills & knowledge test that took about 1520 minutes.  The outcome was negative and the only feedback was that I failed the test. No details no information therefore no chance to develop myself better.

The tasks were ok but the time definitely passed very quickly. Then the interviewers (2 of them) asked how I thought I'd done and my strategy with the time limit etc. The next part was 45 minutes of interview which actually overran a bit but mainly due to them answering my questions very fully which was nice. They asked a few questions about why I wanted to work there and then some behavioural questions with follow ups to my examples. I tried to stick to the STAR method when answering.

The second stage was a group task solving a problem. The scenario involved preventing the spread of nuclear radiation via purchasing materials with a limited amount of money. The third stage involved two tests: One was editing a paper for chemical and grammatical errors; the other was writing a brief summary of 5 research papers.

We then had lunch and carried out 3 tasks  writing an email editing a poorly written paper and finding key words from 5 papers.

Applied at the end of December got an email saying someone would be in touch but heard nothing until early April when I was invited to an assessment day the very next week. Day was on Thursday was offered the job next Friday but had received another offer in the meantime and had accepted that one.  Job sounded fantastic on paper (and has a brilliant salary) however it was a long way from home and didn't enjoy the tests (which give a good indication of what the job would be like) on the day.  Assessment day consisted of a practical group exercise (problem solving) a tour of the building with some talks from current employees interview and individual exercises. Individual exercises were last and felt tougher than they needed to be at the end of the very long day. Had to write a reply email to an author edit a paper with mistakes and inconsistencies everywhere and do a 'keywords' exercise where we were given 6 journals had to write summaries for 2 of them and pick out key words from the other 4. Made it very obvious that science journals are exceptionally dry to read and really cemented my decision not to take the job.   Would recommend applying (and following up if you don't hear anything after a couple of weeks) and going to an assessment day if you get invited as it really gives a good indication of what the job is like.,0.9930789,0.006525278,0.00039584667
"I applied in late December and was invited to an interview in early February. The application process required filling in an online CV template and answering some questions about the RSC and my motivation to work for them. The assessment centre was held at their headquarters in Cambridge with 11 other candidates. I also interviewed for the Development Editor role. They reimburse expenses up to £100 and more if you notify them. The assessment centre was structured like so: An introductory presentation on the RSC followed by an icebreaker exercise. A tour of the offices and the opportunity to ask current Publishing Editors as well as other staff about the role organisation and responsibilities etc. A group exercise where you are watched by a number of assessors. A lunch where you can talk to the assessors and other Publishing Editors. An interview with two interviewers. This was probably around 4050 minutes and started with questions such as ""why do you want to work for the RSC"" ""How do you feel you did in the group exercise"". Before moving on to my understanding of the role and key skills. Finishing with competency based questions. Individual editing exercises comprised of editing an article ( this contains numerous grammatical and chemical errors) composing an email response to an author and a keywords exercise (summarise in a few sentences two papers and then pick keywords for various papers).

The group exercise was a typical problem solving exercise and took roughly 45 minutes. This exercise was to test your ability to work in a team general communication skills and ability to plan. This was a fun exercise and the best part of the day. The competency based interview was the usual type of questions ""Tell me a time when..."" but the company did not inform candidates in which style to answer the questions. Candidates were penalised for using a STAR not SHARE approach with the interviewers not correcting/prompting myself to switch style and explain the SHARE approach. The interviewers were also unresponsive and unfriendly and made the atmosphere hostile and unwelcoming. The tour of the Royal Society of Chemistry in principle sounds exciting however consisted of a tour around several offices and was unnecessary as everyone knows what an office looks like. In addition this tour added another hour onto an already long day. Although this tour would have been fine if done at the end of the day. The tour did allow the opportunity to ask staff about the company but again was pointless as directly after the tour there was a 90 minute section to ask employees about the company! There were three individual exercises at the end of the day which were: editing a journal picking keywords from 6 full length journals and writing two emails all within 90 minutes.  The editing a journal was a good exercise and allowed candidates to understand what the role would involve. However the journal had been altered so significantly by the interviewers that it was almost impossible to follow and if had been received by a real editor would have been binned immediately.  The objective of the keyword exercise was not clearly explained and was an unfair attempt by the interviewers to ascertain whether candidates had a ""broad chemistry knowledge"" despite the fact the exercise was very subjective. An exam or writing an abstract would have been more appropriate with most candidates being unhappy with this task.  The final exercise involved writing two emails to customers to understand if the candidates written communication was acceptable. Again the explanation of what to do was poor and candidates were given too little information to write an appropriate email response. This task also involved writing the email by hand which is not the usual way of working so candidates who have poor hand writing and spelling were penalised. Despite the fact these issues would not have been a problem if the exercise was done on a computer. Finally the company failed to send me an email or phone me with their decision/feedback. I had to both email and ring the company to ascertain whether I had been successful.",0.9882167,0.010466685,0.0013165419
We had a full day interview consisting of a group assessment an individual exercise a tour of the RSC and then an individual interview.  The group assessment was a problem solving task that you had to work as a team to accomplish as you were being observed by a panel of employees.

The individual interview last 45 minutes.,0.017357908,0.98215955,0.0004824755
The interview is a daylong process with actual interviews group activities as well well as personal exercises. The interview is very streamlined which does not feel like a conversation but rather like an oral exam. One has to say the relevant words/keywords to appeal to the interviewers. Also they present parts of the job in a more appealing way and sometimes fallacious way (as mentioning conference attendance as being part of the position),0.8767865,0.12186181,0.0013517607

The job description had lots of spelling mistakes and the name of the manager was not given which I felt was a great oversight.  A personality test is used.  This is has real value for use in screening out extremes eg narcissistic behaviour and was pleasing to see.  For anything more subtle it was  like a horoscope ie true however you filled it in.  I filled it in honestly and it came out looking as if the test was unreliable.  I imagine it would be easy to look at the job description and fill it in according to the desired traits.  The time taken to do the test is given so if you have lots of interruptions it will look as if you took a long time to complete the test.  The face of the person interviewing me visibly fell when she saw me.  I had brushed and polished myself up so it was probably my gender or age that was  the problem.  i imagine that the job went to an internal candidate.

I applied weeks before the deadline and received an invitation for an interview only 3 days after the deadline date.

I had to give a 10 minute presentation on what I could bring to the position. Then they interviewed me for around 50 minutes and lastly I was shown around the lab and the rest of the campus,0.0017774515,0.20006435,0.7981582
I attended an interview for a Research Assistant position. The interview was scheduled for 90 minutes.  Upon being seated in the interview room I was informed that the Group Leader would not be attending the interview. No reason was provided for her nonattendance. I felt the interview should have been cancelled and rescheduled if the entire selection committee was not able to attend.  The interview was poorly structured and poorly organised as the panel of two had no pre set questions to ask me regarding the position or the Sanger Institute itself.   The interviewer informed me that the position was required for 8 months only. However this was not stated in the job description.    None of the interviewers present were able to answer my questions. Both could not explain the scientific concepts neither in words nor sentences even though my question was about something highlighted on their group website.   The interviewers did not have a copy of my CV or the job description to hand. No Human Resources staff were present during the interview and no copies of my qualifications or ID were requested.  The interview lasted for a total of 25 minutes. The interviewers informed me that I would hear back in one week regarding an outcome. Fifty minutes afterward a recruitment adviser sent an email to say my application will not be progressed. However when requested she could not provide any feedback.   I was offended at the poor and unprofessional interview conduct of the interviewers.  The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute itself looks like Elysium space station.

I undertook two interviews for two different administrative positions at Save the Children. I was given very little notice to prepare (2 days) and both times had to complete preinterview tests (prioritising and spreadsheet comprehension based.)  While the interviewers were generally polite during both interviews they came across very snooty. This is a problem in the international development sector anyhow. Yes you work to 'save children' but have a bit of humility please!  The office is beautiful but the small room in which they my interviews meant I could see everything impolite which was getting written about me which is very offputting!  But the worst part for me is that after both interviews none of them contacted me with the result. I've clearly been declined but please recognize the massive effort and emotionaltoll on the job seeker that has decided to approach you. They have for however long taken rejection after rejection and have probably worked very hard just to prepare for this interview. It takes very little time to copy and paste a rejection to me and the 6 or 7 other people you reject at interview stage. In fact I'd consider it basic politeness.  I knew after walking out of there that I wouldn't fit in anyhow because I want to help the needy too but I don't need to look down my nose at other people in the process.,0.9922214,0.007347632,0.0004308521

One of the interviewers was incredibly patronising and rude.,0.9988311,0.001014021,0.00015490732
Seemed quite disorganised being asked to interview the day after being contacted by HR.  One of the interviewers was quite combative and dismissive of any questions and answers outside their own job. A lot of questions were about safeguarding and bullying which may be unsurprising considering the issues the charity has faced.   Strangely there wasn't many questions about the actual job outside risk assessment.,0.9972626,0.0025819072,0.00015545967
Shortlisting followed by a 1st stage interview and finally a 2nd/final stage one.  I wasn't given much time to prepare for the interview.

Applied online through job platform after few days got a call and invited to the interview. They sent me email bout what to bring to the interview (documents and forms). I arrived early and the hiring manager was so nice and friendly. Not that formal interview basic questions really friendly just want to know bout you and your experiences.  After a week I got the offer the hiring manager called me but unfortunately have to declined the offer due to the work place too far for me to commute (it advertised to be in Manchester but it is at Sale).

It was a two stage interview. First stage was face to face group interview where we sat next to another candidate and had a few minutes to find out about them and then introduce them to the rest of the group explaining what they had to offer. The next task was working in groups of 4 we were given a scenario of being ship wrecked. We were given a list of items to choose from and prioritise which items we would need first. The last task was an independent writing task. We were give some background information of a customer and had about 15 mins to write up an action plan.. Following this first stage any successful candidates were then contacted by email and short listed for a panel interview the following week.

The interview process was pretty straightforward.   I had been tasked to put together a presentation discussing key insights in data that Sense had provided.   The actual interview itself was a panel interview with three Sense employees where I had spent about 10 mins presenting my findings. After that we spent the rest of the hour going through typical interview questions.  After this I did not hear a word from Sense. I had spent over 3 days working on the task itself and even longer preparing for the interview and I didn't even get an email saying I was rejected! I chased the HR person who had contacted me initially about the interview but was ignored.   If you expect people to give up their time preparing for an interview and working to put together a whole presentation the least they could expect is an email turning them down!,0.6264701,0.3723768,0.001153115

Group interview session firstly.  Then formal interview the following week.  In the group session we were given two 'Job Adverts' in which we had to highlight the errors.   Then a group discussion on problem solving for everyday issues we would face if we were a HR Administrator.  The formal interview was a standard panel interview with competency questions and a couple of questions about why I want to work for sense or what attracted me to the role   I felt very uncomfortable in the group assessment.  One person in particular who works there I felt judged me to the point I felt I shouldn't be there and I wanted to walk out when we switched tasks. I felt very much like they just asked me to come along to fill a chair.  Wasn't a pleasant experience at all.  I was VERY surprised to have been asked back for the formal interview.

Prepare a presentation and then attend an 'assessment day'.

There were SHL tests but having known each other's scores it was clear that these were not used in the recruitment process (why use them?) and an interview with the extremely condescending CEO.,0.99880755,0.001033607,0.00015883031

This was not a good interview. I was asked to complete a written to test and then prepare a presentation to give to a panel. I was then told there was an informal interview. There was not. The panel proceeded to ask set questions from a piece of paper that seemed very robotic and pointless for a Charity job. They were quick to get back with feedback through a phone call but were incredibly ignorant. They congratulated me on how well I'd done 'seeing as it was my first ever interview.' I am in my mid 20s and have several jobs and successful interviews as I had discussed in my job history review so that was completely bizarre. They also then proceeded to give me tips on how to behave in interview as they did not like the fact that I described myself as 'passionate and caring'.

5 min presentation of my CV then competency based questions. Your answers are then marked and if you score high enough you may be offered the role.

Shaw Trust where very accommodating of my reasonable adjustments because of a disability. The assessment consistent of a scenario  regarding a client and their barriers to employments. the applicant had to write a number of personal goals action points for the clients as well as identify what employability support they need and what additional support/referral you may do. 2. Role play : this lasted 15 minutes and was timed a interviewer acted the client while the other wrote notes. the interview read a script at the beginning for context. this was very relaxed 3. formal interview: the interview consisted of 7 questions asked by the panel of 2 this again was quite relaxed and informal with added general conversation.

During the interview I found myself facing an interview panel that appeared amicable at first glance. However I couldn't help but notice subtle judgments exchanged through glances as I answered their competencybased questions. This created a highly uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the interview. Additionally I was surprised to be presented with tasks that seemed unrelated to the administrative position I was interviewing for. These tasks included arranging 12 multiple priorities in order of importance and most bewildering of all proofreading a literary text. The mismatch between the tasks and the position left me confused as I had expected the focus to be on administrative skills rather than editing proficiency.   Despite being informed that I would receive a response regarding the outcome of the interview by the end of the day I never received a phone call or email. This experience was extremely disheartening and left me questioning my abilities. However most importantly it served as a revealing demonstration of the company's systemic cultural issues in how they interact with people. Undoubtedly this ranks among the worst interview experiences I have encountered. In hindsight I can't help but feel fortunate to have avoided a potentially detrimental situation.,0.9974324,0.0024149984,0.00015252587

The interview questions were very much based on my own experiences of handling difficult/sensitive situations and a test of my integrity and ability to empathise which was really refreshing for an interview and certainly tells me that Shelter appear to value integrity over what people can regurgitate from their CV.  However the reason why I am rating the experience down is because they didn't have the common curtesy of letting me know the outcome of my interview (obviously it was not successful).  However taking into consideration the hours spent filling out a job application writing a cover letter preparing for and taking time out of work to interview...its really the least they can do.,0.9773219,0.021539604,0.0011385075

There were three Shelter team members on my remote interview one of which kept leaving his desk for periods of time while I was answering the panel’s questions. He assured me he was still listening despite not being on screen but I found it very off putting and it made me feel as though my interview was not taken seriously.    I was actually glad not to be offered the role but asked for feedback on my interview to help me improve. I never received any even after chasing the HR contact which I think is pretty unprofessional considering the entire application and interview process I had been through.,0.99809533,0.0017748274,0.0001298284
"The interview process was in two sections a panel interview and a ""meet the team"" session which I found to be a great approach. The questions were relatively straight forward in keeping with interviews for similar roles in other organisations and was a comfortable experience (overlooking the fact the interviewing director was dressed in his gym kit). I was informed that I would hear back early the following week (my interview was on a Thursday). I had heard nothing by late the following week when I decided to email the recruitment team and ask for an update the only response I got was 36 hours later when an automated email landed in my inbox inviting me to interview and to book my interview online. I thought this was strange as it was not in keeping with the personal emails I had received to date but as a second stage of interviews had been mentioned as a possibility it wasn't completely out of the blue. I followed the link but wasn't offered any options for booking an interview slot. I tried to call the HR number and there was no answer so I left a voicemail. I followed up with an email and confirmed some additional information requested in the invitation email. 30 minutes later I received another automated email informing me that I was not being offered the role and thanking me for my time with no offering of feedback or the opportunity to ask for any. This automated rejection email was sent at 17:20 on a Friday evening meaning I had no way of clarifying the situation until at least the Monday. I have sent a follow up email to clarify that has again gone unanswered. I think if this is the way Shelter treat people who are applying to join their organisation then I have had a lucky escape as from my experience they do not value or appreciate people or the time they take to complete their recruitment processes. One of the worst recruitment processes I have experienced to date. A disgusting way to treat applicants ironic considering the charities work is focused on helping and supporting vulnerable people.",0.99465066,0.0047890977,0.000560267
A long time after I applied I was sent an invitation to interview (with a lot of notice which was good). The interview was with 2 people who asked a lot of questions from what seemed to be a set list (not really a flowing conversation).  I felt like I was asked about things that were above and beyond the job description  implying a lot more responsibility for important things than the job description detailed. Lots of 2part questions. I still answered the questions well despite feeling interrogated. They said they would get back to me in a week's time and never did.,0.48846692,0.5103409,0.001192166

I had a 45 minute assessment including a typing test Excel task and an InTray Exercise. This was followed by a behaviour based panel interview.  All members of staff I encountered were lovely and welcoming. However 5 minutes into my assessment I could hear somebody next door talking very loudly about how good the previous candidate in before me had been. Maybe I got the wrong end of the stick but safe to say I found it off putting and a bit disrespectful.  Despite this my interview seemed to go quite well.  I was also told that I’d hear back in a few days regardless of whether it was good or bad news so as ‘not to keep me in anticipation’. I’d heard nothing so I attempted to chase it up. 2 weeks later and still nothing.,0.0026803424,0.99579597,0.0015237811

The interviews themselves were fine. When they were finally set up. Weeks later than expected. It took several more than a month before I was invited for my first interview. Thereafter it was almost 2 months before I heard back. Granted Covid had just hit so I gave benefit of doubt. But thereafter it was a series of following up being told to expect feedback or an interview date within a certain time frame not hearing back within said time frame and it took another month just to get an interview date. After the 2nd interview I didn't hear back for almost 2 months and it was the same back and forth. I felt really disappointed in the process.

You're interviewed by different people each time which is a shame as it never feels as if Social Finance can build an understanding of you.  Very long process (with a lot of effort required) so it's disheartening that you don't receive feedback. Moreover the competency interview is far too short to build any sort of picture of a candidate's capabilities (just 5 questions asked). I suspect they weigh the case interview section particularly high relative to the competency part.

There was no feedback given at the end of the second round. Comms from the internal recruiter / manager of the hiring process were unclear.  Overall the experience left a very sour taste in my mouth.

"They asked about 10 questions in the format of ""when were you in an X situation and what did you do"". I find that process was very stressful especially because there were three interviewers in the room with me. Only one question did not follow that format. For me personally at least it is very difficult to remember so many scenarios from your past in just a few minutes. The interview process also contained a written assignment which I did not mind. But overall I think the difficulty of the interview was unreasonable considering the relatively low pay of the role.

My general experience with St. Mungo's Bristol was very negative one. I myself have learning difficulties i made the company extra aware of this. They said they would give me an extra 15 minutes on assesment  which was fine but still not great. I asked if I could type my answers rather than write and I recieved no answer back. The lack of communication was worrying to start with.   I was placed into a room where I had to complete three assements where they were all writing based. I don't have the best writing or grammar due to my disability I can struggle. I was stopped 15 minutes earlier before my allocated time and made to hurry. These were also all unpaid. I also did a role play with two managers the two people were very nice if slightly uninterestes.  As the previous candidate said 'The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth' and i feel that is justified and the perfect summary. I took time out my busy schedule with the NHS to attend the interview and my NHS management were great in placating this. It seemed to be one 'generic one size fits all' assement for everyone which I think is wrong. I think the procedure was ableist if not slightly out dated. Everyone has different skill sets regardless of how you communicate in writing or typing.    This whole experience has taught me a invaluable lesson though. That is to not have anything similar to this recruitment process when I start my own charity.,0.9965706,0.0032100996,0.00021929704

Applied online and was invited to an online interview. You have to complete two online assessments ahead of time which seems odd and was slightly offputting. Make sure you are prepared before you take these assessments. The interview started off with a task of drafting a letter to an MP then a 15minute roleplay of a persuasive discussion with said MP followed by a formal interview w/ panel. Each section was relatively challenging as there is very little you can do to prepare ahead of time.  The interview panel is much less competencybased and consists of questions where you need to demonstrate that you did something within the policy sphere. Be prepared and have a lot of examples where you accomplished results. The interview panel was cordial but not 'chatty' as there was no small talk or any time for informal discussion.

I was required to take an online verbal reasoning test prior to the interview. This consisted of a English based test (reading a script and answering Q's) then a math test which was fairly basic. They say it does not affect your scoring and seemed really pointless.  The interview process was 2 hours!! I had to do a written tasks where I wrote an email to a customer and then prepare for a role play. I then joined the call for the interview. We started off with the role play where one of the interviewers acted as the customer and I was a member of staff. This was fairly straightforward but I can imagine doing this in person would be off putting. This was followed by a set of questions on how I found the role play and whether I would change anything. I then had the panel interview which consisted of all competency based questions so again not too challenging.   The panel seemed very friendly slightly unprofessional at times and I can imagine if I was interviewing in person as opposed to over video call I would have felt a bit uncomfortable.

I interviewed for the Street Legal Team and I am yet to hear back even though the interview was over a month ago. I can obviously take the hint and guess I haven’t been successful on this occasion but I find it very unprofessional to not let a candidate know even after 2 follow up emails.   The interview was average in terms of difficulty. First you do a verbal reasoning test prior to the interview which was much easier than the ones I had practiced online simply picking true or false rather than having a ‘cannot say’ option for each text.   Next there is the written test which again was easier than the ones I had practiced. First was writing a formal letter on behalf of a client requesting that their debt to the NHS for medical care be reduced or wiped as the individual is homeless and non uk National so no recourse to public funds. Next was a prioritisation exercise where you’re given 5 simple tasks and have to say what order you’d complete them and why. Finally was a petty cash sheet which was just simple reading of a table inserting the numbers in the correct columns and basic adding up. You’re given an hour to complete all of these  and prepare for the role play.    The role play was about a client who had drug problems and had stopped attending the social prescribing session which he had previously been very passionate about and had missed a few key working sessions with you. The aim was to discover what the problem was and come up with a solution. In this case the client had been hearing other people going to the session talking bad things about him so we decided to find another group for him to go to.   Straight after was the panel interview with two individuals from the team. They took turns in asking questions and asked about 8 questions in total I think. All the questions are situational as with the application. They do not ask questions about your CV experience or anything mentioned in the application specifically. It’s up to you to bring up these examples. Use the STAR structure as recommended for the application when answering these questions. I’m pretty sure that’s what they want.,0.9975914,0.0022603746,0.00014832898
Had to complete verbal reasoning test online. On the day I completed a written exercise and planned for a role play. Interview was the role play and 7 questions about skills and experience,0.050172836,0.9495266,0.00030048646
I have to do a literacy competency test before the interview date which was simple.  I then had a assignment task  3 different questions about how I would approach different parts of the job and prep time for a role play the hour before the interview. The interview itself was fairly simple  the panel were welcoming and kind and they went through a sheet of questions  all competency based. Similar to those asked in the application form,0.00084656937,0.9957029,0.0034505508
The panel was friendly and kind. They made me feel at ease and they smiled a lot. I didn't feel any pressure during the interview and they also gave me very detailed feedback even if I didn't get the job. I was surprised because it never happened to me that a recruiter (in this case the manager in charge) showed himself so interested in me and my skills as individual and not only as a number and a potential candidate to which attribute importance only during the interview.  The process to be selected for the interview is quite long. The first application consists of 9 or 10 questions very detailed to answer. Then if you are selected you will have to do a quick attitudinal test (but I personally felt that it was difficult and unhelpful to understand something about the candidate) then they will ask you to fill a written assessment (for example in my case I had to analyse a situation where a homeless was involved and identify actions objectives who is taking those actions and how much time is required to accomplish them) and to prepare a Role Play. During the proper interview we did the roleplay (10 minutes) and then they asked me questions about my previous experience and what I would have improved about the role play that I did.,0.58911216,0.40408078,0.0068070735
"Robotic purely competence based. Panel showed no real warmth or interest in me as an individual.  The procedure was a written test followed by a role play and a set of competency based questions.  The whole process and interaction with the interview panel staff seemed mechanical and lacked warmth.  We went straight into a role play situation and then into  a set of competency based questions where you are required to follow the principle of describing a situation your actions and the result.  I understand the need for these but it was very nonwelcoming it felt like being processed like a sheep.   There was ZERO desire shown by the panel to understand me as a candidate or person. The whole interview was just purely about asking questions and felt very much like a dry outdated process which lacked any real desire to get to know me and why I was applying for the role.   After those competency based questions were over I fully expected to be asked a bit more about myself.  I was NOT ASKED any of the standard questions you would expect at some point so that you can give them a better understanding of you as a person and what you can bring to the organistion.   ""tell me about yourself"" ""tell me about your work history?"" ""tell me about your current/most recent roles and what you enjoy about them?"" ""why do you want to do this specific role and what makes you a good fit for the role?"" ""what hobbies or interests do you have?""  These are some basic questions that I expected to be asked after the whole situation based questionning but I wasnt asked a single one of them. These sort of questions give you a chance to sell yourself descibe your skills and talents and give them an opportunity to get to know YOU as a PERSON not just a candidate.   An interview should be about twoway communication not just you sitting there answering dry questions in a robotic manner whilst the panel sit there taking notes on everything you say instead of actually showing any real interest in you.  The whole interview process was dry lacked any real human warmth and it was so apparent that St Mungos is a very much hierarchical organisation that follows a dry process to the letter without any real engagment between the candidate and interview panel.  Its clear that the organisation doesnt really care about hiring real people and finding out about them as an individual as no time or attention was given to this.  Instead its all about your competencies on paper which they assess with the drab robotic outdated situation based questions.   There was no mention of the organisations working culture nor was the information offered I had to ask about the role and the org to get anything out of the panel who seemed to just want to ask the questions they had written on the sheet and not deviate from the very formalised process.  I came out of the interview thinking why I had even bothered.  The whole experience was weird and made me feel undervalued as a person. From start to finish the process and interview panel made me feel like I was just a number going through the motions of the rigid and robotic interview process.  I definitely got the impression that St Mungos is one of those places that follows strict policy and procedure on paper to the detriment of any real human communication and interaction.  In my experience working for an organisation which places more importance on blindly following a dated and unhuman procedure over taking a more human warm and interactive process which would lead to more candidates feeling valued and respected is a big red flag.  Not a great experience. After my experience and after reading about other people's experience St Mungos don't seem to want open freethinking people working there. They want sheep who won't question senior management and who are made to feel like they are privilleged to be working for St Mungos rather than the orgnisation being lucky to have you on the team.  I did not get an offer and was not given any feedback even though they ask so much of you: from completing preinterview assessments online to  the written expercise and roleplay on the day followed by the competency interview which lasts about 1 hour.  After making people jump through hoops and they should at least offer SOME personal feedback and maybe even a phonecall to say you've been unsuccessful. Again a clear indication that this is all just a process without any real care about the indivudals behind the application.   Overall very bad experience which made me fell undervalued as a person and made me feel like a sheep being herded through this outdated interview procedure where the goal is simply to assess you without really getting to know YOU.",0.9978707,0.0019632166,0.0001660084
"I have applied for a few different positions at St Mungo's over the years (I have been with them twice plus applied for secondments and once had to apply for my own during a restructure) and their interviews are usually pretty rigorous but also pretty good in my experience they are always friendly and want to best out of you. The process has undergone a few changes over the years but at the moment the process seems to be:  Comprehension and sometimes numeracy test (online sent to you to do in your own time in the week before the interview usually takes about 15 mins it's just basic reading comprehension and it's just a small part of the picture even if someone failed this (especially if for reasons such as having English as an additional language or a learning disability) this would be unlikely to disqualify you the rest is much more important.  Interview  this usually lasts about an hour and includes a role play (which sounds scary but they give you the scenario before so you have about 5 mins to prep then after they ask you how you think that went and if you would change anything so you have an opportunity to say if you didn't feel you responded as you's wished when put on the spot) then questions. They usually start with quite hard questions and leave the 'why do you want this job?"" until the end! Most questions are scenario based  Then there is usually a written test lasting about half an hour usually a prioritisation exercise (i.e. you come in to work and here are all the tasks calling for your attention which order would you do them in and why) or a description of a hypothetical client and their situation and asked what needs you would prioritise when working with them.",0.01230831,0.9862644,0.0014272538

By far the strangest interview process for what is just a decently paid administrator position. A numerical test critical reasoning test role play admin test and panel interview. I've done my fair bit of interviews but this many methods of testing only proves that they want someone from a very particular background. What is interesting is that they issue the psychometric test and say that 'it is neither the sole or deciding factor for your application'  so why do it? Now I'm not saying I don't love a good maths test and a critical reasoning exercise but if it served no overall purpose other than to intimidate or knock the confidence off your applicants then I don't see the relevance in completing it.  The interview consisted of 6 questions fairly easy and standard.  I hadn't spent much time in their office but I couldn't see the diversity that they were championing. I'm sure its a nice place to work (can't verify that however!) but if you're up for them harbouring all this information before they have met you and sizing you up in person for only a 30 minute panel interview then please do go ahead and apply with St Mungo's.,0.6619703,0.3362682,0.0017614583

The application process consisted of around ten questions to answer online relating to experience within homelessness services: previous experience within homelessness services/supporting people.  The interview process: there was one written test to perform (an pretend email to the local council debating a decision they had made in relation to a client) I was asked to write this in  a communal area.   The interview itself: I was asked various questions relating to my experiences of working within homelessness services and the two interviewers wrote down my responses on a table they took it in turns to ask different questions each and it was a formalised process. Sometimes the interviewer replied that they had already read what I had said in my application process which threw me a little bit as the online application requires a lot of information and I used a lot of my best examples for there.,0.07658173,0.9230132,0.00040506248

I was then invited to a one on one interview which involved a 15 minute role play activity where I had to pretend I was on a telephone call and they observed me and what I chose to speak about and how I handled the phone conversation which was in regards to one of my clients trying to find suitable housing in Brighton.

Pre interview: online assessment (verbal reasoning test 8 mins to complete)  easy enough. (Read an advertisement and complete 16 true or false questions) Interview consisted of 3 partsInitially taken to a room and given a scenario (woman with bipolar disorder living at the project with an interest in attending art group. She recently admitted she no longer wants to attend the art group. Also has low self esteem lacks confidence and is isolated. I was asked to find out why she changed her mind about the art group. And how I can help her/what do I suggest I can help her with? ( you are given 15 mins to prepare for this and can take your questions into the interview which is good)  role play: one of the panel acted as the woman: I asked her about why she no longer wanted to attend and suggested I could go with her to the group to ease her into the group. Lasted 5 or so mins. After this I was asked whether there was anything else I wanted to ask my reasoning for asking the questions I did. I said that I would also enquiry about her symptoms/whether she had been complying with her medication.  interview: 3 members of panel. All very friendly. Lasted 1h and 7 or 8 questions I believe.  assessment: read a short vignette e.g mine was about a 23 year old man with a history of violence who had recently been admitted for a psychotic episode. After reading this I had to complete a risk assessment form and basically say what risk factors I can identify from the vignette (easy)  I've read a lot about how this job interview is very difficult but it genuinely wasn't that bad. Much less intimidating than I expected. So try not to overthink the many processes. The role play you are given plenty of time to prepare and can bring your answers into the interview with you.

Applied for the data verifier position in Birmingham and received a telephone interview confirmation email a couple of days later. The telephone interview was a casual conversation revolving around my CV discussing the job role in depth and answering work related questions. Interview lasted around 25 minutes.  Telephone interview questions: Are you currently employed or furloughed? What have I been doing during my time off employment? Do you have any holidays booked soon? Any criminal convictions? Why do you want to work for us? What do you know about the job role? What do you know about the company? Tell me about a time you were able to handle a repetitive workload? Tell me about a time you used your attention to detail?  If the recruiter is impressed with your overall experience she will let you know that she will move you onto the next stage of the process which will be a face to face interview with two managers/team leaders. The interview will be done from home and you have to use Microsoft Teams to do the interview. The video interview will last an hour and a half (90 minutes but could be less) and it will be with two team leaders (one asks you questions and the other makes notes). After the 30 minute interview you will have the Maths test and attention to detail test. These will last about 30 minutes.

Video interview lasts 30 minutes and then that interviewer will leave.  Second part – Maths test and attention to detail test Once the interviewer leaves the other team leader will place the question sheet on the screen for you to see and will give you half an hour to complete both activities. Due to covid you need to print out the two documents which you will need to refer to when answering all the questions. So make sure you have them! Make sure you have a pen and paper to jot down your calculations and answers because once the 30 minutes is finished the team leader will tell you to give her the answers and she will type them on the question paper. Once the test is done you finish and then she will let you know that you will receive the outcome within 5 working days).

Very long interview process for a job that pays very little. Phone interview went great and HR lady was super professional and provided feedback.

First you apply online via their online portal and fill in some boxes asking about what makes you suitable for the role.   If successful you receive an email asking you to book the appropriate time for a telephone interview.   The telephone interview has a 30 minute slot  (mine took only half that time) asking basic interview questions.   If successful at the telephone interview you are then sent a email to book a face to face interview with them.   A day before the interview I was called by recruitment and advised all the positions were now taken despite this they encouraged me to still attend as there would be future roles opening up.   The face to face interview can take up 3hrs. (Again mine took half that)  There was also a basic maths test and a calculator was provided.  In preparation I recommend studying averages  familiarising yourself with mathematic equations involving division and learning terms involving wages if you aren't familiar with them.,0.9792803,0.020423062,0.00029661038

A telephone interview with recruitment which lasts around 20 minutes followed by a 2 hour assessment centre with recruitment (including a numeracy test) followed by a face to face competency based interview with 2 team leaders.  It was so much time and effort to even get to the interview stage only to then be emailed a 'thanks but no thanks' with absolutely no feedback at all.  I have extensive experience as a debt collector and customer service advisor and I felt the interview had gone well. Overall a very draining and disappointing experience. Looking at the reviews about working for step change maybe I dodged a bullet!  All I would say is if you do not get an offer do not take it to heart it seems they are looking for a 'face that fits' which mine clearly didn't.,0.9984841,0.0013624626,0.00015348585
Application and then a short telephone interview. The interviewer wanted to do some quick background questions before going on to the main question. The first question What do you know about Stepchange? was simple to begin with I answered the question with everything I knew however this apparently was not enough. The interviewer asked me what else I knew to which I responded that this was everything. He then started to explain the charity practically saying everything I had mentioned. This situation happened a few times and it came across that the interviewer was adamant to prove that I knew nothing about the roles. I felt like I was being set up to fail.,0.16573238,0.83383024,0.00043739937
"The charity has a very selective and long winded recruitment process for a customer service job. It comprises of:  A telephone Interview  for background and experience based questions An assessment day  where you have to engage in a group task and a basic calculation test in a group of around 6 people. Interview  I got to this stage where I was no longer monitored by a qualified HR person (who I dealt with in the latter two stages) but instead by two amateur team leaders who asked me a bunch of competency based questions and had me do a task where I pretended I was an estate agent on the phone recommending a holiday.   Very long winded experience and I had spent a lot of time preparing for each step of this recruitment process consistently demonstrating my skill set and competence in working for a debt charity only to be emailed a quick ""sorry but we're not furthering your application"" with no feedback whatsoever or a number to chase them up. I spent a lot of time and energy going for this job which is frankly underneath me anyway. If they deem a masters graduate in English with plentiful customer service experience as not good enough then I don't know who is!  My advice is: Instead of letting your inexperienced team leaders make the decisions based on trivial factors (either my face didn't fit in the girl's team or she was intimidated by my skill set) get HR to do the whole process and make the decisions based on what they've seen because they're qualified enough to do so. The charity wonder why their staff turnout is so high? They're choosing the wrong people to work for them.",0.998643,0.0011991935,0.00015783047

Phone interview which was followed by a face to face interview with a basic maths test.  The face to face interview was meant to be a group interview but the other applicants couldn't make the date so I had the interview 1:1,0.004507926,0.99535096,0.00014111916
I applied online via the job portal using my CV and a cover letter.  I was invited for a telephone interview which was average in difficulty and quite laid back/informal. It's more like a chat discussing what you know about the company and why you're applying for the role. It was with one of the team leaders and they made the whole thing feel really positive and less scary than other telephone interviews I have had in the past. The interview went really well and I was invited to the group interview on the phone.  During the group interview you listen to a short presentation about StepChange and they paused often to see if anyone had any questions. I would suggest asking one or two to show some interest in what they are saying. We then moved on to the awkward ice breakers so we all knew each others names etc... After that we had to do a group activity where you organise major worldwide events in order of significance. The point of the challenge is they are all important and its up to you as group to discuss what you all feel should go where. The whole time you are carrying out this activity you are being monitored by the team leaders but in no way did it feel uncomfortable or scary. The group then has to present their order of events back to the team leaders. We then had a maths test which was relatively easy and relevant to the job role for example you would have to work out the surplus amount a person had after their wages have been spent and how much they can afford to pay off existing debt etc... you have a calculator and they provide really helpful formulas you can use to help you work it out. (Just to mention my group had 7 applicants including myself)  A week later I was invited back for my one to one interview which involved competency based questions. Again this was with the team leaders one asked the questions and the other wrote down my answers. They were your usual competency based questions and nothing that caught me off guard. I then had to do a role play telephone call with one of the team leaders. You are given six holiday recommendations and have about 10  15 mins to prepare. They then call through to you and you have to ask relevant questions during the call to whittle it down to one holiday recommendation that suits their needs.   I am waiting to hear if I have gotten the job or not fingers crossed!!!!,0.0024779427,0.99622345,0.0012985974
I applied for said job and was offered a telephone interview. I chose my preferred date and time and prepared to be called by them except they didn't call. There was no direct/office number to contact so I called the help line number who gave me a number to call. I spoke to a receptionist who said she'd find out what was going on and call me back but after an hour there was no contact. Eventually I emailed to say how unorganised and unprofessional they were to which I got a reply saying that it was a computer error which meant they didn't know I had an interview. Suffice to say I left it at that!,0.9957729,0.0040917015,0.00013547973

Filled in a very brief application. Was a text box asking why I wanted to work there. I originally applied for two positions the first one I really wanted (Debt Advisor iirc) and filled lots of info in that box and didn't even get a rejection letter! Filled in next to nothing in this box and got through to final interview. So perhaps don't waste too much time on that little box!  There was an option to upload your CV and covering letter. Though it's optional do it anyway.  Invited to a telephone interview. This was brief and basic. Can't remember what questions exactly but your standard why do you want to work here what do you know about the role what are your top three strengths? I answered communication organisation and compassion.  Invited to a group interview. Had to work with the entire interview group (8 of us I think around a large table) to figure out in a hypothetical situation which community project would get hypothetical funding. Remember to wear a watch to this! Be seen to actively be time keeping. Remind the group when there is only five minute s remaining as this will be a time exercise. Also bear in mind the point of the funding  in this case it was to give back to the community. So I suggested the one which helped the most members of the community. I also suggested we rule out the ones we didn't want. Suggest you take votes and show of hands. Include people who haven't spoken. Don't hog it all but do sit at the top of the table (power position).  At this stage there were also an 'in tray' exercise sort of... But skills based. So basically what you'll be doing in your day to day job.   Then invited to a competency based interview that was 1:1 but there were actually two interviewing one did not ask questions but just wrote your answers down. Make good eye contact with both of these people! Give clear STAR examples. Questions were a range.

I applied via an online application form which involved writing a personal statement outlining why I was suitable for the role. Around a week later I was invited for interview via email. At the interview I had to complete a 30 minute task which involved data entry / analysis on Excel and brainstorming how I would conduct a focus group with school children the things I would ask etc. I had to discuss both of this during the interview. I was in a room with one interviewer and the other called via Skype. The interview lasted about 45 minutes. I was unsuccessful and was informed of this through a telephone call three days later. They said I should have had a greater knowledge of Excel and shown a greater awareness of the role and company. However I don't believe the interview gave me the opportunity to demonstrate the research I had conducted surrounding the company. They said I should also practice the STAR technique to structure my answers which I had done so I found that pretty frustrating. However they liked my answers around team work and focus groups. Overall it wasn't a bad experience.,0.41685322,0.5826264,0.00052034506

I applied using their online form. The screening process was slow and I didn't hear that I'd been invited to interview for ~10 days although I was informed of this delay. The interview was with 2 Senior Evaluation Officers one of whom was located in another office so we used video calling (this led to some difficulties as we lost the line a couple of times when I was in the middle of an answer.   The interview also included a 30 minute task which involved some basic data analysis in Excel planning a focus group with school children and picking out some quotes from an interview transcript. It was a lot to do in 30 minutes and I messed up the Excel part a bit but the interviewers said that if I could explain what I should have differently that was fine.   The interviewers had sheets in front of them with a standard template of questions which they worked through. Most of these were the normal questions you would expect in an interview however some of them seemed to be quite poorly worded and it was hard to know exactly what the interviewers were looking for. This was particularly true for the questions around teamwork which I found quite confusing.   It was really helpful to have read some of Sustrans' reports especially because some of the questions were about what makes a good report. They seemed pleased that I had read this material.  It took a week to hear back after my interview which was longer than they had suggested and quite nervewracking. My feedback for the interview was that I hadn't demonstrated that I would be willing to consult line managers in situations where I was unsure of something. I felt that this was an unfair assessment as none of the questions had focused on this but obviously it is something that they are looking for candidates to mention.,0.974663,0.024858307,0.00047873106

Was given situational scenarios to complete in groups. This includes introducing team members creating a new idea attraction for the museum and picking certain items for a customer brief. Although the tasks were very easy I gave it my best to answer every problem fully in the most creative manner I could. Especially since it wasn’t a conventional interview standard it was difficult to prove competency.   Ultimately didn’t get the job. Wouldn’t have minded but I just feel that “dumbing down” my answers or contributing minimally would be the only possibility I had of passing the interview.    With such a informal interview approach I believe they’d already made their decisions based on application. Would have just preferred a conventional interview approach over one that doesn’t really work.   As a artist am really disappointed with the result as museums are my favourite pastime. However it has given me the initiative to focus more on monetising my art and writing and working on developing a startup business.,0.972474,0.027047286,0.0004788063
Applied online via applications portal.  I was accepted for an interview that was a short 15 minute task  to compose an email for donors which was very informative.

"Requested to make 5 slide 10 minute long presentation prior to the interview and to deliver it as though I was speaking directly to partners instead of interview panel.  I can see the value of this but it was quite contrived and a little off putting to deliver.  I have lots of public speaking experience and even drama and theatre experience and it threw me off totally. Very time consuming process and panel seemed a little inexperienced and unenthusiastic. The follow up questions were very vague and not specific to my experience nor the presentation.  ""What do you think of diversity"" and ""When have you been given a brief and how did you make sure you completed that brief""  way too broad. Valid questions and I was able to answer with lots of examples but it felt a little bit lazy.

There were three stages to the application process: first submitting the CV first round interview second round interview.  The first round interview was fine: engaged interviewers and fair questions about a project I presented.  After that things started to go downhill: I first received a rejection email and was then told that this was a mistake and that I had an interview at a time with no option to change when it was.  During the interview I was repeatedly asked to make medical recommendations despite not being medically qualified the job not being medical and none of the panel being medically qualified. This was entirely inappropriate and unethical and I have still not received any response about this after communication my concerns.  When I asked about maternity leave policies the senior member of staff was not able to answer on any details deferred the question to the only woman on the panel and then interrupted her.  Upon receiving my rejection and asking for feedback it was seemingly copied and pasted and primarily consisted of suggesting I do an unpaid internship for the organisation.,0.99829954,0.0015333821,0.00016708933

The 3stage process was made very clear before I applied. Stage 1 was submission of a CV and covering letter. Next was an online presentation over Zoom to a 3person panel incl. a few questions about your background and why you want to work there. The final leg was described as a more indepth online interview about competencies together with a data science problem that you work through while treating the panel as subject area experts.  I didn't make it to the final stage so I can't comment on that.  I received an email inviting me to interview about a month after the closing date for applications. They notified me just over 2 weeks before the interview allowing me plenty of time to prepare the 10min presentation that they requested (was not required to submit this prior to the interview date). The topic was either an algorithm that you believe is important to data science or scripts demonstrating good research software engineering practices.  Introductions with the panel were brief and friendly before launching into the presentation. They were very engaged and asked interesting questions throughout the presentation. Initially these were familiarising questions and clarified how well the models apply to the problem I'd chosen. Once we moved onto the code questions were a mix of explaining how specific functions work together with good software engineering practice questions e.g. how would you improve this section of the code (think testing variable naming documentation) how would you make this machine readable etc. At the beginning the panel advised that I could take my time to think through answers so I didn't feel rushed. Due to the number of questions the presentation took maybe 3040mins.  After that they spent a short while asking me some general questions about my work history why I wanted to work there and inviting questions from me. The entire interview ran to about an hour.  I got a response within a few days. I requested some feedback and I was impressed with the quality of the pointers they provided over email.  Overall it was a positive experience. I'd happily apply for roles there again.,0.0024182447,0.98330206,0.014279723

One round of interviews with an excel test. The interview lasted 45 minutes and was competence based.  No feedback was given on the interview itself.

I sent in a coverletter a cv a writing sample and the contact details of several references. I was contacted a few weeks later by HR to organise a 30 minute panel interview with the team. HR was responsive in regards to setting up the interview. I was interviewed by three people on the team and although I was very nervous the interviewers were friendly and made me feel at ease. I was told that the panel interview would be the entire process and I would be contacted in a week about the outcome of my application. As promised they reached out and let me know that I did not get the job. They offered that I could contact them for feedback and when I did ask for feedback they never got back to me.,0.037411284,0.95735425,0.005234469
When I arrived for the interview itself my three interviewers were generally nice and personable. Although I didn't get the job it was nice to receive feedback via telephone after the interview. However I should note a few points about the interview process.   The online interview arrangement system doesn't work well. Although I confirmed my attendance HR emailed me a few days before asking me to confirm as they hadn't seen my confirmation.   I was asked to provide my presentation 24 hours before interview which was quite a rush as it was my last week of work at another job. In the end this 24 hour deadline was not necessary as we just ended up using the version on my laptop.   Up until the moment I sat down in the interview I had not been told that there would be two interviews on separate days. Not in the job description and not anywhere in email communications had this been explained. Not a big deal but it threw me off a little. I was expecting a single interview.  Overall I would say this nice to get feedback generally nice people very disorganised application process. I would add that it felt very strange being asked to launch straight into deep technical discussion without first some niceties discussing the role itself what would be expected of me and what made me apply. Perhaps that's what the 2nd interview would have been for but if so the order of things should be reversed. Lastly  given the computational expertise available at the Turing Institute I was astounded at how useless the online application portal was.,0.98087895,0.018724393,0.00039661073

The process was simple and comprehensive. A panel of two executives interviewed me.The interview was planned for 1.5 hours and they took exactly that time not a minute more not a minute less! First 1 hour:  Relevant experience in previous jobs was discussed facing a challenge and how I overcame that challenge if I underwent organizational change during my career and how I coped with change an instance where I went over and above my job duties and why.

Very quick process from application. First interview conducted was a meeting based interview over zoom with two managers. The managers would ask questions in turn based on their behaviours. This interview was fast paced due to them running late (10 mins) with technical difficulties. You have around 4 minutes to answer per question with 7 questions in total. The interview felt less relaxed than the others I have done with them. They mentioned at the start that they are looking for exact and certain answers only which unfortunately added so much pressure.

There was a question I wasn't sure about and the panel offered to come back to it later if it suited me. But I chose not to and answered the best I could.  A lot of example based questions were asked and situational questions to test your conflict management skills.   2. The Second round was a task to be completed about the job and I was given 5 days to do it at home. It was to be emailed to the panel before the final round.  3. The final round was a teams interview with Senior members of the team 2 hiring managers and 1 panel member from the previous round. So I had a familiar face there. This was much informal and more like a chat about what the job was about and a chance to ask any questions I had.   Overall experience was lovely and I felt heard.

I applied online and filled in their form.  Pretty much standard. I was asked to do a video interview  video interview for a job that is on the phones? I don't believe in that I find it very invasive and not age appropriate for some especially those that have not been brought up in the age of technology or for those that have and can be quite self conscious with their appearance.  I was invited for an interview and wow....just wow. There were 8 of us 4 of which must have been nominated by people already working there as they were saying hello to everyone. 4 decided to take total control of the group activity not letting anyone have an opinion. This particular activity being about what you would do if stranded in the middle of nowhere.   We were then divided then in to two groups one group went to do a pretend telephone call and write an email. Coincidentally it just  happened to be the group that knew everyone at the company already.  The other group were interviewed.  My interview comprised of the interviewer not really showing much interest in my answers just looking everywhere other than at me even out of the window into the corridor to see who was passing.    One of the  questions  is why do you want to leave your job?   Another one is what is the proudest moment of your career up to date?   I might have well as talked to a brick wall.  This interviewer didn't even ask if I had any questions about the company. I knew then that I hadn't got the job.  So next a pretend game of answering the phone and writing an email and basically wasting my time. A pretend game as they had already made their decision.  A couple of days later when the email came (not a phone call) that I hadn't got the job I was not in the slightest surprised. I did ask for feed back which I was told would happen in up to 5 working days.  Yep I received the call on the last day at the very last moment possible and then when I rang back it went to the call centre and I was stuck in a very long queue for around 15 minutes until I realised that basically they just couldn't be bothered or professional enough to give me a direct line number or any feedback probably didn't like me saying I felt the interviewer was totally unprofessional . Draw your own conclusions from my experience with this company the company that cares!,0.9977102,0.0021410063,0.00014883073
I was interviewed by a Male and Female. From the moment I entered the room the female had an air of arrogance about her and was completely rude and standoffish. Throughout the interview whenever the man was asking me questions she would look at him sideways almost as though she were mocking my responses. Her questions to me were repetitive and vague  the times I asked her to elaborate or what she meant she would say just respond that it was open to my interpretation. How on earth does that make sense and give the opportunity to tailor a response to the role I am applying for?! Her attitude absolutely stunk and she is definitely not someone I would have enjoyed working underneath. There were also times were I was explaining things I had done in my previous role and team to which she constantly made sarcastic remarks to her colleague interviewing me such as “oh it sounds like we’re in the wrong job”. There were also questions where I was specifically asked about my previous role and when I responded she asked “who is we? You say we a lot”  well considering I was a part of one of the largest companies in the entire U.K. and working within a team my answer will include a “we” since I didn’t run the entire section singlehandedly.  Totally impossible to feel comfortable being interviewed by her and quite frankly for a temporary position the need to be interviewed in such a hostile environment was totally unnecessary. Wish I saw all these Glassdoor reviews before agreeing to attend the interview.  I was also required to do a written test which didn’t factor into account the need to read four pages of information before completing the task and also the fact that they said the test had started and then proceeded to talk to me about an impending fire alarm and give me an emergency phone number to contact if the laptop died cutting down the time to do the task even further. But as I said from the outset the female interviewer had such a bad body language and energy towards me constantly giving me dirty looks than she no doubt did this on purpose and didn’t care that I would run out of time.,0.99874914,0.001097951,0.0001528142

"Initial communication was made via email from the recruiting team with information about the interview on 30th May at 11am and the format. Stage 1) was to deliver a 15 mins facilitation session on one of the Guinness Partnership core behaviours. On the day I did the session on ""take responsibility"". This was delivered to the panel members the Group HR Director and the outgoing Learning Partner who both appeared welcoming and friendly (as you would do in interviews). Stage 2)was followed by an hour long interview by the above personnel starting with why I liked the job my background what I had done before.  Each took turn to ask a number of competency based questions. At the end I was offered the opportunity to ask questions. These I came prepared with.  On ending my questions I asked 'what was the next step  when would I hear the outcome?"" I was told the following week because they had more interviews including for the Head of Learning & Development who the Learning Partner would report to. The week came and went so I assumed I did not get the job and I moved on. To date neither the HR Dept nor the recruitment team have not demonstrated their core value to ""deliver great customer service"" and let me know that I did not get the job and allow me to ask for feedback on the outcome.  This behaviour is far from their strap line which says ""....we believe that how we do things is as important as what we do"". I view as unprofessional. It left a bad impression of the HR Dept and the end stages of their recruitment communication process. They clearly need to refresh themselves on their  behaviours which should also impact the recruitment interviews and selection process.   Pay particular attention to the following behaviours 1) deliver great customer service 2) work together to communicate 4) take responsibility 6) are professional and 'principled'.

Stage Two  a 30 minute task to develop a topline digital comms strategy for a new online service followed by a 1015 minute presentation to two managers on my approach key messages and measurements of success. This was followed by a few more questions about previous campaign experience management style and attitude towards content development.  It was a really smooth process  I was kept informed by the recruitment team and the timelines for each stage of interview and onboarding were made really clear.

The other person who was then told he had in fact not been successful submitted a complaint (righly so) I was then told I had to go for another interview after being investigated and interviewed about how my first interview had gone which was very stressful!

I was let into the building by a buzzer but no one came to greet me nor was I told where to go so I had to look and ask around myself before finally finding the interviewers and some other colleagues in the kitchen having a chat they were completely unprepared and left me alone in the kitchen while they went off to find a room for us to interview in. Being that I spent the first 10 minutes in the kitchen I was surprised when I wasn't even offered a drink. I was then taken to a small dark office (they didn't even put the light on) sat on a single tiny chair at the back of the room while my two interviewers sat at a computer desk with their backs to me so they could write at the desk. They then proceeded to ask me 14 questions 7 each. There was absolutely no eye contact throughout my interview as both of them were writing at the same time. I find it hard to connect with people's backs. I gave short/half answers simply because I felt like I had to wait for them to finish what they were writing and turn around and look at me so I could continue.

Chaotic and unbelievably silly. Will accept almost anyone who shows up so desperate they are to fill many posts let empty by sudden departures.

150 candidates for 6 jobs... There is no pre assessment centre phone screening which would have been the most logical way to start the process so as not to invite so many people down to Swindon. Instead they invite 150 odd people across two days from all corners of the country out of your own pocket with no reimbursement(£120 train return).  On the day there is no real structured 1 to 1 or opportunity to speak to a panel of assessors away from the interruptions of other pushy candidates.  The day itself is a bit lax and not as strict or challenging as most assessment centres are. There were several tasks throughout the day the first of which was a quiz styled around the National Trust and itself as an organisation.. More of a trivia type thing than any actual competency to the role.  This was followed on by some talks; one of the tasks was the classic rank 10 set items in order of importance according to the US coast guard to help you survive a shipwreck in the Atlantic ocean.  The final task which was a bit out there involved crafting your favourite National Trust property from play doh and then speaking about the property for 5 odd minutes and what it means to you and why it's so good.   I understand this was only the second year of doing this on the end of the National Trust however as an organisation as big as this the process shouldn't have been so amateurish.  Good luck in the future there's a lot to be learnt when recruiting your future grads.,0.9745107,0.02451037,0.0009788012
Application was online  straightforward process. They got in touch with only 2 days prior to the interview date which led to some manic preparation. Interview consisted of about 2 hours: 1 hour of 2 written exercises followed by 45 min interview with panel. Staff were friendly throughout which helped to put me at ease. For the written exercises I was asked to respond to an email complaint and then create a business plan to improve on 3 areas of the organisation. Interview felt friendly and relatively informal  felt able to be a bit more relaxed. The panel were polite and allowed time for questions at the end  they made me want to work there.,0.0030348152,0.070995666,0.92596954
Completed an application form covering letter and two 500 word questions online. After about a week I was invited to an interview.  The interview began with short presentation about my favourite NT property then two interview question a tour of the grounds and group activities. For the first group task were were split into two teams of three and asked to build the tallest tower from leaflets (looking for teamwork and communication skills). The second task was to go through a list of 15 objects and choose 7 that would help us survive as a team in a jungle (looking for teamwork and presentation skills). After these group task there was a written exercise. We were given 10 minutes to answer three questions regarding a hypothetical family buying NT membership: What should they do today while visiting the property? What membership would be best for them? What properties should they visit when they return home to North Wales? This concluded the interview  I was told I would hear back by the end of the week and was offered the job over the phone that evening. I declined the job as I was waiting to hear back from other applications.,0.063826576,0.93581885,0.00035464822

1. Send off an online application form which is accessed through an online sign in process on their website.  The National Trust website already states it will take up to three weeks to let you know if you have been successful for a face to face interview.  They got back to me in a week and a half to invite me to interview.   2. Invited to a face to face interview with a task about how you would handle different scenairo on your own   The face to face interview was in a small room interviewed by two people this felt very informal and also impractical layout of the room Which lead me to feeling uncomfortable. They tried to outline the job role at the beginning but was still very confused in what the job role would entail. Only by the end of the interview did I seem to understand what they wanted this person to cover in the role. The two people interviewing started off stating they were looking for slightly different answers to the questions. Additionally was not clear on really who you would be line managed by if offered the job.   When I answered questions at times I was challenged about the answer but almost felt like I was being bullied or not believed.

Highly structured consisting of 4 different activities a group exercise a 1to1 interview a marketing written exercise and a visitor feedback written exercise. There were 8 candidates interviewing for 1 position over 2 different sessions.  Some candidates were already working for the National Trust which gave them a distinct advantage especially in the group exercise and in the 1to1 interview questions.  The National Trust states that it appoints on merit and this is shown in the interview process and the way that your answers are scored by a number of different people. This interview process is pretty dry it is not about how you work or you as a person it is purely about hitting the right words for the scoring system.

"Very rushed was not greeted by anyone at the reception or told that the interview was held in a room about a 15 minute walk from the reception up a hill so had to find it on my own and arrived quite flustered. Entered with all my belongings and the manageress interviewing me didn´t give me any time to sit down and get comfortable but immediately laid out a preinterview activity although I had arrived 10 minutes early and hadn´t been told this would be happening.   Rest of the interview was with two manageresses one was fine and the other of the main site who had given me the activity rushed through and was fairly bolsh. She was wearing an extremely low cut top which I found extremely unprofessional and made me feel really uncomfortable. She also asked me questions about how I would provide a great friendly customer service when she was providing none of that herself at all. She rushed through the questions and when I had answered my last one she stood up and said ""Thanks for coming"" before the other interviewer could say ""Hang on do you have any questions to ask us?"". Felt like I was just one of a number on a conveyor belt she had to get through and she made it clear she was quite tired. Tried to make friendly chit chat but she wasn´t interested and I got sent out of the room not knowing where to head to (I needed the toilets but she closed the door behind me in such a rush couldn´t get me out of there fast enough it seems...)   I then didn´t hear anything for a week and emailed her to ask if the position had been filled. She just said she had been very busy and gave no apology but no I hadn´t got the job.

After my interview I was told I would hear back by the end of the week. They did not get back to me by the end of the week so I waited for Monday. Still no word from them so I decided to chase them up via email. Two days later they still hadn't responded to my email. I then called for an update to be told I need to email them (even though I already did that.) Anyway I emailed again and they finally told me I hadn't been successful. I studied for about 2 weeks for this interview and I really wanted the job. In hindsight I am glad I didn't get the job as the lack of professionalism in them getting back to me is quite telling of their character.  They also would not supply any feedback which I think is unfair and hinders us job seekers.

The most positive interview experience I have ever had. The job was posted end of December 2020 and I started in my new role on 17th February so the entire process felt very efficient especially the timeline once it was actually in the hands of the Marketing Manager. I was called the day after my interview and offered the job and I started exactly three weeks later (to allow for equipment and tech set up) which I felt was an incredibly speedy timeline.   The interview was done by the marketing manager and the director of business development which felt like an amazing amount of attention for an assistant role and both were very friendly and welcoming and I felt at ease as soon as I joined the call. In fact I was actually unsuccessful in an application for a more senior role but rather than a rejection I was asked to interview for a more suitable role (considering this is my first grad job).  I found the actual interview a genuinely enjoyable experience which is a rare thing to be able to say  I was asked to create a presentation with some specific details and I felt it really gave me a chance to show what I could do with my own creative touch. The interview questions were fairly standard and nothing felt out of the blue or not applicable to the role I was applying for. I also felt supported to find the right answer which was lovely so if I didn't answer the exact question it was rephrased so I was given the chance to give the best answer possible.   Overall a fantastic experience and I'm now in my second week of work and the onboarding and induction process is so thorough and welcoming especially considering the challenges we're all experiencing working from home.,0.0004909471,0.0017801627,0.9977289
I had a remote (Teams) interview for The Vegan Society in Nov 2020. While the interview was set up by an outsourced HR company I was interviewed by two senior members of staff from the Comms Dept who were both friendly warm and welcoming. I find remote interviews can be particularly challenging as you don't always get a sense of the company job or potential colleagues but I felt very much at ease. The process was quite long  I think about 1hr 15 mins  but I did talk a lot. I've had interviews for similar roles previously but enjoyed this one the most. I loved that they took the time to explain more about the company the office space and how they were working during the pandemic. It was one of those interviews where I came away fully confident in what was expected of me but also the benefits I could get in return. They went into detail about the role and the requirements so nothing really came as a surprise when I started. The interview also included some practical assessments including a practice radio interview (as the role required being a spokesperson on behalf of the company). After the interview I was called by the HR company who explained when I would hear back and also further questions about start dates/holidays/pay etc.,0.017390208,0.6017862,0.3808236
The application process took just over 2 months in total from seeing the job advertised to filling in the application form to getting an interview and then hearing back about the job. I think this is a fair timeline for a small charity. The interview was held remotely via Teams because of the current situation. The interview lasted about an hour and included a short presentation at the beginning followed by 6 competency questions and then general HR questions.   The interviewers were friendly and approachable. I felt that I understood the job description and the tasks asked because of how well they interviewed.,0.007553872,0.33706436,0.6553818
I applied online via an application form.  After the closing date I had an email followed by a phone call with the recruitment officer who explained the process and offered me a formal interview date.  I was then scheduled to meet for a formal interview with two senior members of the communications team.  During the interview I was given a management skills question test to answer and given 30 minutes to compile my answer/plan of action. We then talked through my POA followed by them asking me a series of competencybased interview questions including questions related to The Vegan Society. All members of staff I came into contact with were friendly and approachable I felt a positive and welcoming atmosphere. I was contacted a week later to say I had a successful interview and I was offered the job which was fantastic news.,0.00032238642,0.0027723692,0.99690527
I applied for two jobs at the Vegan Society.  After my first interview I was asked back for a second interview so clearly it went well! For the second interview I was sent a whole pages' worth of brief for a task I had to complete. It was called ‘the pros and cons of various staff time recording systems’.  It didn’t explicitly state that there would be more interview questions and considering the size of the task I thought that would be the main deciding factor. So I spent all day every day for a week on this presentation.   There did end up being further interview questions however and I was told I didn’t get the job because I didn’t answer the questions sufficiently which seemed perfectly fair but it made me realise that the presentation actually had little to do with the decisionmaking process.  The interviewers even said during the interview that a staff time recording system is something that they were actually going to implement for the charity so this makes me think that they were just taking advantage of hopeful candidates by getting them to do their research for them. They even asked me to send them a copy of my presentation 'to make sure it worked on their computer system when i got there to present it' which they clearly didn't because it didn't work when i got there. So why did they ask me to send it over?    There were delays throughout the whole process including after the interview for the second role. I sent two emails politely requesting some feedback after it was clear I hadn’t got the job. My emails were ignored and after the whole difficult process I was a little irritated. This led me to email again pointing out I had been ignored; I got an immediate email and a phone call back! Telling me that as a vegan I should understand that she didn't have time to reply to candidate emails and not complain.   I get the impression from talking to those involved and from the other reviews on this website that  because the Society does good work for the animals they feel they have an excuse to treat people badly.,0.9954006,0.0043655112,0.00023387352
I was interviewed by a panel of two at The Vegan Society's office in Birmingham. I gave a presentation and afterwards there were six or seven questions. The interview took place on a Friday and I was told that I would be informed of the outcome by the end of the day or at the latest on the Monday immediately after the weekend. In fact I was never informed of the outcome and I when I sent a followup email this was ignored.  I travelled to the interview all the way from Brighton at my own expense (they did not offer to reimburse travel expenses) and had to take a day off work from my current job to attend. I consider the fact that they did not bother to inform me of the outcome to be extremely unprofessional and rude especially given the fact that I also had to prepare a presentation for the interview. The Vegan Society's lack of response is the main impetus behind this negative review although I would also add that I was not impressed by their office which was untidy and the general appearance and attitude of the staff which did not inspire great confidence in their professionalism.,0.99892634,0.0009176883,0.00015603578
The process was initially completing an application form which request responses to specific questions as a means of demonstrating prior experience.

The interview was relaxed the two ladies made me feel at ease straight away I genuinely answered there questions and they had told me I must meet their essential criteria.

The first activity at the assessment centre was to work in teams and build giraffes using newspaper tape scissors and a stapler. At certain points teams had to swap and continue working on the giraffe of another team. Afterwards there were lots of activities e.g. discussing how we would react to situations that could potentially come up on placement. There were a couple of facilitators and lots of staff just sitting around taking notes. Then there was an individual interview part with the usual questions in a chilled and friendly mood. At the end we had to come up with a presentation of what we learned during the day.,0.0003686115,0.9919863,0.0076451725

Straightforward process with 3 stages. First screening interview was just as expected with usual questions (what excites you about this job why WaterAid etc). This was with the hiring manager and current team member who were really friendly and made me feel at ease straight away. Following the screening I was given a problem statement and a week or so to create a presentation on an idea to generate more income for WaterAid. I was also given 7 questions in advance to prepare answers. These covered topics like how to measure innovation experience with prototyping what support I would need to thrive in the role. Although the presentation required quite a lot of prep I appreciated having the time to prepare answers and having the bulk of the interview process done in one go. The final interview was with the head of department and hiring manager. Again they were very friendly and it felt like a twoway conversation where I could really get to grips with what life at WaterAid would be like and what they were looking for. In this interview we covered a bit more about my previous experience and skills what I might find challenging about the role.,0.0023642874,0.96434826,0.033287458
This was a temporary role for 68 weeks so it was an informal chat the interviewer was very pleasant and did advise I would hear that day which was a Friday as they wanted someone to start the following week. I checked my emails all day eager to know if I had work I then chased my agency towards the end of the day only to find they were going to make a decision on the Monday now. I could understand further deliberation for a permanent role but I had to wait anxiously the whole weekend not knowing. I then had to chase this again on Monday and found out late afternoon that I didn’t get it. It was quite a junior role and I have a lot of experience so did ask for feedback as that would be helpful to me going forward to know where I went wrong. Never received any feedback. All very disappointing and I wouldn’t be encouraged to apply again in the future off the back of this sadly.,0.97822785,0.021465946,0.00030620897
It was straight forward. The women were nice. I didn’t get the job but I didn’t mind too much. The questions were your standard questions no presentation or anything which was preferable for me.,0.00087296235,0.99799746,0.0011294549

"I was invited for a 11 interview with the hiring manager. General questions were asked about my previous experience and why I wanted to join the organisation.

Initially I didn’t make it through the application process but was reached out to by the hiring manager to say there had been a mistake meaning that I had a couple of days to prepare for the interview. The interview involved around 10 questions and a presentation on a specialist area of WaterAid. Some of the questions required the same answers and were worded just a little bit differently. The interviewees seemed polite and nice however the hiring manager turned their camera off (on both rounds) so that was a bit disconcerting when interviewing as it was hard to pick up on body language. I made it through to the second round and it was another load of questions and a task that according to the hiring manager would usually be shared prior to interview but they wanted to know a gut reaction. I answered as best as I could and then was later informed that I wasn’t chosen. I completely understand not being chosen it’s a competitive field. What concerned me was the language and reasoning behind why I wasn’t chosen. The phrasing was “If it was a different region it could have been a different story” this is open to a lot of interpretation and so I followed up asking for feedback. The hiring manager asked if she could share this with me after her leave I asked if it could be done beforehand as I have other interviews lined up and would really like to learn where I can improve I received the hiring managers out of office. It has now been a week since the hiring manager has returned from leave and just over two weeks since the interview I’ve still not received any feedback. Considering the time and preparation they expect from a candidate to put into an interview this is really poor form. The people who I had spoke to in interview had been working at WaterAid for 10years and I can’t help but believe they have forgotten what it is like to be on the other side and just how valuable feedback is to a candidate. I later learned from a friend I have in the sector that someone has joined WaterAid recently and has been in tears daily from the pressure. So perhaps it was a blessing in disguise that I didn’t get the role!,0.9931821,0.0066140443,0.00020382483
"Application process was over 3 months long(over 2 months longer than expected) which included a telephone interview with the training provider an excel test(including a casestudy) and a video interview with two senior finance members.  Long story short I was given the job offer however a few days after the offer they sent me an erroneous contract length which I disputed and then they subsequently pulled my job offer. My contract was meant to be 36 months(as mentioned in their own JD) yet they offered me a mere 18 months. They later told me that they would fix it and then offered me 30 months. I asked if it would be possible to get my full 36 months and they pulled my job offer.    I later pursued a case with ACAS since I believed there was a breach of contract and sure enough WaterAid were ordered to give me compensation for pulling my job offer without giving me any notice despite me having already accepted the job offer.   They claim to be a ""great place to work"" yet they are unaware of  any employment laws; a truly clueless and incompetent People's Team and an equally arrogant Financial Management Team.

The telephone screen was really positive and the interviewer was very friendly whilst maintaining a level of professionalism.

There were two interviewers with one whom I found to be particularly abrupt and unfriendly.  Whilst I totally agree with competency interviews I believe these can be run with a level of engagement friendliness and create an environment where people would like to come and work there.  I would have left the interview in the first 15 minutes and found myself becoming more disengaged as it went on with the aim to just get through it.

"It was a standard phone profiling interview ..one of those where they are somewhat wasting your precious time. Asking what research experience you have for a research role shows lack of understanding from the HR recruiter. You don't ask an IT expert if they can use a keyboard so don't be asking what experience a researcher has in carrying out interviews or survey methods...it's a given. No challenge whatsoever this form of interviewing from their HR dept as a 1st screen. It also smacks that of them not reading your CV or covering letter as what they asked on the phone was what I had already described in my application. As a highly qualified how do you expect me to reply 'tell me what experience in data analysis do you have?'...probably more experience than the questioner has had in hot dinners!   The HR recruiter also asked about salary expectations. They advertised ""circa £xx.000"". So I stated a 10% ....to which the HR interviewer reeled off the benefits package...and was reluctant to offer more than the stated circa salary figure. Shows poor understanding of recruitment as they should advertise 'circa' if their budget doesn't allow for more. I suspect this so the reason I wasn't taken forward to the next round.   All in all a complete waste of time...mine and theirs.",0.99866295,0.0011827976,0.00015425916

"A really illmanaged and disappointing interview experience.  Applied online and was invited to interview with instructions to prepare a presentation around a specific project. Searched everywhere online and found no information for this project so emailed them and asked if it was made up. they replied back just two days before the interview saying   ""it refers to a project we are scoping so there isn’t detail yet available on the website""  I then asked her to send me information on it so I could prepare my presentation which she did do so without apology or acknowledgement that a task was set for a candidate that would have been impossible without this missing information.  A critical oversight on their part.  Another issue was that they removed the job description from their website right after the deadline. This meant that I was forced to prepare based on my memory of what was in it and where  I had thankfully copied and pasted some parts on to a document when I was applying.  The interview itself was over an hour long. Questions were difficult but more or less what I  expected. After the interview however I heard nothing for two weeks despite being told that I would be informed of a decision in just a  few days. Sent a follow up email and got no response. Waited for 2 weeks before eventually without thinking logging on to my online portal where I had submitted my application and it was there I saw that they had rejected me. No opportunity was provided to me to get feedback. This is probably the worst way I've been informed of an interview outcome.   I'm left with a really bad impression of Wellcome. Though in the media they portray themselves as always looking out for the well being of staff and the general public they certainly do not adopt best practice when it comes to candidates they interview.",0.998808,0.0010536097,0.00013837522

Two weeks after the interview I received an automated rejection email which indicated I could ask my HR contact for feedback. I emailed HR and again heard nothing.

Applied online 3 weeks later I got an invitation to their Woking office (no recruiter/HR called before that). I was offered a few time slots to choose from all on the same day. There was a task in the email: make a presentation about the ideal future strategy of supporter experience and how to have a strong voice within WWF. I did the presentation in person for a panel of 3 managers/dept.heads (no HR) in a relaxed atmosphere although it felt they were not very experienced interviewers (read all questions word by word from a paper). They seemingly liked my ideas and recommendations took a lot of notes and then they moved to competencybased questions but many of those could not really be expected from what was included in the job description. After almost 2 hours I was let go and I have never heard from them again (this was 2 months ago). Their only email came from a noreply address so I could not even followup.

The hiring process was going to be a two stage interview process and this was made clear at the start of the first interview (following successful shortlisting via applications). The first interview went reasonable well with the panel attentive and friendly. I the received an email to say I had not been successful at this stage. This was then followed by an email later on the week that I was invited to a second stage interview. I clarified this with the recruitment team and then arranged a time for the 2nd interview. My task was to prepare a presentation for the panel. The panel at the second stage were uninterested and generally the experience was cold compared to the panel at the first stage. I did not hear anything following the interview. After a couple of weeks I chased up with the recruitment team and I got no response. After over a month I finally received an automated message to inform me that I had been unsuccessful and not shortlisted for the next stage. I was not aware of a third stage! I was really disappointed that after the time devoted to preparing for the interviews and task I was completely blanked and not given an opportunity to even ask for feedback.

Unfortunately this is one of the worst hiring experiences I have had. They took over a month to send an automated email inviting me for an interview. The message had several errors stating it was my 2nd interview when it was my first saying I would get a zoom link 48 hours before and asking me to prepare a presentation with a very vague one line title. I'm lucky I checked the platform an noted this presentation request as the email had no mention of it. They should really make it more clear.  I didn't receive any zoom link up until the day of my interview and rang emailed recruitment several times. They did not respond all morning nor to the email I had sent a week before and only phoned me up 5 minutes into my supposed interview to say they couldn't find the link. 15 minutes and another phone call later they found it and got it to me. So I ofcourse entered my interview late. If I had not rang them so many times I would have missed out on my interview. The interviewer apologised and said they were switching HR systems which was why that happened. I was only asked 6 very basic questions. There were two interviewers (despite my email saying I was speaking to one). This other individual had an angry face the entire interview and was fairly short in her communication. There seemed to be tension in the air.  I gave my presentation to which they had no feedback apart from saying they liked it and highlighting an idea they liked in particular and thought would be good to implement. When I asked about the timeline of when I should expect to hear back (as I was ofcourse job searching and was expecting another offer but I let them know this role at WWF was my preferred role) they were quite guarded about it and said likely 2 weeks but if I wanted to withdraw I should email them. I told them I had no intention to withdraw as I loved the sound of the job I just wondered if they had a timeline. I found this quite defeatist and any other interviewer I have asked for a timeline has always been more forthcoming often even saying to let them know if I needed an answer sooner and they'd try if possible. The interview was then ended. I never heard back from them despite and saw they marked me as unsuccessful on the recruitment platform without giving me any notification or feedback. After following up they told me this was again due to their HR system.  The process was a complete mess and I came out feeling short changed by them making me late to the interview which ofcourse threw me off a little. For a charity I really did not get a good vibe or that they care very much about staff. It is really sad to treat potential employees this way particularly when the job market is harder than usual during the pandemic. From other Glassdoor reviews it seems clear ghosting is common for them and they're not particularly good with potential hires. So I hope if this happens to you atleast know not to take it personally. Part of making the planet a better place is being pleasant to others and efficient  two things they fell very short on.,0.9978346,0.0020213395,0.00014402854

Short presentation with follow up questions and broader questions regarding myself and WWF missions. Specific questions on my opinion on issues relating to the role.   I appreciated the opportunity for an interview but the process was incredibly time consuming  one to keep on the back burner.,0.9954531,0.004416646,0.00013016106
The interview lasted around 4560 minutes. The interviewers were really lovely and responsive and said they'd get back to me within a week. Two weeks went by and I received no emails. I messaged HR and got a template email which they didn't even insert my name or the job position into. I was really disappointed that they failed to even reject me kindly despite everyone at the building being extremely welcoming and kind. The email has really left a bad taste in my mouth.,0.99135405,0.007891419,0.00075451436
I heard back from my application within 2 weeks (though this was a particularly quick recruitment) and attended an interview in person. I was asked to prepare a technical presentation and was asked mainly competency based questions. Three interviewers two from the team and one as objective interviewer. I also met a team member before the interview for a tour and informal chat which was also part of the interview (though not explicitly so). Received a decision within a couple of days. Salary wasn't negotiable.,0.0011966429,0.99119276,0.0076105883
The interview process was very thorough 2 step interview. The first consisted of an introductory set of questions about my background which were then followed competency based questions about how I would react to certain situations. My answers were based on my previous work experience and what I knew about the communications industry.   I then had to do an hour long written test where I read a detailed report on an environmental project before producing a press release.   I was then invited back for the second and final round of interviews shortly afterwards. For the second round I had to prepare a presentation which looked at an environmental situation and how I would go about trying to influence the key players via the media. The presentation was 5 minutes long and was followed by the same sort of competency questioning that happened during the first interview.   The whole process was very positive although I found my prospective boss (who was there during the second round of interviewing) to be dismissive and quite rude (an interview tactic no doubt),0.07059187,0.92775327,0.001654825
The initial online application is incredibly comprehensive. They provided a timescale as to when they'd make a decision and when the interviews would take place which they honoured. I was called to a face to face interview within a few weeks of my application. I've always wanted to work for the WWF and was really excited. I put a lot of thought in to my application and spent a long time preparing for the face to face interview.  The interviewers had scripted interview questions which they did not deviate from presumably to ensure all candidates experience the same interview. All the interviewers seemed incredibly bored throughout the entire process. At the end of the interview I was informed a decision would be made and I would be notified within one week.  My interview ran from 9am  10 am. When I left the interview I checked my phone and noted receipt of an automatically generated email at 9.32am confirming my unsuitability for the role. The email also confirmed that due to the large volume of applicants they couldn't provide specific feedback.   I'm really not sure why they wasted my time and theirs by interviewing me. I'd have been less offended with a straight out rejection. My interview felt like a boxticking exercise to demonstrate their own compliance with their recruitment process but have left me feeling they have showed a lack of professional courtesy.,0.9966875,0.0029841764,0.00032840113
The window for job applications was short  only 2 weeks.  I submitted my application with a week to spare and was then emailed the day after the applications closed to ask me to come along to an interview.  The interviews were the following week and you could use the online system to choose a time of day that suited you for the interview. I was told ahead of time that I needed to give a 5minute presentation on a topical and controversial wildlife conservation issue that they had specified. The interview itself went well.  There were three members of staff interviewing me including the direct line manager her manager and a manager that works closely with them in a different department.  They were all very friendly and nice and put me at ease from the beginning. We started off with my 5min presentation and I then had to answer some technical questions about the topic of the presentation afterwards. Following that I was asked some more indepth questions about my specific skills and experience related to the job and how I would fit into the role and use this experience to benefit the organisation. The interview lasted approximately 1 hour including a few questions that I asked at the end. The line manager then called me up a few hours later and offered me the job!,0.0030997836,0.6093742,0.387526
This job was based in the U.K. The application process had positives and negatives. I'll start with the negatives: The application process took a really long time  I didn't hear that I had been offered an interview until three weeks after the application deadline had passed.  I was notified of the interview two weeks before the interview date but wasn't told the outcome of the interview until a week after the interview had taken place. From the initial application deadline to being told I was not  being taken to the second round of interviews took around 42 days. The other downside was that recruitment never answered any of my emails when I had requested information on one or two occasions. For example before applying I had requested more information about the job role but nobody got back to me.  The positives were that everyone I met at WWF UK on the day of the interview were very friendly from the reception staff to everyone on the interview panel. The three interviewers seemed very nice and did their best to make me feel at ease.   The interview itself was different to how I had expected there were no waffley questions such as 'tell me about yourself' or 'describe yourself in three words' or 'why would you be the best person for this job' or 'what animal would you be'  none of that. All the questions were very specific and wanted to get straight to the heart of my experience and exactly what relevant experience I had and how I had gone about it. They wanted clear examples of relevant experience and wanted to find out my understanding of how things (i.e. project management or stakeholder negotiation) should be done. There didn't seem to be much room for talking about other skills and experience or trying to elaborate on why I could be best for the job. This is the part I found difficult  I was quizzed in some detail about very specific experience but there was little room to 'show off' in other areas or tell them about other things I had done or achieved or additional skills I had. I also had to do a 5 minute (preprepared) presentation. The topic set by WWF was the impacts of trophy hunting on wildlife conservation. As this was a Technical Adviser role (which would involve giving expert wildlife conservation advice)  candidates were expected to have a strong knowledge of conservation science hence the technical nature of the presentation.  My experience may not be typical of WWF interviews for other job roles  I suppose different interview panels ask different questions so an interview for an HR or Communications position would likely be completely different.,0.98263794,0.01706975,0.00029235796
The interview was very relaxed and more of like a conversation.I was briefed about the software's and the Hr systems in use.  Nothing intense very generic questions about my previous work experience and how I would handle situations and scenarios.  Overall a very relaxed interview. :),0.0014013969,0.9648545,0.03374411
