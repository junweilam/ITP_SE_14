This leads to managers essentially contracting out the work their staff could do to second-rate agencies who charge a fortune for generic products and services they sell to every charity. One example whilst working there, an agency sold a renamed version of a customer marketing funnel for hundreds of thousands of pounds to attract new regular givers. The final number of new givers was less than 10.\r\n\r\nSome middle managers hold a lot of power but are effectively running the charity into the ground. Anyone who challenges the status quo is usually forced out. I saw 3 separate people leave by mutual agreement with a payout and NDA in my time there.\r\n\r\nThe CEO is well out of his depth. He talks passionately about the charity (and often name drops famous/successful friends), but isn't able to put that into action. There was no well defined strategy or vision whilst I was there, just a few lines about how the last decade was bad for children and the next decade should be good. He has also given more power and responsibilities to directors and managers who have failed year after year.

This organisation has the most biased HR department I have ever come across. If you keep your head down and do what your line manager and senior managers tell you to do (even if it's wrong), then you'll be OK! They want automated machines, that don't have a voice, solely so they don't have to do much work. Woe be you if you ever do speak up against anyone higher than you - it is insinuated you are a liar (if branding people as witches was still acceptable, they'd use that)! Because, you know, anyone in a senior position always tells the truth and have the best interests of their team members at heart... ! I think that is what HR are banking on, which makes them very naive, or they just have no desire to actually help people.\r\n\r\nHR are completely biased towards the senior staff's views and leave things for them to deal with in regards to their team members. Everything is 'at the manager's discretion', which is such a cop-out way of saying 'HR can't be responsible for anything'. It seems like all they want to do is sit in their area and not actually take any action in regards to any HR issues. They take the view of the managers, and don't even think/wish to deal with the charge in question. The manager's word is final, and if you disagree, you are made to feel like you're either a liar, incompetent, just plain confused, imagining it, or all of the above.  \r\n\r\nThere is also a lack of structure and an inconsistency with the staff handbook across departments. Of course, everything is 'at the manager's discretion', so how can it be reinforced?! It isn't. There is one rule for one and one rule for another, and there are no set standards for anything. Of course there is an 'official' staff handbook, and this is readily available for everyone, but it isn't reinforced across departments. If a 'complaint' is made against a staff member about something, yet other department members are doing the same, one will be disciplined and the other not. Completely unfair culture. HR don't even want to know - it's 'at the manager's discretion', remember!  If it's brought up, their discipline is at their manager's discretion. \r\n\r\nI recently had a 1-2-1 training session with a member of HR, and I mentioned that, in hindsight, what was being taught wasn't relevant to me, so suggested we shouldn't carry on, but was made to feel like I had deliberately wasted their time, was completely ungrateful and that their knowledge on the subject being discussed/taught was paramount, so I was an idiot giving up this 'opportunity'. Needless to say, I stuck out the remainder of these sessions, just so I have something on my CV and to shut the HR person up (they thought very (too) highly of themselves, so I didn't want the aggravation).  \r\n\r\nThere is now a new dept head, but it has yet to seen if there will be any change to how the department is run/supposed to fulfil it's duties.
