It is literally depressing to have to be in that space everyday (even if you have friends there, I imagine it would be intolerable without any). There is NO oral communication and everything is done through digital channels. If you do try to talk or chat, even in the kitchen area, management will complain about you.\r\n- Very low salary. Expected at an NGO, but this organisation will actively take steps to pay you as little as possible, and still expects everyone to work from the (obviously expensive to access) London office. \r\n- They mainly hire only very young and inexperienced people. This is because there is absolutely no interest in hearing ideas or innovation from staff, you are simply expected to be the dogsbody who will carry our their outdated strategies that come directly from the U.S. and the Director Ingrid Newkirk. Because of this, there are almost no learning opportunities.\r\n- No scope for growth or progression (even if you push for it) beyond minor vanity promotions (slightly changed title and tiny pay increase). They would rather hire a new staff member in your place that they can pay minimum wage than promote you. Staff are just numbers to them, the cheaper the better. \r\n- Constant turnover. They also create and change roles constantly without informing the team until the new staff member(s) arrive, leaving you unsure where you stand. \r\n- No job security. I saw people dismissed (with immediate effect) simply because they are not liked by \"favoured\" colleagues or the management. These are people who gave up real careers and prospects to dedicate their time to the cause for animals. Some people also have their probations extended seemingly endlessly. \r\n- You are not given feedback, but rather there is gossip amongst management that you eventually find out about.\r\n- I had managers make inappropriate comments about my personal life and even spread this invented gossip amongst colleagues. I am more than up for some banter .etc, but it was beyond that. \r\n- You write a \"weekly report\" with detailed information on every task you completed. This gets sent all the way up through management chains to Ingrid Newkirk, who apparently reads them all. Whilst reporting on progress is normal, this system is just weird. \r\n- Management are surely aware of all these issues and their constant staff turnover, but do not care or act.

They also take ownership of victories of other organisations when it's a collective effort really, especially since sending out petitions and organising 5-minute demonstrations in the street just to get media coverage does not require huge amounts of donations.

No consideration shown to staff who struggled with the low temperature to the point where they couldn't focus on their work. Staff are forbidden from using one exit of the office purely because PETA President said they should walk through the office and say goodbye to everyone when they leave. Junior staff called into a patronising meeting and ordered not to leave any clutter on their desks. Serious lack of diversity in the office. I only saw one non-white employee when I was there. As others have said, \"the animals have it worse\" is used to justify overworking staff and expecting them to give up their free time to join protests. Workaholics are promoted. Managers are very self-important and condescending. As soon as staff resign (which happens very often), management make it clear they don't want them in the office and encourage them to take their notice period as leave. I didn't even know that was possible until I worked here. But then I had never worked for a cult before.\r\n\r\nWhen I got the job, I thought working at PETA would be a dream come true.

I would have stayed indefinitely if I didn\u2019t have my confidence shattered, my spirit broken and become completely burnt out. All these people who are passionate about making the world a better place for animals have that taken advantage of and end up belittled for their choice to prioritise their own lives.\r\n\r\n- There is so little trust in anyone - even people who have been there for years - to the point that inboxes are read, chats are monitored and each week a report of what you have done is sent to president to monitor staff. Not until I left did I realise quite how bizarre that is. Not a casual chat with your manager about work progress but a full blown written report of your completed and ongoing tasks that is passed up through varying stages of management and is often questioned if the output doesn\u2019t look good enough. \r\n\r\n- When I left, the entire office was white. Any members of staff who were not white had left after being tokenised or completely mistreated by upper management. Any staff concerns raised about this - or around any kind of intersectionality - were \u2018listened to\u2019 but completely dismissed.

I had never worked in a cult before. \r\n\r\n- Some of what goes on is truly shocking.\r\n\r\n- After observing what went on it didn't take long to realise that PETA actually wanted to test and break their staff mentally and psychologically.\r\n\r\n- The managers are not nice people. They are disrespectful, cold and downright rude. They literally ignore you for the vast majority of the time. The managers treat the staff \u2013 good, compassionate people \u2013 quite horribly. They will not speak to you or acknowledge you in the kitchen. They will literally blank you. One manager never said a single word to me on a personal level during my employment with PETA.\r\n\r\n- It doesn't matter how hard you do or don't work or whether you (try to) fit in and adapt to the PETA 'culture' - you will still be treated despicably whether you're 'cut out for it' or not. It's all the same regardless. Hard workers get treated awfully too.\r\n\r\n- Ignore the HR replies to the posts on here. It's not the fault of any HR staff though. They can do nothing so long as management want the situation to continue. So nothing changes. Management are not in the slightest interested in the well-being of their employees and making the PETA office in the least bit bearable, never mind actually nice, pleasant and welcoming. They do not care. Indeed this is the working environment they wish to cultivate because if not after years of such feedback then they would of addressed the very serious and alarming issues repeatedly raised. That ex-employees flag the same issues again and again repeatedly but nothing changes tells the story of what working at PETA is all about.\r\n\r\n- They exploit the idealism of young staff (who put up with a workplace environment and stay for longer than they otherwise would because of the difficulty of getting other employment in animal rights) who don\u2019t know much or any different and that the cultish conditions and atmosphere are not normal and very, very wrong. \r\n\r\n- They have a shameful and disgraceful policy of (continually) extending probations for trivial and spurious reasons to avoid giving staff a permanent contract and the security and piece of mind that gives when living and working in a very expensive city like London.\r\n\r\n- There is near total and absolute silence for most of the time. It was an utterly surreal and bizarre experience for adults to have to liaise professionally and communicate by whispering so often.\r\n\r\n- There is a genuine atmosphere of fear. People are literally afraid to talk. People get told off for talking to each other in the kitchen. I've never known anything like it.\r\n\r\n- PETA are incredibly harsh with people arriving late for whatever reason, with little to no concern that you may have had a stressful journey, or any consideration for and understanding of travelling and commuting in London and the delays that can occur which you are in no way responsible for. They can be rather selective with this though, as some staff get given more slack on this than others. Yet many staff work late each evening and give up their free time of an evening or of a weekend to attend demos and protests. That counts for absolutely nothing though if your tube line is down or has delays!\r\n\r\n- Staff re-locate from other countries, leave their previous jobs or turn down other jobs they have had offers for when they accept what they assume would be a dream job with PETA which soon turns into a nightmare experience. People can and do make huge changes to their lives to come and work for PETA and the animals, only to be treated appallingly for doing so. Hence why relatively few even see out a year at PETA.\r\n\r\n- Shocking and disgraceful treatment - rather than compassion and kindness - for those that have medical appointments and medical conditions.\r\n\r\n- Some promotions make absolutely no sense in terms of experience and suitability. It makes total sense with regard to favouritism though.\r\n\r\n- The staff turnover is unsurprisingly staggering and if only donors and supporters knew the cost and waste of the constant recruitment merry-go-round! You would always wonder who would be the next to leave. You would never have to wait very long at all though to find out. \r\n\r\n- Good, decent and talented people don't stay for very long who could achieved so much for PETA - and more importantly the animals - as there is a limit to how much people will put up with.\r\n\r\n- It's an even harder and more stressful experience if staff have few or any office friends or are not a part of any of the cliques.\r\n\r\n- Such a shame as it could of been so, so different.\r\n\r\n- Avoid at all costs."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Like Scientology but the pay is bad", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Administrator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- you work in an organisation where everybody shares some of your values\r\n- King's Cross office location\r\n- dogs in the office", "cons": "- there is no HR function to speak of, other than high turnover and endless recruitment\r\n- you're made to watch videos of animal cruelty as your induction but not to undertake any structured training\r\n- office is weirdly quiet\r\n- hostile atmosphere with cliques and aloof management who you never speak to\r\n- you are not trusted to work from home regardless of your role\r\n- management snoops into your life and brings your personal life into the office"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Avoid avoid avoid!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Campaigner in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Sometimes you get free food", "cons": "- Poor salary compared with other nonprofits in London\r\n- Awful management who are basically untrained and free to act as they wish due to lack of concrete HR dep.
