The outgoing CEO and Managing Director perpetuated a culture of toxicity, with several colleagues having to leave due to the treatment they experienced. Within the communications team, bullying and micro-management was rife, with relatively unskilled individuals being constantly promoted. Workload was also unbearably high, with little slack. Many team members lived in fear of the communications teams due to senior figures within it bullying, being disrespectful and sometimes even name-calling. \r\n\r\nStaff turnover is very high, they cycle through staff and then mock them when they 'can't handle how fast paced' the charity was. The charity is not fast paced, it is in fact one that pushes people to the limit and goes against it's feminist values in the way it treats and pays its majority-female staff. I was once told I was too positive, and needed to adopt more manly traits to succeed.\r\n\r\nNo qualified HR individual means that recurring cases of staff being bullied or burnt out by departments has gone unresolved. As a result, it wasn't uncommon to see multiple staff in the office in tears at any given time.\r\n\r\nOther reviews have mentioned nepotism, and I must agree. People who had been with the charity a long time were often promoted to roles they had no experience in, simply because they were in with senior management and meshed well with the false feminism and toxic positivity. Inevitably, this has meant that outside applicants from more diverse backgrounds have been unsuccessful with little justifiable reason."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great team", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Jul 2021", "job_title": "Communications Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A supportive and kind team full of passion and ambition.
