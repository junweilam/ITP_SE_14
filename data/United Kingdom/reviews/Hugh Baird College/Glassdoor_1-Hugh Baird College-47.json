I wasn't the only one staff are regularly told to carry on enrolling students till they are told to stop by management. Classic line \"we will employ more staff if needed\" this NEVER happened in my time.\r\n\r\n5) Management think it is acceptable to use the HR system as a stick to beat staff with, HR only listen to the side of the management when complaints are made and investigated. \r\n\r\n6) Staff are undervalued to the point of frustration you have a highly experienced and qualified workforce whose opinions don't count. Too many good and experienced staff leave because they are not valued.\r\n\r\n7) The college is in the habit of keeping \"dead wood\" and promoting them beyond what they are capable of.\r\n\r\n8) There is far to much paperwork to do, Lecturers are doing too many admin jobs because admin haven't got the personal to cope with it.\r\n\r\n9) Students are rushed through courses and given too much \"help\" with assessments so the college can keep its achievement figures up. \r\n\r\n10) Data is massaged regularly to suit, this is a directive from management to make the college look better than it is, staff feel pressured  to do this to avoid bad departmental reviews which normally would involve extra scrutiny and extra workload.\r\n\r\n11) New departments are set up with the focus of getting more students into the college, however due process is not always done and policies and procedures are not put in place early enough in order to safeguard staff and students. \r\n\r\n12) Management are unsupportive of personal issues staff may have and staff are made to feel guilty if they cannot fulfil their duties to the college fully. Management would rather good staff leave than support them through those issues giving them a safe and happy return to work.\r\n\r\n13) Workload and expectations are too great for all the reasons mentioned above you are expected to be and outstanding lecturer and deliver outstanding courses all the while dealing with the hidden responsibilities that are expected of you.
