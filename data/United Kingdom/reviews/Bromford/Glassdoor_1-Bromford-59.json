Best thing about Bromford is that I did make some good, solid friendships.", "cons": "I can see that Bromford still receives some pretty good reviews but I've noticed that these tend to be from new colleagues - it's pretty rare you'll see 5 stars from colleagues who've been in their role longer than around 3 years. This will likely be put down to longer serving colleagues 'resisting change' or suchlike. I can assure you that this is not the case for me. When I first joined Bromford I felt a real sense of pride at being part of such an amazing organisation - there was a brilliant culture, people genuinely cared about each other and about Bromford's overall purpose. I felt like I belonged to one big family with shared values and colleagues literally oozing the DNA it prides itself on. Social housing is, by its very nature, a challenging environment so it's absolutely essential that people work together as one team, collaborate, have each others' backs, receive clear direction and communication and always have the end goal in sight at all times. Sadly, this is not the case now. For the last 2 years of my employment, I found almost every single day draining and frustrating. Nobody knows who does what, there are lots of \"it's not my job\" and the poor neighbourhood coaches are constantly hung out to dry by senior management. As for the DNA - well, it seems that this is now just a pretty set of graphics to impress new starters. Many colleagues still live and breathe the DNA, some still have Bromford running through their veins, but I don't feel that this is modelled by the senior leadership team. Yes, change is absolutely necessary (and important) but the rate of change and knee jerking that goes on at Bromford is just ridiculous and unsustainable. Many of the execs have no social housing experience but that's apparently okay because that's what their directors/heads of are for. Which would be fine ... if only they actually empowered and listened to those people! Perhaps, instead of trying to aspire to be like Virgin, Amazon or some other corporate giant, the focus should be on actually getting the fundamentals right first. Customers are social housing tenants - they don't have a choice which housing association they go to, they get what they're given and all they want is a safe, warm, affordable, home. Of course, there's nothing wrong with aspiring to be the best but I think Bromord is a long way off - tasking neighbourhood coaches to run around their patches before Christmas, frantically fitting Co2 alarms into their customers' houses (because of another team's failings with compliance) does not feel like a Virgin or Amazon way to conduct business. Neither does the way the attempted cyber attack was handled. Yes, from an IT perspective it was dealt with excellently and could have been far worse - but, yet again, those on the front line were left to deal with the fallout of this, with no tools or guidance to help them navigate their way around the many difficult conversations they had to have with their customers. It's always the same - those on the lowest pay get the rawest deals. Those driving around in their Teslas would absolutely not want to have some of the difficult conversations with customers that the neighbourhood coaches are forced to have. Going out shadowing once a year and visiting one or two customers does not cut it. It took me some time to find the confidence and strength to start seriously looking for another job as, aside from everything else, I gradually became deskilled - my role was unrecognisable from the job I originally came to do and there was no consistency in the expectations of the job either. Initially, I protected myself from everything going on by concentrating on my own 'bubble' - I believed that as long as I just focused on my immediate team and ignored the bigger picture I'd manage. But even the bubble developed punctures in the end because, sadly, toxicity and negativity has a way of filtering through. I am just so grateful that fate stepped in with an amazing job opportunity and that I got out before any further damage could be done. So, my advice to anyone thinking of joining Bromford is do so at your own peril. It depends what kind of culture you want to work in, it will suit some people as everyone has different expectations. Of course, it might even turn itself around again one day in the same way it does when there's a new government. Who knows? I do hope so for the sake of those who've stayed loyal."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "So many great aspects yet fundamental flaws", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Neighbourhood Coach in Gloucester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The organisation has a great emphasis on wellbeing and has good intentions to get things right, yet it still seems to fail.", "cons": "Too many friends aligned at senior leadership, which is resulting in people not being accountable for their actions.

I loved the idea of the Bromford DNA, was completely sold by how I was told that employees were valued and I embraced the idea that I could really make a difference. Fast forward 14 months and I realised I had been brutally conned. I have never, ever worked for a company with such an unhappy workforce. Where people regularly leave work in tears and are being signed off with stress due to the incompetent management and pressures of the job. It is considered the norm.\nThe directors swan around in their brand new Tesla\u2019s whilst the staff are told payrise are frozen. I was actually told by my \u2018manager\u2019 that \u2018we work in social housing for the love of the job.\u2019 Interesting then that the directors enjoy a six figure salary and fat cat bonuses so that ethos does not carry through to the top. Oh, but it\u2019s ok, because when they do cancel your payrise\u2026\u2026they send you a KITKAT! For a company that proclaims it values it\u2019s carbon footprint\u2026.they posted 2000 individual boxes which contained one KITKAT to its staff. What a degrading, condescending, marketing failure. Here is a novel idea Bromford - pay your staff what they are actually worth and forget the cheap marketing gimmicks which hugely backfired.\nAnother novel concept from Bromford; manipulate the pandemic and employ intelligent and passionate individuals on a really low salary. Because you can. Then, when the pandemic eases and people start to leave (to companies who actually value them), employ some more\u2026.but pay the new staff 25% more than the current ones. Oh, and to add insult to injury, ask the existing staff to train the new staff even though they are paid more! Don\u2019t even think about raising it in a meeting though - our manager frequently rolled her eyeballs and even said she was \u2018bored\u2019 with the complaints about salary.\nStress levels within Bromford are ridiculously high - I have worked in many companies and it is immediately apparent how unhappy everyone is. Not just in income but also Lettings, repairs, contact centre, neighbourhood coach\u2019s etc\u2026.the list is endless. Apparently the turnover is \u2018within expected parameters\u2019 though so that\u2019s absolutely fine then!\nBromford enjoy paying expensive consultants lots of money (they clearly don\u2019t do it for the love of the job unlike the Bromford minions), to produce very pretty charts. These pretty charts are produced at least twice a year and the pretty charts are discussed with the Tesla driving directors. They should show how happy everyone is at work and whether it\u2019s a \u2018great place to work.\u2019 Very often the charts aren\u2019t pretty enough for the directors and don\u2019t show the data they would like them to show. And so, they send out yet more carefully scripted surveys to staff (who have so much time to play colour by numbers ) and the expensively paid consultants have another go.\nFinally, the DNA. Do not be fooled - it is merely a marketing ploy to make you believe they care. They do not. Phrases such as \u2018we benchmark salaries\u2019, \u2018we appreciate your feedback and will take that back\u2019, \u2018mental well-being is important\u2019 are regularly regurgitated yet are meaningless and soulless. They do NOT want you to embrace the DNA at all. They DO want you to Be Suppressed,  Be Stressed, Be Compliant, Be Happy with Being Underpaid, Undervalued and Treated Like a Replaceable Non Entity by Management with Over Inflated Egos. But - it\u2019s ok - because the particularly bad management won awards on their management skills!\nValue your mental health? Turn, very quickly, and run, very quickly, far far away from Bromford.
