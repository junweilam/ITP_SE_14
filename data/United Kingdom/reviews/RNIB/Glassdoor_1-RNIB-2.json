However, they treat their regular staff, upon whom the company could not function without, appallingly!  Like many UK companies today there is a 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' mentality. Pay below the level of Band M3 is dire, whilst those from Director level up are handsomely paid in comparison.  To add to the ridiculousness of it there is a 'developing' and 'competent' level within each Band.  The way that appraisals are run means that even Jesus Christ would not gain 'outstanding' and please note that the aim is to ensure that 'outstanding' is never attained! That would mean an increase in performance related pay.  In contrast the Directors are doing each others appraisals. That's more money in their pockets! I came into this organisation in the belief that I might be able to retire from the RNIB when the time came.  However, 'restructuring' the buzz word of the moment, has seen a number of people close to retirement being made redundant, at at time in their lives when the chances of future employment are close to nil.  Thanks to the 'Olympic Legacy' there is a move towards volunteering.  What this means is that paid workers are slowly being replaced by volunteers regionally. The irony here is that many of these volunteers are seeking full-time paid work within the organisation. Many sections are headed by Interims, who are not only earning vast sums in comparison to everyday staff, but their agencies are also earning vast sums.  These interims are making decisions about the RNIB that they will not be there to 'suffer' from.  Finally, there are not enough visually impaired or ethnic staff at the higher levels, especially at Director level, which is a travesty."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Charity has gone through some hard times but has transformed with a refreshed brand and a clear mission", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "19 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Innovation and Technology Manager in Peterborough, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Staff passion for the cause.\r\nNew senior management team with energy and focus.", "cons": "Some staff still shell-shocked from a number of turbulent years. \r\nReduction of benefits (much poorer Pension scheme, poor prospects of salary increases)"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "A charity that has lost its way", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people in my team and overall friendly atmosphere", "cons": "Management appear to be out of touch with the mission statement of the charity.
