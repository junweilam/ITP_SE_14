Before I go into my own experiences I've had friends who have been let go from casual bar roles for not giving enough availability (you hire casual staff, you get casual staff) and generally ignored, dehumanized or treated with general indifference. I think the NT feel like they can treat their staff how they like because people will line up to work for them given their reputation and their high pay.\r\n\r\nMy experience of working in the Box Office was a decent enough one at first - the job requires you to take in a lot of  changing information but this is honestly reflected in the pay so I have no problem with this.\r\n\r\nWhat ruined the job for me was management, and multiple layers of it. Some supervisors were lovely and assisted with any inquires graciously while others seemed to be overly guarded and seemed to feel that assisting was somewhat beneath them. The real problems came when I wanted to discuss changing my contract from Part Time to Casual:\r\n\r\nPart of the process involves handing notice for your current contract which I decided to do six weeks in advance. I had been discussing things with the operations manager when he got massively sick and was still absent once the date had passed. Eventually I asked him what was going on after the date had passed and I had effectively left the company. The email I got back was rude and dismissive and tried to blame me for the fact that he was unaware of the date I had left on my notice. I responded with proof that I had given a date and that his claim that I had asked to change my date was false and since then I have not had a single word from anyone in the box office.\r\n\r\nSince that email the following has occurred:\r\n\r\n-I have continued to be paid since leaving because the same operations manager had failed to send over the leaver form necessary to take me off payroll.\r\n-Upon finding out that he neglected his responsibilities I made a formal complaint to the Box Office management about both continuing to be paid and the treatment mentioned above.\r\n-I received a call from the HR department that only provided a weak apology despite my extensive grievances. They were far more focused on me paying the money back then addressing how I had been treated over the months.\r\n-I emailed back stating that the time-frame for me to pay was unreasonable given the inconvenience imposed upon me. I asked for my complaints to be addressed by anyone at all. It's been a week and I've heard nothing.\r\n\r\nIf you work for the NT you can expect to be royally dismissed, generally condescended to and have management that disregard your concerns and send the message that they are totally above acknowledging doing any wrongdoing. The organizational skills are a shambles.
