Staff feel that they cannot raise issues with HR due to personal relationships between members of the leadership team and fear of retribution from perpetrators. \n\nThere is one member of staff in particular who\u2019s behaviour has been a contributing factor to several long-standing members of staff leaving. This person regularly bullies, belittles, and humiliates people, when this has been brought to the attention of HR or leadership, no action has been taken. In another department, there are two men who treat women in a very misogynistic way. Complaints have been made about both; no action has been taken. HR take the position that if the victim does not lodge a formal grievance, they will take no action. This is unacceptable. \n\nBoundless state that they are a not-for-profit mutual, Boundless itself is run as a private limited company, which employs all head office staff. There is a separate board for the club, CSMA, which is not for profit. One of the core values of the club is 'Member First', sadly, this is rarely the case. Many projects that are in the members' interest are shut down due to internal politics. \n\nDiversity and inclusion is a problem at Boundless. There majority of employees are white, and the environment (colleagues and customers) is often hostile for black & ethnic minority colleagues. Most of the senior leadership team are white men over the age of 40, however, there has recently been a woman appointed as CFO and one woman in a \u2018head of\u2019 role. The leadership team were encouraged to self-nominate someone to champion diversity & inclusion at Boundless, nobody came forward. \n\nBoundless offer below market rate salaries, they benchmark their roles based on public sector salaries, although they are not a public sector or charitable organisation. There is no pay band structure. The gender pay gap is significant, this was attributed to women being more likely to apply for admin and hospitality roles - it would be prudent to question why that is.
