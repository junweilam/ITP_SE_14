The charity says it's trying to fix its history of racism & needs everyone on board to do that, but at the same time the majority white senior leadership team aren't willing to renumerate POC staff for their time and expertise. Senior leadership team are also willing to shoot the messenger when people threaten the status quo. But the status quo needs to change for the charity to have a chance at surviving the next few years. People who have spoken out have been made redundant or had probation periods extended for very flimsy reasons. Staff have the choice of carrying on as if the current situation is OK (it isn't) or speaking up about problems and suggesting improvements but risking their jobs in the process."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "White, gay male dominated play ground", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2020", "job_title": "LGBT Independent Domestic Violence Advocate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you\u2019re liked by the boys - you\u2019re in the club!", "cons": "Unprofessional, cliquey, demotivating, traumatizing, uncomfortable and very white"}]]
