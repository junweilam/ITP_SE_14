In the last month or so I've personally worked on:\r\n- An open letter that's had a really positive response from an independent pay review body\r\n- Fundraising for, designing, and booking in a full page ad in a national paper in the space of week\r\n- Designing and implementing a spiky tactic that saw 1000 NHS staff send in \u00a33.50 to Boris Johnson showing him exactly what his proposed pay review would look like - also planned and launched in just a few days\r\n- Supporting a nurse who's been struggling during the pandemic to come to London and take her message straight to Downing Street - culminating in her being interviewed line on breakfast tv\r\n- Producing an online leader board to showcase where MPs stand on an issue - to better hold them to account\r\n- Supporting 38 Degrees members to promote and champion getting the vaccine with their friends and family, an action that could literally save lives\r\n\r\nThis barely scratches the surface on the kinds of things I've worked on at 38 Degrees over the last 8 years, but shows that even in the last month where we've been focused on finishing our new strategy, and are low on capacity, there's huge scope for pushing the boat out and stretching yourself. As an organisation we want people to think first and foremost about what will have the achieved impact - and then worry about what is and isn't possible afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs with any organisation we do have other internal metrics that can speak to organisation health around things like fundraising, and engagement from membership, but those are constantly reviewed depending on what's happening both internally and externally.\r\n\r\n38 Degrees has also, the entire time I've been there, offered a lot of support to employees. I think this is particularly evident in the support offered over the last year during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe last year has been a pretty difficult one for a lot of people, but 38 Degrees has offered a lot of support to try and make it easier during that time. I wanted to list out just a few of the things I've benefited from, or witnessed others benefitting from, in the last year:\r\n\r\n9 Day Fortnight - and subsequent pay increase on the back of it:\r\nWhen it became evident how long the pandemic would last, and how much of a toll it was having on people, the organisation introduced a 9 day fortnight to give us more time to recuperate - this obviously meant people were working fewer hours, but salary did not change on the back off it leading to what was essentially a ten percent pay rise for all staff\r\nExtension of temporary contracts - pre pandemic we had four new interns start on what was only ever confirmed as an 8 month contract. However when it became apparent that their contracts would run out midway through the first lockdown the organisation extended them by an extra three months to give those interns more time to find new employment\r\nFlexible approach to childcare requirements - obviously things like school closures puts added strain on staff with children, and the organisation was really flexible in accommodating that\r\nPersonalised approach to the specific challenges faced by the pandemic. I witnessed one instance where a junior member of staff was in a particularly difficult situation outside of work, and asked for help. The organisation went above and beyond, including with financial aid, to help support them in getting out of that situation. I have no doubt that that same level of support would be offered to others in a similar place - and perhaps has been in circumstances I'm not aware of.\r\nSocial hours - we'd always been a pretty close knit team, and for some not working in an office together really took its toll on staff happiness, so the organisation has introduced social hours every couple of weeks where, over zoom, we can come together and take part in activities separate to work - often able to expense materials, lunch and more as part of it\r\nMental health initiatives - the organisation has purchased headspace memberships for everyone in the team, offered training for mental health awareness courses, and paid for a number of team members to be trained up as mental health first aiders\r\n\r\nWe also have a really generous learning and development budget, with time set aside to allow members of staff to go on training and courses during the work day, and whilst there is a set individual budget, on a case by case basis the organisation will allow people to spend over that if a particular course or bit of training costs more.\r\n\r\nThe final element of 38 Degrees support that I would like to flag is around pay. Pay at 38 Degrees is a lot higher than other organisations in the sector - as is evidenced by the fact that our internship pays more pro rata than than a lot of campaigns assistant and campaigner roles out there. Additionally I have received a pay rise every single year that I've been at 38 Degrees, regardless of whether or not my role title or responsibilities have changed. When I talk about this with friends working at other organisations or in different sectors they've always been surprised at this as a lot have gone years without a salary increase as that has been fully dependent on things like a role change.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to see other recent reviews talk about how our income hasn't changed at all, when we have weekly updates on income and so everyone should know that over the last six months we have seen a pretty big decrease in our monthly income. But thankfully as an organisation we've always had a goal of maintaining good reserves to get through dips in income, and I feel confident that when we finalise our new strategy and can implement plans we can see that start to go up again! And despite that, whilst pay rise percentages have dropped a bit over the last 12 months, to my knowledge every single member of staff has had an above inflation increase at their annual review.\r\n\r\nOn diversity, equity and inclusion as with basically every workplace out there 38 Degrees is not perfect. There will always be room for improvement, there will always be times when things go wrong, but I know the SLT and SMT want to work with the team to improve.\r\n\r\nFor me personally I'm a queer woman who has never felt able to be anything but open about that at work. I have a disability that means things like office equipment for me is going to be more expensive, but work has always been sure to buy whatever I need to work well - both in our London office, and when we moved to home working. On multiple occasions they've paid for professional assessments so I and they know I have exactly what I need. I have fairly severe long term depression and SLT and my line manager have never been anything buy supportive in giving me time off when needed, and pointing me to the support they personally pay for to provide, like an Employee Assistance Program. \r\n\r\nI know that, especially considering some of the other recent reviews, a lot of this may sound a bit too good to be true, or an embellishment, but I don't really believe in saying anything anonymously. And I'm also really excited at the prospect of some wonderful new colleagues joining in our current recruitment process and would love to talk more about this organisation I'm proud to be a part of. So if you have any questions about this review, the other reviews mentioned, or the various roles currently open - my name is Megan Bentall and you are more than welcome to message me on LinkedIn to ask them!", "cons": "We've been a bit delayed in writing our new strategy together as an organisation. First due to the previous CEO leaving, then Covid slowing things down too. The delays have meant that we haven't been able to have as much impact in the last year as we have previously, and has led to some frustrations amongst the staff team that have been difficult at times. That being said we are less than a month away from the strategy being finalised and I am really really excited to start putting things in action and see where we get to next.\r\n\r\nUnder the former CEO we had some pretty lose policies on things like promotion, pay and HR procedures. It was ok when we were a smaller organisation - though still open to abuse - but as we grow it's been necessary to actually put fair processes into place. They were policies that would particularly benefit people who's voices are loudest, or were best at championing themselves, and a real shift has been made by the organisation to change that. Obviously if you're someone who would particularly benefit from that unfair system these changes won't be popular with you, and so this has seen some staff leave as a result. And there are still new policies that need to be worked out by the team and by the union. This process has been slow going at times, and been quite difficult emotionally, but I'm glad we're doing the work to make things fairer, and look forward to completing it.\r\n\r\nWork/Life balance. We're a team of people that are really really passionate about the issues we campaign on the members we represent. That's good, but it does also mean we are always pushing to do more, and react to everything that's going on, and if we all want to make change happen we're not always that great at reigning each other in. It can sometimes mean long hours, and working at a fast pace, and getting carried away with doing as much as possible - which can be pretty exhausting. That being said we encourage people to take TOIL for over time worked, and any overworking is never something I'm pressured into doing by anyone other than myself and my need to do all the things.\r\n\r\nNo workplace is perfect, and there are definitely challenges at 38 Degrees, but there's a reason I've been here 8 years - and look forward to the next 8!"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Deliberately getting rid of everything that once made it a great place to work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "9 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Software Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Amazing colleagues.

Staff turnover is extremely high - around half of the entire campaigns team has progressively left in the past 12 months. New starters routinely leave before their probation period ends.

Leadership at 38D (which *absolutely* includes the board and board chair) have repeatedly failed to listen to staff who have raised concerns \u2014 staff are trying to escalate their concerns, leadership refuse to engage or deny what they\u2019re raising, and the staff members eventually have no choice but to eventually resign in frustration. \r\n\r\nEvery organisation is institutionally racist, but 38 Degrees\u2019 lack of investment in both anti-racism campaigning and policies says it all about how deeply entrenched the systems of oppression are at this workplace. When racism has been called out, both privately and in all-team sessions, it has been met by denial, and a refusal to engage with or rectify the issues.\r\n\r\nAs an organisation, 38 Degrees are failing to do the hard work when it comes to dealing with oppression. In fact, what we're doing is one step worse - we're making the public statements when there's external pressure (i.e. George Floyd), and then failing to follow through with anything substantive.
