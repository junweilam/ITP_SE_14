We're aiming to modernise to the extent that by the end of 2021, our customers get a much better service AND colleagues can focus on doing more skilled and important work  (e.g. no more hand printing and delivering thousands of letters to customers). It's a genuinely exciting time to work here, and there's a real sense that every individual can make a difference.\r\n\r\nDespite not being in a customer-facing role, I feel like what I'm doing makes a difference - coming from the technology sector, Silva Homes is like a breath of fresh air.  Our personal hours/demands are respected and flexi-time and home-working are popular options.", "cons": "Situated in quite an industrial area - there are a few caf\u00e9s nearby and a great greasy spoons, but not much else.
