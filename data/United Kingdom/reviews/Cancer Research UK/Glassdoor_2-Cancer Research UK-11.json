While some of these experiences were positive, my overall experience with the organisation was mixed. To begin with the positives, I met some lovely people during my time at Cancer Research UK, some of whom have become friends for life. As a shop volunteer, intern and fundraiser, I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of people who were passionate about supporting the charity's mission. However, my experience as a full-time employee in head office roles was quite different. I ultimately left after an experience where I felt I was bullied by my line manager, and felt I had no choice but to leave.", "cons": "The corporate environment at Cancer Research UK was difficult to navigate, and the hierarchy was very pronounced. Senior staff members were often inaccessible, making it challenging to get things done efficiently. As a junior employee, I found it challenging to get any face-to-face time with these individuals, let alone have an informal chat. It felt like there was a clear hierarchy in place, and if you were below a certain level, you were simply not important enough to warrant their attention. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, some of the processes in place were outdated and inefficient, which made it difficult to work effectively. One of the most significant challenges I faced during my time at Cancer Research UK was in my final role, where I felt I was bullied by a manager. I was excited to make an internal move into a more creative role. Unfortunately, I found that weeks into this position, the new manager's approach quickly escalated beyond normal performance expectations and became both strange and extreme.\r\n\r\nDespite my very junior level and best efforts to perform well, I felt their focus on my mistakes was entirely disproportionate, and that she was actively looking for ways to set me up for failure. Additionally, she declined any requests to work from home and cast suspicion on the \u2018true nature\u2019 of my absence when I developed flu in the winter.\r\n\r\nThis constant scrutiny and criticism began to have a significant impact on my confidence, job satisfaction and mental health. I found myself constantly doubting my abilities and questioning my every move.\r\n\r\nWhen I reported the bullying to HR, I was informed that my complaint was unlikely to be successful because I could not prove malicious intent. Years later, I realised this is not how employment law works, but I was very junior at the time. The charity offered me the option to abandon my grievance and leave with a month\u2019s pay, which I felt I had no choice but to accept. \r\n\r\nThis situation caused a great deal of stress and emotional turmoil, and it took me a year to fully recover my confidence. The individual continued to work at the charity and progressed to a more senior level, so I would never consider returning.\r\n\r\nOverall, my experience with Cancer Research UK was mixed. While I met some wonderful people and had some positive experiences, the corporate environment was challenging for a junior employee. I was let down by HR's response to my bullying complaint, despite the charity's messaging about the importance of addressing bullying in the workplace (ironically)."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Policy advisor", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "8 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Policy Advisor in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting and wide ranging policy areas,", "cons": "Constant reorganisation and change within organisation"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Job review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Project Manager in Stratford, London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work from home flexibility Meaningful work", "cons": "Alot of work for the pay Lots of restructure, sense of direction is a bit lost Not always clear why we do certain things Lack of diversity Quite competitive environment Meant to be flexible working but really just a cover for working all hours"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great cause", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "23 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Relationship Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Passionate employees, great team work for a good cause", "cons": "long hours and weekend work sometimes required"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Very Good Atmosphere", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Software Engineer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Excellent Tech Stack - Friday L&D Time - No pressure - Excellent Engineers", "cons": "- Salary is low as compared to the market"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Fun", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Volunteer in Ealing, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly staff, fun environment and lovely customers.", "cons": "Nothing much, I really enjoyed it."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "It\u2019s ok", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Innovation Specialist in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working Freedom Great central location", "cons": "Lots of people just there for The charity tickbox, not for cause"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great first job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Graduate Scheme in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Varied experience working with different teams", "cons": "Low pay, especially for London"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great people, ok career progression, stagnant salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "9 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Programme Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people, good place to work, interesting projects.
