The most hard to reach young people are sometimes forgotten, as there is too much focus on getting \"success stories\" out there, there is less acknowledgement of what the average young person experiences. HR are very disorganized, I have known staff that were awarded a higher grade after an interview process, then they were told that they would not get to act in the higher grade because of a pay freeze. Too much focus on getting famous people to be seen to support the trust, than actually spending time with young people, very few of the staff actually have any direct contact with young people, whilst outsourcing is a fantastic way to diversify skills and programmes offered, it means that the organisation loses sight of their client group. When attending a meeting for all staff in the area, the question was asked \"who is our client?\" Everyone from fundraisers to patrons to schools were mentioned, but young people were not mentioned once.
