I love to teach and to add value to student experience, despite being undervalued, in reality, except in terms of some complimentary words that ultimately meant little and seem now to have been offered only to extract more work and value from me for so little remuneration - at least that is now the strong perception, as I piece my history teaching here at Newcastle together: the sad fragments that are now left. This is also the case with others, too, however, as many postgraduate researchers find themselves in such a situation where their labour is barely remunerated and thus objectively hardly valued. Lecturers, too, have often confided such to me as well, both in terms of the good and also in terms of the bad. The reason I mention some bad here is because even the pros have sucked me in to gain more value from me - work gone spectacularly unremunerated by me here at Newcastle. So, to be truthful in the truest way, the pros even have been used as cons. In this institutional context, alas. Hence why I mention them here, too, then!", "cons": "Academia - and at Newcastle, this is so, too - is becoming more and more like a sausage factory - process the work quickly and efficiently, no matter how deeply and excellently one manages to feed back. Into the bargain, one will not be valued in a truly fair and rewarding financial way. I put so many hours including vast amounts of effort into my work and for what? No commendation at the end of it, some fine words on the way while I was needed and in relation to the past, yet once my term came to an end, what? Very little indeed and some might say a big fat nothing - with no final words of thanks (for my work is probably more or less all done). Work-life balance is hard when you are expected to do a really good or even a brilliant job within very strict deadlines. One can end up almost killing oneself, what with the other commitments of a busy researcher, too. Pay has also not gone up for postgraduate workers for a number of years (or, if it has, by hardly anything and from a low base). This is also the case for full lecturers and other staff, too, while senior management award themselves very high pay rises. This I consider outrageous. Who adds value by teaching the students, by marking, by even giving lectures? And for what? I had been proud to work for Newcastle University and saw myself as doing a grand job, until, that is, I felt undervalued and realised that I had put in all too much and got so little back in return. Vulnerable staff who are deeply committed will be used and the maximum of exploitation will be extracted from them/us. And it is systemic, with PGRs paid at a very low rate especially in terms of those who have prior lecturing experience (but this is not an argument for a tired pay structure, but for more rigorous training!). \r\n\r\nAcademia deserves to be better than this. And I for one am very disappointed. UCU needs to look into these questions far more systematically, too, and try to help PGRs and other workers in vulnerable positions to improve their pay and their levels of support to each other - a culture of co-operation needs to be developed - by UCU as well as by the University. Why is this not happening? Does one wonder why UCU membership seems to be declining and dissatisfaction with the university increasing in the mood music behind closed doors of staff - of the best and most committed staff often? If no or little action is taken and no consistent and principled fight launched to rectify this situation, why would people wish to remain in such unions or indeed in Newcastle University? I am of course a member of UCU as well as ideally proud to be associated with teaching and training at Newcastle University. On the basis of high principle and fairness, I have engaged in strike action, for example, but the organisation of UCU, albeit it (its members) of course has good intentions, needs to be more than a mere talking shop with little bite behind it. Leadership within UCU, nationally and in local branches, then, is crucial, but more or as importantly as that, much leadership is required from Newcastle University as an organisation to make its workplace a good and a happy one, full of the joys of teaching, learning and development of all for all: not a top-down culture, but an inclusive and co-operative one that evens out and smooths out all invidious remuneration differentials is needed. For that, the Vice-Chancellor and senior management should keep their own pay right down (yes, endure some real cuts and share the distribution of a healthy pie more fully and widely) and not turn universities into cut and thrust big businesses and in doing so, deprave and dissipate our intellectual and academic culture in a de facto philistine direction. Sharing and co-operation are essential to this new culture I am urging upon management, which will re-incentivise the vast majority of staff, if implemented substantially. \r\n\r\nWe need to change and accentuate co-operation before so much of the richesse disappears down the vast bottomless pits of pay packets for the top ten percent or so, as compared with feeble, virtually non-existent rises for the vast majority of workers at Newcastle University and this means on all levels, not just for academic or part-time academic staff (cleaners and their conditions of work are a real case in point: how an organisation treats the most vulnerable of workers in its midst tells one much about an organisation and there are all kinds of inequities and unfairnesses that cleaners have raised with me before, such as: when someone is off sick, the cleaners who nonetheless still come to work must take up the slack of the workers who are absent, with no extra remuneration or pay for overtime or the like; this is poor practice indeed and it should be stopped and another system adopted; perhaps others could be asked to come in and offered the work instead - for favourable rates of pay, or the staff who do come in that day might be offered higher remuneration and compensation for that extra work needing to be undertaken, yet it is a problem that happens again and again at Newcastle University and cleaners often complain justly of this unfair extra burden). \r\n\r\nAnother kind of education is possible, for otherwise, all the best people in academia (as well as good support workers) will be driven away and all that will be left is the careerist types, senior management or higher bureaucrats and the likely self-interested chancers who tend to dominate the top positions. Believe you me, I have discussed this unhappiness with a good number of fine academics here, too, and they absolutely agree with me. A fair portion of those are being driven away, little by little, yet seemingly ineluctably so! And many others are getting increasingly restless and disgruntled.
