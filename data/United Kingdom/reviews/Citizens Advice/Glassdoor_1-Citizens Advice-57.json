Lack of recognition. \r\nLack of recognition - no interest in providing recognition to congratulate staff on handling tricky calls (including suicidal clients). \r\n\r\nToilet breaks - Ah toilet breaks.. it goes without saying that in any other contact centre role, you will be allocated specific time for toilet breaks which do not encroach on your personal rest time off the phones. Unfortunately, cannot say the same for CA - have to take time out of your breaks to nip to the loo, so unless you have an extremely strong bladder, this may not be the role for you.\r\n\r\nGeneral role is monotonous - dealing with the same enquiries every day, little to no variation in methods of working (eg. webchat one day, phones on the next). \r\nClients can also be very rude (not CA fault but something to keep in mind). \r\n\r\nNo social aspects to the role - socials at CA used to be ok (and that is being generous) however since the pandemic there has been no focus on team building exercises and the company feels very split, managers are not interested in building relationship with their teams.\r\n\r\nSick pay not included in package. \r\n\r\nManagement can be hard to approach due to lack of rapport/relationship between managers/team leaders and call handlers.\r\n\r\nSystems used are useless/temperamental - do not be surprised if you have to manually input data into the system after a phone call with a client as Flare (system used by consumer team) is constantly failing - can lead to a more stressful day - Management seem to have no interest in improving the systems they use, despite feedback from call handlers. \r\n\r\nFinally, and probably the most detrimental aspect to the organisation, is the lack of diversity within the team - working in the Caerphilly office illustrated this - I cannot think of one non-white person that has been employed whilst I worked there - shocking, really.\r\n\r\nIf the above does not hinder your view on this organisation then the role will be perfect for you.

I had to get up at 7am to catch buses and train to get 20 miles away for training. \r\nI'm qualified in law and I always thought that knowing your legal rights are a basic human right and shouldn't be only for those who can afford it, so that was my motivation for volunteering. I felt as if I could be helpful to others.\r\nThere was one teacher on her own in training centre. One class was about how even in domestic abuse cases, if the police ask questions about the victim then we can't say anything. I don't think she had any real legal training, because I remembered that the law had changed so that even if a victim drops an abuse case under pressure, the police can carry on with the prosecution, so for no other reason than wanting to learn and find out their procedures I asked what we do if we feel a victim's life is in danger, which I thought was a good question, and she said we still can't give any information about the victim. I told her that I understood and accepted that, thinking that was the end of the matter. \r\nThen at the end of the class she said she was concerned that I wouldn't be discreet, going into detail about how her sister had been in an abusive relationship. I said I was just trying to learn about what we're supposed to do, and thought she understood me explaining a second time about why I asked, wondering why she needed to give personal details about her sister away. She didn't seem very professional with discretion. Other times she would go into details about her other sister use has asperger's syndrome, to a classroom of people she didn't know, so if anybody wasn't discreet it was her. \r\nIt wasn't until I had a few weeks of training that they told me I had to phone up myself to find an office to volunteer in. I phoned up an office who didn't seem to want anybody new but said to go in. First day I got there it seemed as if they didn't want me there. I wasn't shown around or told what to do. No clients came in and I just had to sit there being bored, Then 5 mins before office closed they said I could sit in with an advisor who had just finished training herself. She was a bit odd as didn't seem interested in helping me with my first day or helping me to feel at ease when I was asking questions about what to do. I told adviser I was nervous as hadn't sat in with a client before thinking she would help me, but she just ignored me, so I went into the room with her and the client was talking to her but also kept looking at me so I didn't want to be rude and smiled and nodded at her. Then after we walked out of the room I said to the adviser that I had been nervous sitting in for the first time ever, but instead of helping me she started stomping around and went to the manager to say I had talked to the client, when I just didn't want to appear rude when she was looking at me.\r\nIt was an awful experience and I wasted my time for nothing.
