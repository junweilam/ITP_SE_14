A recent reviewer has voiced the need for \"more respect\", but if employers aren't giving their employees respect, then how can they expect the same in return? No one owes any employer respect if they had a bad experience at said workplace; that's not how reviews work. Seeing as said review was written by a manager (or, as I heavily suspect, a member of the senior exec team masquerading as a manager as some sort of PR exercise in response to a recent negative review), it speaks volumes of the entirely different levels of respect experienced by members of management vs. non management. I think it's incredibly ignorant for said reviewer to blanket-accuse negative reviews as somehow being falsehoods and setting out to tarnish the reputation of the IOP. I don't dispute that people enjoy/have enjoyed working at the IOP but this certainly wasn't my experience of the place (or that of a vast number of reviewers on here).\r\n\r\nI respect the IOP's mission to make physics more accessible and, as a previous reviewer has stated, dedication to changing the physics landscape, but what I don't respect is the organisation's attitude towards its \"lower echelon\" staff. Intriguingly, reading the past two positive reviews, the bombastic oratory (almost Churchillian in its devotion) of the one dated 6th October could only have originated from the upper echelons, while the one dated 5th October looks as though it was copied and pasted straight from the IOP's organisational values toolkit. Whether you believe either to be authentic is a matter of personal opinion...\r\n\r\nIn my role at the IOP, I felt like a mere cog in a machine and not a respected member of staff. My manager had little time for me and didn't assign me a workload that was a) set out in the job description b) challenged me to use my skillset in any shape or form. In fact, I felt surplus to staffing requirements as there was such little work to do. The more interesting and substantial projects were outsourced to external consultants, which made me wonder why they bothered hiring me at all. This signals to me very out of touch senior exec and management teams who aren't attuned to their own organisational priorities, let alone the needs of their staff. Massively demotivating, as you can imagine. You can hark on about staff survey results all you want but I know anecdotally that many people were unhappy during their time at the IOP.\r\n\r\nThe IOP's lack of direction and gumption to see through plans and strategies seems to be a recurring theme that's dragged on for several years. It\u2019s a shame that this long-running issue still hasn\u2019t been tackled, and one would hope that the upper echelons will address this problem going forward.\r\n\r\nAnother reviewer mentions a resounding feeling of dissatisfaction/not feeling valued or respected among non-senior staff, and I can confirm that this is very true. Various colleagues confided in me that they were unhappy about the toxic atmosphere and unyielding attitude of the senior exec team in particular. In short, certain departments at IOP (but perhaps not all of them) aren't the place to flex your creative muscles, gain recognition and grow professionally. As per a recent review, I too was very aware of issues with bullying and management not reacting too kindly when challenged on certain issues."}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Education", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Coach in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good benefits and encouraged to work independently.

What is more worrying is that managers who under perform are never identified and offered a chance to improve, resulting in a negative atmosphere developing as their teams feel neglected.\r\n\r\nThere is a distinct lack of community between the executive staff and the rest of the workforce too; an \u201cus vs them\u201d attitude means that many staff do not feel their work is valued or their input is important or even recognised by the senior management.\r\n\r\nAnother review summed it up nicely: the words \u201cthank you\u201d do not seem to be in the vocabulary of those that reap the reputational rewards that stem from the hard work of others. \r\n\r\nExecutive staff are unable to resist micromanaging, usually resulting in detrimental outcomes as they lack specialized knowledge and relevant experience, something they are obviously unwilling to admit. Undue pressure is placed on departmental heads and below with junior staff having to bear the grunt of this, slowing down progress and stifling advancement. \r\n\r\nMoney is heamorrhaged at a rate that would imply some staff are unaware of the organisation\u2019s charitable status, meaning when things go wrong and even more expenditure is needed to correct faults, no-one is held accountable. \r\n\r\nResistance to transparency by senior staff means at best, others feel they are frustratingly left in the dark and then caught out when changes are implemented, and at worst, means staff feel ignored, devalued, and lied to.\r\n\r\n An example of this was when staff satisfaction survey results were manipulated and presented by the executive management, meant that a whole workforce had their own opinions twisted and presented back to them as lies. \r\n\r\nThis is just one, if not particularly damning example, of how little executive staff respect the thoughts and opinions of their workforce and are unwilling to address the issues that are there. \r\n\r\nAll of these issues are amplified by the accelerated and supposed \u201cdevelopment\u201d of the IOP \u2013 a company that perhaps was not ready to take on so much change so quickly. These failures drive a vicious cycle that adds to the negative climate: staff are unhappy, staff then voice their views, nothing is done and so staff leave.\r\n\r\nWith high staff turnover comes delays in these long term projects and adds even more anxiety and pressure to those that have remained, until they too decide it is better to leave. \r\n\r\nMy advice? Until significant changes and improvements are made, avoid working there altogether."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "A company who cares", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Project Coordinator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people\r\nChance to be creative and work on challenging projects\r\nFamily atmosphere\r\nEverybody helps each other, at all levels\r\nGreat work/life balance\r\nSupportive of personal and professional progress", "cons": "None really.
