Officially there is a clear directive on academic teaching / contact hours..... but a lot of contact hours fall below the radar - particulalry in areas of assessment and tutorial support. Successful allocation of workloads sadly depends on whether you happen to have a good line manager, or whether you have a line manager who just doesn't understand the sizeable element of academic workload that lies beneath the surface of their spreadsheets. For instance in heavily increased administrative work processes, that used to be carried out by admin colleagues, but following \"efficiency drives\" (cutting back on admin staff) this work has been delegated to software processes, that need to be managed by academic staff in addition to their academic duties. There has also been a dizzying increase in bureaucracy in the overall HE sector, and this is very much apparent within this HE institution."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Trainee program", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Junior Animator in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "university offered a job on a project in my desired industry", "cons": "the pay was very low"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Work with some great colleagues", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Senior Lecturer In Management in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice people, lovely location, very student focussed", "cons": "Its a teaching university with little room for research"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "The Most Clique Company I Have Worked For", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Coordinator in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The students\r\nInitiating change from the university", "cons": "No wellbeing to employees\r\nClear favourites who can do no wrong and get promoted above their abilities"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Kicthen", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Feb 2022", "job_title": "BOH Kitchen Staff in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good peaople . . .", "cons": "bad food . . . ."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "workplace", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Feb 2022", "job_title": "PhD Researcher in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good work and life balance,", "cons": "Have to improve facilities in the laboratories."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Peer Support Leader in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Learned a lot of skills by reviewing other people", "cons": "It feels bad to have to mark down people on the job"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Had a great time", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Student Ambassador in Bournemouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Got to meet lots of nice people and had a variety of roles, which allowed me to gain experience in different capacities.
