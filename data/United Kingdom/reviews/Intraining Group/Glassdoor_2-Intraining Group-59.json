A short sighted financial win with far reaching consequences for operational performance. This misguided strategy has seen an exodus of experienced, knowledgeable staff and heaped misery on an already demoralised workforce. The resulting knowledge drain has forced the business to backfill vacancies with interim and temporary staff in a desperate attempt to shore up the depleted infrastructure. A shameful spending spree has seen an endless parade of consultants brought in to pick over the wreckage and support clearly overwhelmed Directors.\r\n\r\nStaff at risk of redundancy are invited to reapply for roles with impossibly high workloads to cover staff losses elsewhere and some have been asked to sign new contracts with increased working hours and reduced leave. Maybe this explains the embarrassingly low levels of staff willing to reapply. Surprised? Really?\r\n\r\nOne or two of the new influx of Directors arrive with an air of arrogance treating existing employees with disdain. Support staff are not responsible for declining success rates and work exceptionally hard to provide a quality service. Many have seen your 'new' ideas tried in the past and can no doubt provide valuable insight into why they didn't work. Please note; Intraining and Rathbone are NOT colleges. They are complex organisational structures delivering a wide range of contracts across England, Scotland and Wales against multiple UKPRNs. They work with some of the most challenging learners imaginable so don't expect what previously worked for you in the FE sector to work here.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to work for a training provider with poor OFSTED ratings, dire financial woes, ineffective leadership, a chaotic management style and a severley depleted workforce then you've found it.
