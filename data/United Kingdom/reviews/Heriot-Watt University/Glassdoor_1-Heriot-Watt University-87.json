Example of unethical behaviour, adding the name of your second supervisor on the paper even though he has no idea what the research is about. They say that your supervisor has no influence on your examiner, YES they do. It is kind of like a gang but within an academic that it should has a \u201chigh standard\u201d of moral. The deal is, they examine each other students and if the supervisor says they are good to pass, then the examiner will let you pass. \r\n3) If you have an issue with your supervisor and you escalate it to the university, the university still will take the supervisor side even if he is wrong because he is bringing funding to the university. The university will not allow you to submit your thesis unless the supervisor approve even though you already filed a complaint against the supervisor saying that he does not want you to submit your thesis because he is getting money on every month you stay in the university. \r\n4) The complaint department in the university is understaffed and the reason for that the supervisors are the one who is bringing funding to the university. If the university took a stand against every wrong doing brought against the supervisors by the students then the university might end up bankrupted.
