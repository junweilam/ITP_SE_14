Then again, when managers have been known to shout at crying employees in public corridors, where not just staff but other students can see, this might be expected.\r\n\r\nDespite claims of diversity, simple factors like keeping toilets clean, safe and accessible are not really important to management, and diversity training that was supposed to be rolled out across sites was cancelled. Alternate training by an ex-police officer included incorrect statements about the Equality Act 2010, bigoted statements, and actions that drove one person in a group training session into a panic attack. When multiple people raised concerns to management, they were ignored. When concerns were raised about new uniform plans that were sexist, culturally insensitive and inaccessible to members of multiple religions, those who raised them were pulled aside for meetings in which they were talked down to and told that plans would not be changing as it was felt that enough discussions had already been had.\r\n\r\nManager might agree to reasonable accommodations under the Equality Act, but it doesn't mean that they'll keep to them. Employees who do ask for accommodations may also be told that no other job would ever accept them, so they should be grateful to have employment at all - even as they are actively being harassed.\r\n\r\nTalking to a high level member of management about diversity issues caused them to quite literally laugh in my face.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the safety of its volunteers, well, Vaughan Martin certainly believes in his job. A good thing to, because after middle management told general assistants to falsify health and safety records regarding the fire safety of a building, Vaughan Martin responded to contact and came down to make sure that management had the building made safe and fire exits cleared. Management were noticeably angry with the general assistants for several days, but as they couldn't identify the whistleblower for certain no recriminations ever occurred."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Aberage", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "23 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Programmer Director in Southampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good holiday and pension - good working environment", "cons": "Non academic staff not able to progress easily"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "PhD student in Southampton", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "2 Aug 2022", "job_title": "PhD Student in Southampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great opportunities for extra income", "cons": "I am not experienced enough to know these"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great benefits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Administrative Officer in Southampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay for what you do, loads of holiday, you can take flexi if you work late", "cons": "It\u2019s impossible to do stuff easily and quickly as there is so much red tape"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good environment - Average salary", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Software Developer in Southampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Low stress.
