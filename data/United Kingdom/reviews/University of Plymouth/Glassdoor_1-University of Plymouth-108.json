This has resulted in a steady stream of very poor management decisions that have had consequences for finances and recruitment across the board. Like many large public institutions Plymouth is in danger of grinding to a standstill under the weight of its own excessive bureaucracy. This far too often leads to a kind of paralysis in which expensive projects are started but never finished. Rather random decisions are often made on matters which cause serious operational disruption only to be reversed in a few years time. Effective decision making and action on important matters is sometimes completely impossible.
