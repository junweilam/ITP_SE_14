There is an aggressive change journey ahead, and I appreciate that organisations need to progress but keeping staff totally in the dark is a very poor approach. Direction and leadership is non-existent and staff below the IT Leadership team are not encouraged to contribute at all, this means there is no opportunity to influence change. Instead, overpaid contractors arrive out of nowhere and work in isolation on new processes and act surprised when people are not on board!! There are some fantastic people in the department who have great ideas and would love to be involved in shaping the way forward.
