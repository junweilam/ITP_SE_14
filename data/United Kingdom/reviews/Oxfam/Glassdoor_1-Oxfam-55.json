Then you will fit right in at Oxfam!\r\nAlthough most people believe in equality of the sexes, most - understandably - don't want to call themselves feminists and associate with the radical anti-male extremists in the movement, but at Oxfam - where these people have risen to the top through the terrified deference of their intimidated colleagues who don't wish to be 'cancelled' - you are required to call yourself a feminist, and to support feminist organisations, these are literally written into their 'core values'.\r\nOxfam is the sort of Orwellian place where you will be instructed what to think, and if you're even suspected of wrong-think, the authorities and their pole-climbing snitches will be all over you.\r\nThe tragedy is that Oxfam used to be a world-famous humanitarian charity, but they're quickly losing that status, and with it their support - getting woke will see Oxfam go broke, and eventually die a sad insignificant death, but the world will be better for it, real charities will rise again to take its place."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Oxfam review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "6 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Retail Assistant in Eastbourne, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "good teaching \r\nvoluntary \r\nfun \r\nflexible hours\r\nlearnt retail skills", "cons": "lots of volunteers so not enough to do each day"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Supervisor in Hammersmith, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Reimbursement of lunch and travel", "cons": "Low volunteer morale/ lack of stock control"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good working enviroment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Consultant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good communication with colleagues and team members", "cons": "lack of organisation amongst the tasks"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "10 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in King's Lynn, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly environment and helpful colleagues", "cons": "Challenging Customers and busy work pace"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Amazing workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Volunteer in Altrincham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The teams and training that occur here are amazing", "cons": "The shifts may be too short"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "use to be wonderful", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "29 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "excellent colleagues passionate about the cause", "cons": "Senior management are weak\r\nStaff morale is awful"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "19 May 2021", "job_title": "Sales Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Chlilled out job pretty easy", "cons": "Boring sometimes since there's not much to do"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Warm environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "27 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Advisor (HQ) in Oxford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lots of friendly and passionate people, lots of opportunities for staff engagement in terms of organisation strategizing and changes.

Certain business practices could be made more ethical e.g. lack of recycling facilities, products can be priced unfairly (using online prices and adding their P&P fees to calculate the Oxfam item price), aforementioned lack of benefits for volunteers."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Friendly, progressive, human", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Jan 2015", "job_title": " in Oxford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Great training opportunities\r\n- Great opportunity to run large projects\r\n- Amazing people\r\n- They believe in you\r\n- The Oxfam 'magic' - the culture feels worldly, kind and worthwhile\r\n- Reduced levels of process allows you to get on with things quickly", "cons": "- Some politics at senior levels\r\n- Salaries are lower (as you'd expect)\r\n- Some pockets of people with a negative outlook who don't get the 'real mission'!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Feels this is not needed?", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "11 Aug 2015", "job_title": "Manager in Oxford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good for expansion of skills \r\nLeading charity - sets high standards \r\nGood people and nice feel about the place \r\nRespected Brand and quality approach to projects & changes", "cons": "Too complicated has been recognised - but not addressed successfully \r\nPoor man management is not addressed \r\nInefficiency in people churn is frustrating , and limiting \r\nCareer progression is poor"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Very friendly and try to help you get connected within the organisation", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "31 Aug 2015", "job_title": " in Oxford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Everyone I met was very welcoming and supportive, even though I was 'only an intern'.

Heard very strange comments about gender work by senior leaders.\r\n\r\nHead office is surprisingly undiverse and seems to attract tons of new staff who are under-experienced from other sectors and captures people wanting to stay in Oxford which isn't always best people for org. so is sense that many friends hire friends who don't want to commute to London (head hunting or paying consultants).\r\n\r\nNo people strategy in Oxfam for years so bosses rely on good will of staff who are smart and caring people working til burn out as workloads are way too high. Know dozens of colleagues who burnt out and left on really unhappy terms- managers really missing something here.\r\n\r\nBullying is another reason lots of colleagues have talked about for leaving and it's often not dealt with well. Colleagues in some teams have left a lot of feedback about problems with bosses but people complained about never seem to hear that feedback and then eventually they leave of their own accord after loads of their line reports have already left Oxfam.\r\n\r\nWhen you talk to people you know well is really clear salaries aren't even across pay bands, and different divisions and people from outside always get more money for the same jobs because internals have no negotiating power. \r\n\r\nLeadership don't convey that they listen to staff or value them - real sense that a lot of senior leaders are in it for themselves, which you wouldn't expect at Oxfam.
