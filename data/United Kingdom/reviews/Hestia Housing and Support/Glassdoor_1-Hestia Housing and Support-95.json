She is not acknowledging the issues raised, but is saying what she has been programmed to say in the organisations defence. \r\nUnfortunately the problem with this organisation starts at the top with the CEO. He instills FEAR right across head office and then right across the organisation. He is a dinosaur who has been at the organisation over 15 years and during this time he has instilled his dictatorship right across every senior manager and director. This further instills a culture in them to simply ignore what the staff are crying out for and poor practices where if he doesn't like you, you are out!\r\nI have seen enough staff pushed out of the organisation over my time, and others suffer every single day with stress issues that then lead them to go on long term sick leave - He doesn't care!\r\nThe only positive is that the staff in our services work to the best of their ability for the service users despite the horrible culture of this organisation!", "cons": "The organisation talks about The Hestia Approach as if its some kind of unique and earth shattering way of working! The basis of it being to work together, help each other, and collaborate on a common goal. Ummmmmm, why is the organisation so proud of this approach? Surely this is the BASIC way that EVERY NORMAL ORGANISATION works on a daily basis! The fact that they think its revolutionary and new tells us that this organisation has been working under a negative model for the 47 years the organisation has been running!  I think its sad and disappointing that good staff have to put up with such a poor example of a CEO and that he drives his negative cultural values across the organisation, facing good staff out and keeping and promoting those who are his little militant robots! \r\nThe organisation is working in the dark ages and without a change at the top, nothing good will come out of Hestia!\r\nThe Trustees are oblivious to the poor practices of the organisation and I don't understand how they get away with ruining staff lives?\r\nThe organisations moto is 'Empowering people, changing lives' and this may be true when they talk about service users but what about staff?

There is a lot of wastage in which a lot of options chosen have not been cost effective e.g. hiring externally and when hired some get away with extending the time to extract fees;\r\n4. It is a cross between Kids Company scandal and St Mungos strikes, a lot of staff are tired of being bullied due to having to keep justifying what they are doing, there are other staff who don\u2019t receive any training at all and are setup to fail;\r\n5. The Chief Exec\u2019s tactic is to rely on petty and trivial methods to instil fear, he is someone who doesn\u2019t allow questions to be asked at him at conference as he knows he will be confronted with a lot of bad questions;\r\n6. The process in investigating staff for any potential misconduct is an abuse of process, I\u2019ve seen HR make up their mind on decisions without any investigation;\r\n7.
