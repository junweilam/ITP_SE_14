My former (middle) manager was a bully, which was OK, but she was also completely incompetent in all aspects of her job. She even seriously suggested singing to the learners as an innovating teaching technique. \r\nUnfortunately far to many staff do not understand how to read, understand and implement course specifications. This is reflected in poor Ofsted reviews and verification. When they finally had someone (me) who was an important part in creating an Ofsted grade 1 programme (at a different educator), the resistance was unimaginable.  The external verifier praised the work I had did and annihilated the work of the so called expert mentor I was assigned. Sadly, this is kind of thing is inherent within some FE departments.\r\nThe was so little money that instead of buying resources to teach from, staff are told to spend untold hours reinventing the wheel in their own time creating resources that should simply be bought in.

The turn over of staff is high and many people have complained and reported the behaviour of management but it never changes, just gets over looked.

Not for a group interview which would perhaps justify this choice, but rather to have all interviewees just hang around for three hours for when this disorganised bunch feel like seeing you for the ten minute interview you receive. As if you have nothing better to do all day. Their inability to organise themselves (especially in the HR department) where they won't disclose any helpful information, such as oh I don't know,  when might the start date be, as well as their contempt for the interviewees is immediately evident at the start of the unnecessarily long-winded and rediculous interview process.  I attended an interview a couple of years back during a sweltering summer, and gave a presentation in a suit, in a hot room. They all had their glass of water that they frequently sipped without even considering offering the performer (me) anything to drink. I had to ask after I could no longer get words out due to such a dry throat from the heat. Others I know have experienced the total disregard for the feelings of others during the interview process and have been shown the total disinterest in the people who apply for a job. I might understand if this was a top job at Buckingham Palace, but frankly its for a sinking ship of an organisation, where senior members often comment on the abnormally high rate of full time staff that are off on long term sickness. Its doubtful whether they will have many high value members of staff starting at the college any time soon given the way they treat staff members from the off, where most decent organisations at least try and sell their better sides at the beginning. Incompetence is evidently rife, staff moral is low. Senior staff members make themselves as unapproachable and as difficult to get hold of as Barak Obama for some unexplainable reason. Perhaps its an easier day to get through if all they do is keep out the way without considering the place may benefit from having some kind of effective leadership and organisational improvements to its processes of human resources and staff management. If you are a hard worked are a high value potential staff member they will probably overlook you, or even more likely hack you off so much by their obsurd recruitment disorganisation that you'll go somewhere else where you will be fully utilised and appreciated.
