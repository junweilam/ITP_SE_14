Considering that this company creates the qualifying standard for all HR professionals they really don't practice what they preach.\r\n\r\nI took the job there because my partner works in HR and she said that they would be a decent employer. How wrong she was. After having sacked a number of people who made up my department me and my manager were hired. Even though my hours were 9 to 5 I was regularly expected to work extra hours with no compensation. My manager however was given days in lieu for his overtime. When I had a baby, even though I had booked time off I was expected to come in the next day, because technically I wasn't entitled to Paternity Leave. This was mainly due to the fact that my manager was on holiday skiing, even though I let him know that the birth was imminent. \r\n\r\nThere was also a culture of selective \"diversity\". If you are black, don't expect to get promoted (there were no black managers, even though there were a number of black people who had worked there for 10 years or more),and don't expect more than a 1% pay rise, don't expect to be given a permanent job before the 2 year mark if you are hired as a temp. Also if you are black and your position is made redundant, don't expect them to give you a redundancy payment. You will more than likely be given the choice of working in Customer Services and if this isn't to your liking you will have to leave with a month's notice as they offered you an alternative role which you turned down. If you are black and you are bullied by your managers and complain to HR don't expect any support, as there will be none. What you should expect is for your managers and HR to collude on a strategy on how to manage you out.\r\n\r\nThe majority of this companies' revenue isn't made from selling HR courses, it is actually made from advising companies on how to keep their staff in line and advising them on how much they can get away with. Considering that this company sets the HR standards in the UK, it's no wonder there are so many terrible work places out there.\r\n\r\nThis company was so bad that for the sake of my mental health I had to leave, giving no notice. I've never done that before, but I couldn't take working there any more. On Sunday evenings I couldn't eat and I couldn't sleep knowing I had to go into this nightmare on Monday.\r\n\r\nTo anyone out there looking at this company for future employment, I'd say approach with caution. To any black people out there I'd say avoid like the plague."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Can't believe this is an HR company", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Wimbledon, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some amazing people to work with who are genuinely passionate about what they do", "cons": "Honestly dismayed that they can be telling other organisations how to handle bullying and wellbeing when the organisation itself doesn't follow their own advice.
