It has been an unmitigated failure, and is a huge drawback of working for this company. \r\n\r\nThe issues caused by SAP are staggering and difficult to keep track of. Because SHA tried to implement SAP in a cost effective manner, they ended up vastly under-investing in critical elements. There is no tailoring of the generically presented system ('vanilla SAP'), which is an issue as social housing is a unique environment from a service delivery and CRM perspective, whereas vanilla SAP is more geared towards providing a solution for manufacturing industries. Thus, the system uses corporate nonsensical buzzwords and methods of handling accounts which absolutely do not reflect industry practice. \r\n\r\nHere are just some examples of the more specific issues faced by staff:\r\n\r\nNo rent statements have been issued since it was implemented in August 2016, and if a resident insists on a rent statement it has to be prepared manually in a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nThe rent and calculations for accounts are hard to use, and often completely wrong. Mostly because the system was never designed to understand housing benefit payments, and this has a very convoluted workaround which a computer cannot make sense of.\r\n\r\nSAP cannot interface with Local Authorities Housing benefit systems so payments are missed, lost or misattributed. \r\n\r\nDirect debits do not work reliably, and for a long time following the implementation did not work at all. Front line staff are now preferring standing order. \r\n\r\nThe front end system of SAP requires far more testing and money spent on it. Each customer account is a total mess of information, with no discernible way to separate notes left between differing departments, with information left by staff often going into the wrong account entirely.  This needs looking at as from a compliance (DPA) point of view the breaches are serious. \r\n\r\nFrom a usability point of view, the view of a customers account within SAP CIC does not display appropriate information to the user (as stated before this is likely because the system was never designed to be used by a HA) and the user often has to go trawling around back end systems to find obviously relevant data (e.g tenancy start date, account balance, property type etc).
