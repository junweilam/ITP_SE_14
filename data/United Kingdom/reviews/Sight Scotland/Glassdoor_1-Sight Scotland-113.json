The job would be fine for someone who wants to come in, put their head phones on, work to a basic standard and not be spoken to all day. If you expect anything more from an employer, like being invested in (don't let the Investors In People logo fool you) or listened to, go elsewhere. I also agree with others who have said that it's far from great for disabled people and other minorities.
