I love the community feel and the work we do is very valuable.", "cons": "The things I find about chailey heritage that could do with reviewing is the fact the dispite working mothers make up a good portion of the workforce there isn't much in place to support them. The hours are not childcare/school friendly and many women I know unfortunately have had to change jobs or cut drastically down on hours becouse of this. I could write endlessly about this subject but I really think chailey could benefit from and retain/recruit so much from putting in place something for working mothers/parents. Also the lack of organised activities for special holidays for young people especially for those who cannot go home. Lastly I'd like to mention the environment for newcomers, it can be though to settle it at the start, there is definitely a lack of initial showing around, I think newcomers would benefit from having one designated person to explain everything rather than just following different people around each shift. It doesn't work, I experienced a rocky settle it at the start of my time there and have spoken to many newcomers who felt the same. A little bit lost and having to fend for yourself when it comes to learning everything."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "A rewarding job with amazing YP.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Contractor, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Support Worker in Balcombe, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "A homely environment working on the bungalows You are able to develop a variety of clinical skills through training.
