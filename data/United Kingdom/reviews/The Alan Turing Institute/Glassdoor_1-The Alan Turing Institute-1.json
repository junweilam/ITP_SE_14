Below the glossy surface you find capricious behaviours, malicious criticism and sarcasm in face-to-face interactions. A toxic culture. The institute offers an external mental health counselling service but nobody addresses the root causes of the poor mental health of the staff. Senior staff take no responsibility for their decisions or actions. Everything is always the fault of the junior members. Poor communication. Lack of support. Lack of professional processes. Lack of professionalism. Micromanagement. A pretty much pointless HR department. My understanding is that there are known repeat offenders here that are, for some reason, immune from any HR action. The Alan Turing Institute revolves around a \u201cprivileged\u201d core group of people that joined around the time it was founded. Everyone else is treated as a dispensable commodity. Professional processes and integrity do not seem to apply to them. And all this is on charity money. If you are brave enough to take up a job here make sure that you will be paid because not everyone gets paid in their first month. And nobody cares. The institute mostly works with contractors. It has no long-term approach towards its staff. If you are looking for a stable long-term position, make sure you give this one a miss. Definitely do not turn down other job offers for this one. Taking up a job here has been one of my big mistakes and I hope that this review will make others think twice before they decide to work for this institute. Do not let unprofessional people waste your time and your money."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Dynamic environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 May 2023", "job_title": "Research Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meeting new people every day", "cons": "Many people work in another city."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "26 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Receptionist in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good pay for the work", "cons": "Not a very inclusive workspace"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Not a bad place but pay/pay review should be better.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "2 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Research Associate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good colleagues, very smart people.", "cons": "Salary is better than some academic positions depending on role, but still well below what it should be."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Turing review", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "1 Nov 2022", "job_title": "Programme Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Relaxed, friendly environment and colleagues", "cons": "Pay could be better (charity/academia\u2026)"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Full of clerks", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "31 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some interesting projects despite a level of disorganization I had never experienced.", "cons": "Clerks with fancy titles such as project or partnership managers do little to nothing yet behave as owners of the institute.
