In the last staff survey in 2018, two thirds of staff said they had not been bullied in the preceding 12 months, meaning that every third staff member had experienced bullying. One in three. This survey was largely buried and nothing was done to tackle this clear issue. There is widespread demotivation, no doubt related to fact the bullying epidemic is ignored.\r\n\r\nLike a big, spoilt child which ignores any rules that don't suit it. The senior leadership are delusional at best; 2018 was a disastrous year and the entire strategy was delayed for the duration of the year due to widespread chaos and confusion, and not nearly enough thought had been put into resourcing the very unclear strategy, however after a year of going round in circles with senior leadership pulling the rug from under teams on a weekly basis as they kept changing their minds, somehow the annual report to the trustees was full of successes, praise and green lights. By October 2019, the staff still hadn't been given a copy of the 2019 business plan; how anyone is meant to know what they're meant to be accountable for this year is as mystery, but the bigger mystery is how a business plan can be reported against to trustees by staff that haven't even seen it without some serious manipulation of the truth.\r\n\r\nStill today, supporters are being told of amazing reach to millions of donkeys in 40 countries in the website and in newsletters, but the reality is that the charity struggles to do anything at all in less than 20 countries (much of it pretty meaningless)  and they stopped counting donkeys reached back in 2016 when the first restructure of the global team resulted in a massacre of capacity. They pretend to be a major international development charity and many of the delusional senior managers honestly believe it is true - in reality, after massacring the majority of the global programming staff in the UK global team, all the Indian and Egyptian staff, most of the Ethiopian, Kenyan and Mexican staff, and the majority of funded partnerships over the last 12 months, there is practically nothing left, and certainly nothing to brag about. Don't expect to actually help any donkeys globally; the focus now is partnering with 'big names' at all costs regardless of how ineffective the actual project is, and meaningful advocacy is blocked in favour of talk-shop political events where the directors can further their own careers on the charity's dime.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice the Glassdoor reviews took a discernable dip after Mike Baker became the CEO in 2016. Have a look at World Animal Protection's Glassdoor reviews from around 2015 to 2016 to see what a mess he created there as CEO before he was removed from there and subsequently became The Donkey Sanctuary's CEO. He has effectively done the same again; giving jobs to 'the boys' and finding ways to (often horrifically unfairly) forcing out those who question the chaos. Conflicts of interest all over the place.\r\n\r\nThe rhetoric you will hear at the application stage is full of exaggerated truths. You won't get any freedom to actually do your job (the chances are very high that the job description won't match the actual role whatsoever so ask lots of questions at these interview as several people recently have come a cropper due to ineptly written job descriptions), and HR will be as supportive as a paper towel in a typhoon... if you're lucky. One day, they might employ some HR staff who've read their woeful collection of outdated and non-compliant policies, but don't bank on it anytime soon.\r\n\r\nTerrible career opportunities - professional development will be in your own hands and the Learning and Development team are only in it for the compliance-related training with very little learner-focused stuff. Performance management processes stopped 3 years ago (coincidentally when Mike started and three chaos ensured...) and there is no accountability for under performance. Managers are not well trained or inducted, and many are very poor, blocking positions for years which someone capable could be doing. Career progress requires you to leave the charity, but finding alternative work in East Devon is easier said than done.\r\n\r\nIf you're prepared to tolerate all this, ignore the toxicity and keep your head down, it is possible to make a go of it here. Just expect very little. If you'd need to move house to work in Sidmouth, don't sell up - rent somewhere for the first 6 months to make absolutely sure you can handle the chaos, bullying and rug-pulling before you commit to anything long term."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Not what you'd expect", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Exeter, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Cute donkeys, lovely setting, nice cafe for lunch", "cons": "Surprisingly backbiting and bullying culture"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "You Never Leave", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Office Based Staff in Sidmouth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The Sanctuary is a positive place to work with friendly staff and a wonderful charity.
