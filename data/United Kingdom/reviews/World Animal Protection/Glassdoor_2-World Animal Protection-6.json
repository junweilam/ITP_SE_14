Comments according to which we are not delivering AT ALL, make me and my own line of work look bad and I think that as much accountability we're asking management to have, there should be some of that as well on us, the reviewers. \r\n\r\nThese reviews present a very gloom picture that it is far from my experience here so I will take this chance to present my view of this organisation. Hopefully I can focus on the things I consider to be factual, in hope that future reviews do comment on these as well. Ultimately this is a forum to share opinions but I insist on having some responsibility for people who are currently employed by the organisation that are making an effort to deliver on their own jobs and that want some things to change. That is the position I am in. \r\n\r\nIN *MY OPINION*, WSPA has very competitive salaries which are complemented by a fairly good pension plan. I can say that in my case the difference between my salary in another organisation and WSPA is substantial as I currently earn 1.5 times what I earned some 3 years ago and I did not have access to a pension plan. In addition to the salary itself, I was presented upon arrival with a series of benefits, such as loans for transport and a bike scheme, among a few others. It is easy to take for granted that the location of the office is great, accessible to the main lines and in Central London. Similar organisations with offices in places like Surrey and beyond would make it impossible for me to work in the sector. The office itself is organised, has a modern look and resources (software, printers etc.) are constantly updated. I have also been provided with opportunities to enhance my skills and advance in my career, which I can't take for granted. \r\n\r\nThe job is very flexible. I have never had a discussion with my line manager about working from home from time to time in situations like having to attend an ill relative or even receive a parcel. I have also the flexibility to come at 8.00 AM and leave at 4.00 PM (normally 9.00AM to 5.00 PM) which means I can balance quite well work with life. True, I had longer days and stressful periods where this doesn't apply and I end up pulling a 8.00-8.00, but I can confidently say that this is not the rule for me and certainly nothing I have seen managers encouraging. I know that there is some inconsistency in the way that the work from home scheme is applied, but for people like me having the liberty to agree on the scheme is priceless. \r\n\r\nI have never found trouble arranging my annual leave and the office closes for a week in Christmas so even then the leave entitlement is slightly better than it is in other organisations. I am also aware of current study leave being allowed and members of my team with academic pressure have been able to continue with their studies thanks to the organisation's flexible approach to work. \r\n\r\nMany people have made reference to managers simply refusing to recognise the union. I am aware of the existence of a committee that is working with management to get the union recognised and I understand from him that this is a process with some complexities and delays, but I have never heard from them that management have closed the door for conversation and so they have informed in meetings, emails and newsletters. The fact that people here are continuing to simply write \"the union is not recognised\" is also a statement that goes against colleagues that ARE working to make this possible. This is another example of trigger happy comments that are really not helping us to change things that need to be changed. If you don't know about the union process, speak to the union people, they're no longer hiding in a closet. If you think you're doing us/them any favours by simply saying that there is a direct refusal to recognition you are not acknowledging any of their work. That is irresponsible.   \r\n\r\nI do enjoy what I do and in my team there is generally and atmosphere of respect and good cooperation. I do not have to worry about someone else working on the same thing so there is no competition. There are expectations, and these are quite high, but the expectations are not set on a personal basis, which is why I think I could never do this for the private sector. As such the atmosphere is challenging, but relaxed. As expressed before, there have been days or periods of the year in my case where I certainly know when these days are coming, but in my line of work, this is not just WSPA, this is everywhere. \r\n\r\nMany others have written before that the people are the best part of WSPA. This is most true and WSPA is the kind of organisation where you can relate to people and even make a few friends down the road.", "cons": "I think that there is a serious problem of communication and that decision and the decision making process need to involve more staff that will be ultimately affected (positively or negatively) by these decisions. \r\n\r\nSome of the reviews here have presented a very critic view of the campaign work of the organisation and I think that in some cases they have a point that I don't think I can't add anything substantial. This needs urgent attention and campaign decisions need specific impact assessments so that some of the negative situations described can be avoided. I have to say that I have had the chance to speak to my GLT member about the impact of these decisions and I have always had a reply in the formality of team meetings. While I don't always agree with the reasoning, I had my chance to present my views and answers to my somewhat difficult questions have been provided. \r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think that the kind of work that this organisation does is not just narrowed down to campaign work. In the time that I have been working here some substantial political gains have achieved, with impact at the heart of UN or with our work with OIE. I am convinced that these achievements have the potential to change the situation for animals around the world. Some current work in WSPA is aiming to that effect and therefore, colleagues of ours are making an effort When our organisation is described as utterly ineffective I don't think we are taking into consideration people who are working on these departments or people who are working in resources allowing this work to take place. I certainly don't feel comfortable describing my job as ineffective. \r\n\r\nI think that a good part of the problem is the fact that there is a perceivable distance between decision makers and staff executing these decisions."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Ruthless.

What is also extraordinary is that the Board, who promised all the right things about wanting to be more involved, recognised that they had let people down, etc etc are either not bothered or (more possibly) oblivious to the ongoing misery which characterises the working environment. They may be helped in this regard by having a very artificial perspective on the State of WAP since it is all neatly and soothingly fed to them through the mouth of the CEO, now practiced in the art of explaining away any murmurings of discontent as the necessary and expected ripples issuing from the restructure (aka Night of the Long Knives). \n\nHe offers up this silence as being an indication of support for the programme of change. In fact, what it represents is yet another manifestation of the fear of speaking out which has paralysed the organisation over the past two years and enabled the CEO to impose his authority.

The inconsistent recruitment policy is a long term cause of frustration amongst middle and junior management staff who see people get given jobs, whilst other position are advertised externally and internal candidates are told not to apply. \r\n\r\nThis review and all the others written on here are considered to be the views of a couple of 'troublemakers' - SMT listen to your staff. We are not troublemakers, we want to work in a constructive environment which doesn't pit staff at junior levels against each other, which in turn creates an atmosphere of fear and distrust. This only results in teams which won\u2019t communicate because they feel they are competing with one another. This all comes down to the fact that the CEO won\u2019t decide who ultimately makes decisions, should the communications team guide campaigns, should policy or campaigns come first? No one will make the decision so the internal infighting to see who comes out on top is horrendous. \r\n\r\nSMT - It is good that you have finally chosen to recognise the Union, but now you have to listen to what the Union say and make changes which show that you genuinely care about your staff. \r\n\r\nSecondly, please actually do something to make the lives of animals better. I really don't understand how WAP hasn't been investigated by the Charity Commission or a similar body for misuse of charity funds. The reporting system asks for staff to indicate how many animals have been 'saved' by the work of WAP. The real answer is shockingly low, a handful of bears that are taken into a sanctuary in Romania are the only real beneficiaries of WAP's millions. And this case study is then used as the fundraising appeal to generate excessive amounts of money which is ploughed back into a series of endless board meetings and strategy workshops. I don't know how many times each country office can say that a new sanctuary enclosure needs to be built before someone questions exactly how much money actually goes to the sanctuary (a fraction of what is raised). \r\n\r\nIt is often mentioned that charity funds have been used inappropriately, be it to pay for large workshops which require staff from all around the world to fly to the UK to stay in four star hotels, or to pay for the rent on a London flat for a member of SMT. Almost like the MP's expenses scandal it seems that this can\u2019t go on forever without members of the public finding out. \r\n\r\nAs another reviewer mentioned I have known staff who loved WAP before joining, and donated on a monthly basis - only to join the organisation and immediately cancel their direct debit once they understand how their donation is used.
