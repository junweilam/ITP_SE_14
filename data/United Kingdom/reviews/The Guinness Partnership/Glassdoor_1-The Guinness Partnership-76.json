Firstly the low reviews are all true, I worked for TGP (as its now known) for 3 and a half years and it started off as the best job I ever had with some of the best people I've ever worked with but my did that change quickly. All of TGP's issues are down to the changing of the CEO and constant changes in my opinion, Ms Simmons probably wanted to leave a lasting impression after she took over and she certainly achieved it. I'm not sure if her vision was one of an organisation that is criminally incompetent, festers and harbours bullying and intimidation and devoid of any decency but that's exactly whats been achieved. Before HR come back to me with their generic and meaningless response about 'how sorry they are to hear this', let me just say that I have no grudges and nothing to gain but you are also part of the problem. I left the organisation as I came to the conclusion that I valued my time, principles and sanity above the supposed security of a job, I was constantly fixing mistakes made by people and got no thanks for it, in fact quite the opposite. There's a cliquishness across the organisation and if you're not in it you'll soon know. I thankfully found a role with an organisation that not only cares about its employees but also the people they serve. There IS a culture of bullying whether you want to admit it or not and a collection of some of the most useless and incompetent people I've ever had the misfortune to work with. The constant changes and restructures - which happen about every 12 months - has resulted in TGP losing its best and brightest replacing them with worst of the worst. Some of the brown nosing in the organisation is nauseating and unfortunately its those people that get ahead - you only need to look at the reviews from the employees who have willingly put in their job titles and given it a 5 star rating. I think the worst thing however is how they treat their tenants and occupants, again you only need to google the Guinness partnership and click the news tab to see how many times they've made the news across the country. I probably wouldn't have gone out of my way to write this review if the company was making some inroads, they constantly bang on about saving money and the need for change but the amount of money  they are haemorrhaging is unbelievable. Looking at them you'd never think they were a provider of social housing as they act more like a banking corporation but that's exactly what they're trying to model themselves as. I could go on and on but suffice to say its an organisation best avoided."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not a career place", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Jan 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "* nice people \r\n* good selection of offices across the UK (London, Bristol, Milton Keynes, Oldham etc.) \r\n* good selection of roles", "cons": "* some employees are absolute deadwood and the company is not really a meritocracy \r\n* high levels of job instability (i.e. a lot of redundancies and \"transitions\") \r\n* big difference in pay and treatment between different employees \r\n* stupid/sometimes enraging policies and financial management\r\n* focus on customers and not employees"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great pay but no career progression!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "15 Feb 2015", "job_title": "Infrastructure and Desktop Analyst in Oldham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great pay, great benefits, great transport links near Oldham office, great staff, great working environment.", "cons": "No career progression, communication between team is not good in IT services.
