I've had a permanent position at a previous institution (tier 1 research university overseas), and post-docs. I moved to the University of Lincoln for family reasons. I know a lot of other researchers at other institutions in the UK and overseas, so this review is comparative.\r\n\r\nSo that readers can estimate how I value various aspects of my position, I should state that I view both research and teaching as equally important parts of an academic's job, but I am more accomplished as a researcher than as a teacher - for example, I have several 4* research outputs and have won major grants. The third role for academics, that of academic administration, I dislike and would rather spend my time on teaching and research.\r\n\r\n\r\n-= Balance between teaching and research =-\r\nThis varies between schools within the college. At my school it is broadly in line with my previous institution (approximately 10% higher). Unlike my previous institution, academics here in my school seem to really care about teaching well, which is wonderful. There is friendship and mutual support between academics, and frequent interaction between the students and the academics. Although the number of contact hours is comparable with my previous institution, the hours here are more enjoyable - almost half are spent small group/tutorial teaching and supervising projects, which I prefer to lecturing.\r\n\r\nThe university is quite prone to following the latest fads in pedagogy, which in my opinion usually impede good teaching and create a significant bureaucratic burden on academics. Fortunately, it appears to me that as long as a school is teaching \"well\" (which of course means scoring well in the NSS) the university is happy on the whole to let the school's director of teaching interpret how strictly these fads are followed. In my school we have an excellent director of teaching, who works closely with the students to make sure their needs are met, and so we are largely protected from too much pointless bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I enjoy teaching at the University of Lincoln, and I don't feel that teaching encroaches significantly on my research time. If I won the lottery, I would ask only for a 1 course teaching load reduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n-= Academic administration =-\r\nThis is higher than my previous institution, and higher than other UKHEI's in my subject. It is high because the College of Science is relatively new, the university is ambitious but relatively inexperienced at responding to government targets and so tends to overreact to them, and because our school is small so everyone ends up with a big administrative role.\r\n\r\n\r\n-= Work-life balance =-\r\nThis is where the University of Lincoln scores exceptionally well. The city of Lincoln is beautiful. It has a medieval centre with a huge cathedral, and two large parks (\"commons\") that are full of horses. Family houses are affordable in safe neighbourhoods near the centre and the commons, meaning you can walk to work, walk to the city centre for shopping, and walk to a common, with each being less than a 10 minute walk. The university is in the centre of the city, set around an attractive marina. There are good schools near to the university. Lincoln is about 2 hours from London by train, and is commutable from Nottingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n-= Job security and career opportunities =-\r\nThe university appears to be financially stable, even after covid. Certainly I've not heard any rumours of problems now, or in the foreseeable future. Mary Stuart (our previous VC who just retired) was excellent, and made a point during covid of prioritising everyone keeping their jobs. The university have been good about promoting me, but I have heard that it is difficult to be promoted above senior lecturer without a big grant.", "cons": "-= Salary =-\r\nThis is below the sector average. Because the cost of living is lower in Lincoln (e.g. nice houses are approx. half the price they would be in the South East), it is not something I particularly noticed. Despite the lower salary, my disposable income went up when I moved here.\r\n\r\n\r\n-= Some levels of senior management =-\r\nThis is a new university, trying to take on some of the Russel Group. This means senior management are often pushing schools quite hard with targets. There is also a lack of experience among some levels of senior management about how best to achieve their aims. For example, significant grants are won by people with established research track records, and so if the university wants to win big grants they need to protect the research time of their academics and wait several years; they need to provide money so that people can start labs, or travel to conferences. This increase in grants can't be achieved simply by imposing targets on schools for the number of grants applied for. I should add that since I joined, there have been significant positive moves within senior management towards trying to listen to views like the one expressed her, so the university appears for now to be moving in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n-= Bureaucratic burden =-\r\nThis is a new university, with many non-academic staff tasked with improving various metrics (all of which require academic time) and students (who require academic time). The result is a large time burden on academics. It is not, at the moment, excessive, but the university will need to monitor this quite closely."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great Employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "10 May 2022", "job_title": "Project Coordinator in Lincoln, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great staff perks, flexible working", "cons": "Lack of office space and fixed term contract"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Some great people and dynamism, but held back by box-tick management", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Senior Lecturer in Lincoln, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is a very young uni, it is newer than the 1992 \"new\" unis so isn't in the same box as them.
