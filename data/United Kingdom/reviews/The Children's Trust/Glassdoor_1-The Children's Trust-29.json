In fact they have made it worst by not telling that junior member of staff to stop undermining their line manager and reporting false information to her management reporting line. I love the trust I care about the cause and I live in the village so am passionate about it.\r\nBut I feel let down that this appalling behaviour is allowed to go on and in the long term Sadly both my manager and I will have to review our positions and possibly walk away and that would be a great loss to the trust.
