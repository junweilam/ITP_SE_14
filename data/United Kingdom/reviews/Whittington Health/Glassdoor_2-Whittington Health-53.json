I joined the trust in Nov, 2018 and would be leaving in January, 2019. Worst decision l ever made was joining this trust. Lazy managers, Blame culture at its peak. It's all about budget and cuts to the point brown paper are been used for the job because white paper are too expensive. Business mileage does not get paid. You literally have to chase everything . Oh, the worst nightmare is the HR Team whom l had to escalate to the director of workforce before my emails was responded to and actioned. I should have known from the recruitment process that the trust was in a big mess. From the onset that i was told a Band 5 nurse will be signing me (Band 6  ) off on some skills (PEG); l knew this trust was in a big mess. Got to find out that the band 5 nurse got some bad habits and needs a refresher course. That was fed back.", "cons": "Do not be deceived by their job adverts. Trainings are not available as they get cancelled everytime, or no dates available. I have to buy gloves, handgel in carrying out my job. Never got a mobile phone or laptop until l sent in my resignation letter. No lone working policy; as 1nurse is doing a visit btw 5pm- 12pm at midnight. You get a cheap security alarm for working during 5pm- 12pm at midnight. Oh, l got trained by the Band 8 for syringe driver during shift. The Band 7 said there was no training for end of life care. Blimey! Worst place to work! They do not look after their staff. You don't get overtime pay but accumulation of TOIL (time off in lieu).  Breaks do not exist ofcourse (NHS). \r\nMassive workload, staff shortages. Team is dependant on Agency / Bank workers whom we literally have to beg daily to do a shift with us; whilst we put them in wherever area/ location they want; and give them whatever patient they want. If you try to challenge things, you get ignored and you get played on (POLITICS). Staffs with unprofessional behaviours and bad habits do get away with it (favoritism). Biased rotas is done, where the favourite staff member get to co-ordinates most of the time. This was escalated to the band 8 to check the health roster and he did absolutely nothing!! I have being told that \"l am too eager\". If you want a job where you lose all your enthusiasm, motivations, aspirations, assertiveness, proactiveness for nursing .... then join this trust. I am leaving because l love my nursing career and believe l should get the right support. Fortunately, l got a better offer which was a blessing in disguise. At least that compensated for the 2months l wasted at this trust.
