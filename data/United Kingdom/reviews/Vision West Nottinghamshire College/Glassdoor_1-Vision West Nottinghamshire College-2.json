The team i worked within were so welcoming and always there to help me when needed, they made the transition easy and helped build my confidence quickly! Managerial support has been great throughout, regular catch ups, constructive criticism where needed but praised and encouraged. i always felt i could go to my manager with any issues i had, the support was great and was the kind of support you'd hope for from a manager. The facilities at the Derby Road site are great, lots of food options and car parking spaces have never been an issue.
