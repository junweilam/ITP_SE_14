Students have immense power and to avoid complaints they are kept happy resulting in cutting course content and lowering standards. Students repay by being lazy, not motivated and secure to end up with a degree. The way staff is treated by management is poor. Admin work is immense. Management, during the recent years, have made emarassing choices bringing the University and the moral of staff at a record low. Table leagues are affected by that (please check on websites). Staff and lecturers have no dignity, they are asked to be servants of students and dolls in the hand of management. Contact time is crazy high and there is no time for reasearch but UCLan put you underpressure for the incoming REF. Research is trivial and of low level and managers give out to you for this.. but there is no money for anything. PhD students are all self funded and very weak. Also managment protects certain minorities to avoid complaints and this ends up in a discrimination of a big portion  of staff not belonging to minorities. Location-wise is a disaster.
