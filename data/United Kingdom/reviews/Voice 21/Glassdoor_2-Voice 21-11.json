It's a really forward-thinking, inclusive environment to work in. The team is very vibrant and the culture is very solution lead, which most people embrace, making it a great thing to be part of. The organisation are on a journey and has already seen significant growth, so there is a lot of scope and potential to be involved in areas of the organisation that may not be available in another organisation. For the first time ever (for me) my tech and induction plan were ready on day 1, which is a refreshing change! There is a focus on regularly updating the team on the organisational priorities and team news, plus you consistently get the opportunity to ask the management questions, which I appreciate the opportunity to do.", "cons": "Working remotely and coming together for bigger things, works well for me but I could see that some people would need to consider that."}]]
