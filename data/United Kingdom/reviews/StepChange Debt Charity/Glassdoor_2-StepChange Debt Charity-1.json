At Step Change, everything we do is geared towards helping people in desperate need of financial advice. Our help and support have helped save people's lives (as our clients tell us regularly). A couple of years ago, one of my friends disclosed they were struggling financially. He didn't know how he would tell his pregnant girlfriend - this was giving him anxiety, and he couldn't sleep. He knew I worked at Step Change and asked for my advice, it was simple \"give us a call or go on our website, and we'll support you every step of the way\". Fast forward two years, and he's on a debt solution and will be debt-free within three years. He couldn't be more thankful for the help Step Change provided him. THIS IS JOB SATISFACTION. \r\n\r\nI know from experience that other Leeds based organisations proactively identify their most engaged employees and ask them to complete positive GD reviews. They do this even just two weeks after joining their company (I mean, who isn't optimistic about their new role just two weeks in?). Step Change doesn't do anything like this - and maybe that's a bit naive, but at least it's more honest.\r\n\r\nSome  people may have genuinely had a bad experience and left for valid reasons - that happens in every organisation - but I also think a large portion probably left under a cloud due to under performance or similar. There will also be people who have been here years and years who remember the charity as a small operation with 8% pay rises - those days are long gone. The Charity has had to become more commercial and that isn\u2019t for everyone but some prefer to stick around and be negative rather than find a organisation more suitable for them.\r\n\r\nPlease remember, everyone's experience is relative to them. We're all inherently biased, and every review should be viewed through that lens. \r\n\r\nThat said, alongside the extreme job satisfaction you get working at Step Change, the people are another huge positive. You'll struggle to find anyone at Step Change that doesn't genuinely care about helping people; that's why they joined in the first place. We have some proper laughs with each other, and I can genuinely say that some of my colleagues are now my best friends. \r\n\r\nI also couldn't have asked for more from a career development perspective, either. Suppose you are willing to put the work in and 'knock-on doors' that you want to open. In that case, you will find countless people willing to put in their own time to help you either through mentoring or introducing you to the right people within the business. Some people sit there waiting for someone to do it for them and then complain that they don't 'get developed'. We're all the masters of our own career, but it's great to have some help along the way - which you get at Step Change. \r\n\r\nI know I could probably get paid slightly higher elsewhere for what I do. Still, you can't put a price on working for a genuinely socially driven organisation, especially when you get to work with your friends every day and have a clear career path ahead of you. \r\n\r\nWe've also just moved to a new office in Leeds, which feels like a great place to work, with lots of natural light and contemporary fixtures and fittings. The balance between working from home and in the office is excellent, especially when you genuinely enjoy being in such a friendly and smart environment.", "cons": "Now for the not so good. \r\n\r\nFirstly, and this is an important point, Step Change is a not-for-profit organisation, so every penny counts and is carefully accounted for. Suppose you're coming from, say, a big corporate bank. In that case, you'll be used to (or maybe not) significant investments in technology that are delivered whenever needed. That is not the reality at Step Change. Don't get me wrong, we're improving things all the time, but there's only so much money to go around. It can be frustrating when the technology you need for your specific role gets pushed to the back of the queue by something else. That said, if you take a step back and look at the bigger picture, you will understand why that happened. It's generally because something needed to change for compliance or a change in regulation that meant systems in another team had to change. The result is that you sometimes have to work with slow and cumbersome tools, and I can understand why people get frustrated at this. Things are moving in the right direction, but the technology I use day-to-day is the only reason I've not given a 5-star rating. However, I expect this to change in the not too distant future. \r\n\r\nThe other con I have is difficult to define, but let me try. Step Change is a charity for our clients i.e. we provide a free service to those who are most in need. Though Step Change is not a charity for employees, people shouldn't expect it to be. Many of the operational roles are traditional call centre-type roles. I think some people join and are surprised they have KPIs and performance targets. These targets make perfect sense as Step Change (like any other business) has to be as efficient as possible to break even at the end of the financial year and continue operating. So my advice is to join with your eyes open and understand that you will have performance targets to meet. If you don't meet them, you will be coached and performance managed, like in almost any similar business. If you're looking for somewhere you can make up your own rules, then this probably isn't the place for you."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Used to be great", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "21 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Team is great, doing priceless work for people in debt, good options of development and wage increases initally, not so much after a longer service.", "cons": "Senior management is a joke, out of touch with what the frontline staff deal with and need, demoralising decisions.

They were promised the world and were delivered nothing. The Exec team failed to manage the lack of delivery on the project, staff left in droves, (the I.T. team were completely destroyed), some were pushed and used as scape goats - this is a particular specialty of the company. The Exec team have never taken ownership of this and continued to throw good money after bad. The system was supposed to streamline the onboarding process of clients and reduce the time taken for the initial call to assist in doubling the number of clients that they could help, but sadly all it really achieved was hundreds of workarounds where the system didn't behave as expected which was a huge pressure on the DA's using it, more impacted clients than I dare to think about that were given incorrect advice, and staff left completely de-moralised because they were not allowed to use their brains to advise clients anymore, but had to rely on tick box questions that completely removed the personal experience. The calls are now longer and no real benefits have materialised, but if you try to talk about it, you are hushed and seen as a trouble maker.\n\nManagement - Over the years StepChange have developed a 'face fit' ethos when it comes to progression/recruitment, this could probably explain why there are numerous managers in roles that they are neither skilled or qualified to carry out. This has led to some very poor decisions, bad management, and the slow decline of morale in general across many teams and departments. Team Leaders have been known to be the rocks of many departments in my time, carrying the managers in some areas, doing the hard work and them taking the credit.\n\nCVPP - in short Phil, this idea was nearly as bad as Pulse. It\u2019s basically a DMP, something you offer every single day to clients, but no....let\u2019s spend thousands on advertising, give it a snappy name (because clients want to remember that it was Covid19 that got them in this situation) cause numerous colleagues to go off sick with stress because the project was so rushed and high pressure, and for what?? Some Exec members dared to stick their heads above the parrowpit and tell you that they didn't think it was a good idea, you shot them down.... perhaps that was a bad move. Maybe you thought it could be your legacy, well it might be.... just not the positive one you'd hoped for.\n\nRedundancy & Consultation process - this was an absolute disaster, as soon as it was announced at least 70 colleagues handed in their notice, a further 60 the month after, likely due to the worry and lack of stability of their positions and the not knowing if they were going to have a job in 6 months even if they survived this round. The process was incredibly unfair, although it was allegedly competency based, this wasn't the case, Exec members spoke openly to managers about just getting rid of numbers to save money - who they wanted to keep, and who they wanted to go before the consultation process had even started. Due to the vast amount of people that handed in their notice unexpectedly, they decided to reduce the number of redundancies - sorry but Unite Union thought that their protest outside the Leeds office had made them rethink the numbers, but it wasn't, they were just too scared to lose the people that they needed to keep."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Helping clients", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Oct 2021", "job_title": "Advisor in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Speaking to clients is the best part of this job.

I worked there for 2.5 years and literally fought for my job most of the time as my manager had a personal issue with me. I changed managers and left on good terms for another role but definitely would not recommend working there for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. My line manager did no job coaching with me in my first 6 months in the business. I failed my probation due to not meeting targets even though no one had mentioned areas to improve on. My manager took personal leave the month I was due for my performance review. The other manager involved did not write up the reasons why and I was put on a performance plan. \r\n2. I began struggling with mental health when we moved to temp offices due to the noise levels. I asked for an occupational health referral in writing as which was declined (which I now know is against the law - Equality Act). I was also refused a change of hours request as I had not passed my probation, which directly contradicts my statutory rights under Flexible Working.\r\n3. Found a more suitable desk in a quiet place to minimise mental health problems. I was initially refused having the desk reserved as we were in a hot desking environment. I brought up the fact other staff have specialist desks for physical health conditions and offered to put my request in writing but this was declined. I was allowed to keep the desk. I managed to smash the performance plan and also started helping new staff with knowledge etc.\r\n4. I was off sick for a partial day and in another performance review meeting in Dec 2018 I had my 6mth probation extended up to a whole year. I brought up the fact I lacked support up to this point from my old manager. However he was the note taker and I only received copies of the notes in 2020 and he failed to record his own mosdooings in them. I went to the centre manager about this and she did not care, telling me I had my class based trainint & was aware what the targets were and it was my fault for not hitting them.\r\n5. Jan 2019 we move to new offices and my desk position is not honoured and instead I'm put in a walkway. I try my best to keep my head down and pass probation, muddling through as best I could.\r\n6. April 2019 I finally pass probation and was also successful in obtaining the unpaid role of a staff coach.\r\n7. May 2020 I begin exhibiting symptoms of mental health issues which I could not keep on top of and had a period of sickness.\r\n8. June 2020 I return to work and not selected to coach new staff - the criteria was that staff had to have positive coaching feedback from the last intake. I could not meet this criteria as I was off sick which is classed as indirect discrimination.\r\n9. In the June I also experienced unwanted contact from a colleague I was previously in a 9mth relationship with. It escalated to the point the police were involved. My manager refused to speak to this person as it was a \"domestic matter\" and the Dignity at Work Policy did not apply because of my sexual relationship with them. PC Densham rang my manager directly to stress the importance of dealing with the situation quickly. SC spoke to the person in question 4 days later.\r\n10. My GP requests a change of hours for me to manage my mental health better. This is partially honoured although not fully. A full written explanation was not required as per The Equality Act 2010.\r\n11. Sept 2019 I experience a full blown relapse in a serious mental health condition. My manager deploys a series of tactics to try to push my resignation. He used WhatsApp to text me at random and ask for an update call with no planning. Occupational Health get involved and tell SC not to have me come in for disciplinary meetings as I'm too vulnerable so they send me 20 written questions to fill in which feel unnecessary and aiming to catch me out. I got an indefinite sicknote which my manager initially refused but then hoped to use as an excuse to push for a capability meeting which would have ended my employment. I was asked on multiple occasions why I couldn't just take medication to solve the problem. They asked if there was anything they could do to help so I put in for reasonable adjustments - the desk and hours which they previously failed to fully honour. My manager refused to give me a straight answer on either regardless of how many times I asked.\r\n12. Jan 2020 I return to work. Although the manager knew I was arriving the desk was not sorted but another manager helped move it for me. The hours were not changed and my return to work was hostile, although I brought in my union to help me as it was very adversarial. My manager took pleasure in putting me on a stage 2 sickness disciplinary and I was also not allowed to apply for promotion or certification because of this on my record. I raised 2 grievances and deactivated my old Facebook account as I knew my card was marked like many others raising a grievance before me who got fired or had to resign.\r\n13. My manager kept having 1 on 1 meetings with me even though he was directly named on the grievance and the meetings were getting confrontational. I reported this to the floor manager that was handling my grievance. My team combined with another that had a more experienced female manager. She was fair but during every contact drew up a record of conversation. I used this as a way to document both positives and negatives in the coming weeks and actually came in helpful although suspected it was a way for SC to make me feel uncomfortable.\r\n14. Feb 2020 - had my grievances heard. The one relating to reasonable adjustments was difficult as I was told SC could \"decide whether my request was reasonable or not\" and almost ended up in court but they caved when I told them the union sent me a legal pack. The grievance relating to the disciplinary on my staff file I was not prepared for. The debt advice manager from Leeds came up and basically tried to knock me down several pegs. I forwarded the meeting notes to my Remploy adviser who said the way I was spoken to was a safeguarding issue and they would have ended the meeting.\r\n15. Had multiple problems with one manager who kept finding fault with me over small things. He also refused to confirm information regarding pay for the new staff benefit restructure even though it was part of my paperwork, delaying the consultation process. \r\n\r\nLuckily I got to work from home due to COVID-19 and my new manager was much nicer. All of the stressors from certain managers disappeared as all contact was now recorded. As soon as I left the bad manager's team I was rated Outperforming most months and I even tried to help the other staff. I found gaps in the training and wrote materials in my own time about mental wellbeing, resilience etc. I set up a wellbeing library and the benefits of using Remploy.\r\n\r\nIn my final week I requested an exit meeting with HR which was fine at first and I almost felt bad for recording her. However part way through she starts laughing at some of the points I made, and I know this particular member of HR was involved in the decision to give me a stage 2 disciplinary."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "A lot of benefits but stressful", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Debt Advisor in Chester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice amount of holidays\r\nSick pay\r\nMaternity pay", "cons": "Lots of targets \r\nEmotionally draining"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good team of people, amazing charity", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Data Verifyer, Plan Activations in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good team, amazing team leaders, compassionate people", "cons": "None really, really enjoyed my time here"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Toxic Culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "5 Feb 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "This is an organisation that genuinely cares about its clients.

I'm pretty easy going anyway, but even so! \r\n\r\nThe job involves helping people in their hour of need...literally! You are doing one of the most valuable jobs in society. You get to talk to people from every walk of life, a window into other peoples lives. Very interesting work and you learn a lot!\r\n\r\nThe training is very good and the support put in place after training is exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe rewards package is competitive. \r\n\r\nLocation is handy and close to all sorts of amenities. \r\n\r\nWork life balance is very good. You leave the work at the door on the way out. Dont underestimate the value of that!

In this previous life, I was given far more respect and trust from my seniors. This was a transition for me at StepChange and I can say that after several years in the job, I still didnt feel I was trusted or respected necessarily, maybe I was, I just never felt that way. This is a large part of job satisfaction and it's an area for development with StepChange. You are micromanaged and have no autonomy. \r\n\r\nA good deal of managers and team leaders know nothing other than StepChange and that's a shame. It's not their faults, they have been recruited into these roles and good on them! However, if managers have a diversified pool of work experience, they are better. They bring these different ideas and approaches to the company. Sort of...How do you know if next doors grass is greener, if you have never looked over the fence?! So unless StepChange begin to recruit outside talent into middle manager roles, or inside talent with previous work experience, it will stay as it is. I always got the impression that middle management didnt have the confidence to question or challenge those senior to them. But I think the young TLs are very keen to climb the ladder and attain a title and just lack the life experience...I get it. I've worked for some amazing time served managers in the past. They manage people and know how to get the best out of their team. Stepchange manage targets and numbers and weigh the pig. But you have to feed the pig for it to get fatter. You have to invest in your staff and the results will come. This leads to the next point...\r\n\r\nYou get more with sugar than you do with salt. Because of the relentless focus on targets, positive feedback is an add on. It's not integral to the charity. This isnt for a lack of trying, I do feel like the TLs do try to recognise people positively, but its things like monthly certificates, vouchers, shout outs which are gimmicky. The charity system of monitoring is, on balance, focussed on the negatives. Positive praise is just not readily given at Stepchange. If your numbers and targets say you didnt do a good job, you didnt do a good job, despite working so hard and dealing with incredibly difficult situations. Weeks like this can be hugely disappointing and really affect your outlook on the job. This is where the effective people managers would be useful! \r\n\r\nThe pay is not reflective if the skill level and demanding nature of the job. This is an issue senior management need to address. They hugely underestimate the job and rely on independent companies drawing comparisons and making pay recommendations. Stepchange will not recruit or retain the calibre of talent the job requires by paying peanuts, and therefore will be on a merry-go-round of people leaving-people joining. All this at a huge cost to the charity's training operations. It could be amazing, but it's like a bus station of transient workers. You get what you pay for. \r\n\r\nIt's not an easy place to progress. Theres no built in pay scale progression, although this is under review.

StepChange used to provide a quality service at an individual level to clients. You called and spoke to someone who cared about you and your situation, you received advice from a knowledgeable individual that was tailored to your circumstances. You received probably the best service in the U.K. for free, depending upon that advice you would then choose a solution which may be administered by StepChange and if it was, you received probably the best aftercare in the U.K. throughout the administration of that solution.\r\n\r\nThen things changed, gradually and for the worse. Initially it was replacing the system with one that introduced \u2018decision logic\u2019 - this took away some of the requirement for knowledge, gradually training followed suit and people became less skilled.\r\n\r\nThen because of this and possibly as a precursor to an even newer system (transformation) the decision was made to \u2018merge\u2019 Helpline and Counselling resulting in many redundancies and a further reliance on \u2018decision logic\u2019 to provide solutions. Gradually this spread to the aftercare departments and the service you receive now is disgracefully woeful. It\u2019s fair to say that if you contact StepChange now in the first instance, regardless of your circumstances, you will receive no advice, relief or anything worthwhile until you have been forced through a scripted scenario to go through all of your circumstances so the computer can tell you what to do. This also is now prevalent through aftercare too.\r\n\r\nThroughout these changes, staff have been consistently lied to, year after year received token pay increases significantly lower than inflation and are subject to management (and grading) that is utterly subjective. No two members of staff are treated consistently - one person is ill and ends up on disciplinary, another is ill and is allowed to instead work from home therefore not being sick and avoiding any action related to that.\r\n\r\nDepartmental management is disgraceful. On the whole, clueless with no ability and a very definite ability to \u2018fall up\u2019 from any situation. In general having underlings do the work they then take credit for. I have experienced management that blatantly lies regarding many aspects of work and is called out on it - with no effect whatsoever, just a continuation of what they are doing.\r\n\r\nI have personally suffered several occasions whereby a manager has disclosed personal information about me to others when they shouldn\u2019t have, at one point this happened regularly over several weeks. I followed the correct procedure and raised a grievance with my manager, to be told they would take no action as they had spoken to them and they said the incidents didn\u2019t occur. This despite having several witness statements confirming what had happened.\r\n\r\nI have worked in both operational and non operational areas and certainly when working non operationally have been expected to work additional hours without pay, or reimbursement of hours. I Have been expected to carry out duties outside of my contract, including where these contravene Health and Safety law and have been publicly humiliated as a result of not carrying out these duties.\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t even comment on transformation except to say that much larger organisations have spent much less for bigger projects and delivered in a much shorter space of time (or even just actually delivered ...) \u00a315 million on an online form is not a good investment just on its own, never mind adding redundancies and real terms pay cuts for existing staff for years to fund it.\r\n\r\nBelieve me (and the other reviews) - StepChange is not a good place to work."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Horrific place to work", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Dec 2016", "job_title": "Debt Advisor in Halifax, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a job.  \r\nFree tea / coffee.", "cons": "Lying management / team leaders.  See the 'good reviews'?  Thats the TL's having found out about all the reviews on this site.\r\n\r\nTraining will give you the bare-bones.  Straight from training you will be expected to hit all stats.  The job is meant to be about helping clients, giving them tailor made debt advice.  It is not.  You are not allowed to think independently, you have to give them advice as per the computer (yes, it is very little britain).  As the systems cannot take individuality in to account, this frequently means clients end up being told about unsuitable solutions.  You will soon find that the Charity does not even understand the  FCA guidelines.  Team Leaders personal opinion forms a frequent part of call feedback, which is wrong; especially when they don't have a clue what they are talking about.\r\n\r\nThe systems are out of the arc, break on almost a daily basis, and nothing is done about them.  In the years i have worked there, they go on about investing in our people / systems, they don't.   Essentially, it is a case of put up and shut up.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is deplorable.  Many people are off sick due to work related stress.  Staff have been openly seen crying at their desks as they are unable to cope.  The team leaders do not have a clue what the job entails, and they certainly do not have any debt advice.\r\n\r\nThe center managers are liars and bullies.  One makes up 'rules' as he goes along, implements changes that have not been run past senior management or officially implemented.  This has a massive affect on staff, and it is the staff that end up paying the price.  No wonder morale is so very low.  One center manager frequently shares confidential management information with staff on the floor whilst he is outside smoking.  \r\n\r\nHuman Resources are useless.  Indeed, some people that had been dismissed have been to Unions and got their jobs back; says a lot don't you think?  this was also due to the outdated systems that could not provide basic information.  A decision was made to  sack a large group of people based on insufficient evidence, needless to say they are all back at work now.\r\n\r\nHealth & Safety / Fire Safety are seriously lacking.  Insufficient fire marshalls with records being made up as no-one is allowed time of the phone to complete their duties in that regard.\r\n\r\nIt is such a shame that the staff are thought so little of, as it is only the staff that care and want to do their best for the clients."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Worked in Plan Activations.

I\u2019ve now reached five years.\r\n\r\nStepchange are a company masquerading as a not-for-profit for people in problem debt. As a debt advisor you\u2019re really just a fancy debt collector for Stepchange. In turn Stepchange are a debt collector for the banks and creditors. This is reflected in the way repayment options are prioritised over insolvency options despite the latter often (usually) being better for the client. Why? Because Stepchange are funded by so-called \u2018voluntary\u2019 contributions from the credit industry. In English, this means that the banks and creditors give Stepchange back some of the money they receive through Debt Management Plans. This is a huge vested interest, a bit like McDonalds funding heart disease and cancer studies for diabetes charities and such like. \r\n\r\nThe training is designed to facilitate this. Changes in policy, procedure and system process take away autonomy and decision-making. You\u2019re turned into a human mouthpiece for what \u2018the system\u2019 decides. What the system decides is rarely in the interests of the client. It also makes employees on the frontline (debt advisors) expendable and replaced with absolute ease. Stepchange know this and treat staff with contempt. They set up in towns and cities where there aren\u2019t any better call centre jobs. They role out near-annual employee engagement surveys. They try to skew the outcome (announcing a sudden pay rise days before the survey is released, for example). But the results are always the same. The key area that is highlighted every year (aside from the shocking remuneration package) is communication. This never improves and the management conduct themselves as if they\u2019re working for MI5 and can\u2019t divulge anything. On pay rises: there\u2019s been one in line with inflation in all the years I\u2019ve been here.\r\n\r\nAs a debt advisor, the job is reduced to this: input the client\u2019s financial information onto a debt solution \u2018price comparison style\u2019 system, assess if they can repay their debts, then tell them about the solution that the computer thinks they should do. It\u2019s almost always about making sure the big banks get their money back. Or trying to buy the client time and suspend their payments while they work to get themselves to a position where they can pay it back. Stepchange sees 10 years as a reasonable time to repay debts. That\u2019s based purely on opinion. Even with Bankruptcy, you\u2019re debt free in a year and it\u2019s off your file after six. The training is all geared up to get the employee to improve their persuasion skills and get clients onto repayment plans. You\u2019re taught 'active listening\u2019 and told it\u2019s to improve your empathy. You\u2019re told to build rapport. You\u2019re told and taught a variety of techniques that they say make your call about the client. What\u2019s really happening is you\u2019re being coached in how to use techniques like mirroring and labelling which are more appropriate for a hostage negotiation than are for people in debt who have their backs to the wall and are, understandably, terrified.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also a perfect place for absolute career nihilism. Stepchange Debt Charity makes all the classic mistakes that lead to poor employee engagement and low overall job satisfaction. The charity is rotten to its core and in need of drastic change.  This overhaul is beyond the management capabilities of the current leaders. In my time at the company I\u2019ve witnessed countless examples of colleagues who feel utterly anonymous and unrecognised. I\u2019ve been there myself, feeling invisible and as if my potential and abilities are unwanted. You cannot grow as an individual or an employee. There\u2019s no interest from above in any hopes and ambitions you might have. Worse still, the job often feels irrelevant. The charity is managed in such a way that you don\u2019t even feel like a tiny nail in a board in the beams holding it all together. What should feel like a rewarding job where you help people to overcome financial strife ends up being a daily grind of fulfilling the charity\u2019s vested interests.\r\n\r\nThe default position on sickness is one of fault with the employee. You\u2019re made to feel as if you\u2019re lying, as if you couldn\u2019t possibly be sick, or injured, or mentally ill. Other reviews have gone into great detail about this but suffice to say - It\u2019s all true. The sickness policy is beyond terrible.\r\n\r\nAll the high-profile campaigning Stepchange do (led by CEO Phil Andrew) is just designed to make it easier to flog debt management plans to clients. Thing like breathing space, for example. Let me assure you, nothing is about the client.\r\nYou might enjoy working here if you enjoyed being at school. You\u2019ll be micro-managed and regimented. You\u2019ll learn something new for six months or so. I can only speak for debt advice (there\u2019s other departments, of course) but it\u2019s a dull, boring and repetitive job. Again, it might suit someone who\u2019s happy to plod and who doesn\u2019t mind being patronised. Someone who doesn\u2019t want to better themselves. Otherwise, look elsewhere. You don\u2019t want to get stuck here!\r\n\r\nAnd to the people who write reviews of their time at \u2018charity\u2019. Good on you - keep exposing it as the atrocious place to work that it is!

This is behaviour done by individuals in the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) or the Executive Team (ET). People at the Charity are treated abhorrently, mainly by the SLT and ET. You only get anywhere if your face fits and you smile, nod and say yes. Challenge anyone on what is being done, or what is being proposed and your card is marked and you are out the door. Post a review on Glassdoor and it is seen as just a moan, or someone having a bad day, as opposed to the truth. The reviews on Glassdoor are correct. It is a toxic place to work, with a horrendous culture. Debt advisors are overworked, trying to meet difficult targets which just seem to get more stringent. \r\n \r\nCulture; there is no culture at StepChange. There is no spirit, or sense of Team. Individuals are not valued, appreciated or even thanked. There is a clique among the higher ranks, and Team Leaders do as they please. People are just repeatedly bullied, harassed and spoken to in a disgusting manner. If, a normal person, not in a management or leadership role, challenges behaviour, they are sacked instantly. There maybe a dignity at work policy, and a code of conduct, but no one actually follows that, and no one certainly leads by example. People who suffer with mental health issues are basically signing their own termination, as the sickness policy is a joke, with new proposals soon to be launched, reducing the current offering, to be in line with other organisations. This is the first place I have worked, where the sickness policy isn't geared up for anyone who actually has an illness, or longer term health condition. \r\nThere is a blame culture, where those who are actually doing the do, are blamed, and used as a scapegoat. This is repeated over and over, and even communicated out, but then again, who wants to hear the truth right?  There is no support for employees, there is no honesty, and everything that is said is a lie. StepChange is not an organisation you should trust, and if you have any principles, then avoid, because you end up with none.\r\n \r\nLet\u2019s now focus on Transformation. The Charity has been undergoing a period of change. A lot of the Glassdoor reviews mention this change, and the newly implemented system. Well, this system is meant to be the be all and end all of the whole old systems, and is meant to do everything quicker, faster, with more ease. Again, more lies. The new system is poor. It takes longer to load, to complete the debt advice process, and no one enjoys using it. It is a nightmare to use when you have a client on the phone, and handling time is doubled if not more. Even the journey for clients who go online is horrendous, so much so, the online journey has been paused. Delivery dates were pushed out and out and out, but no one took any accountability. No one took responsibility. No one ever does. Money is thrown away on this new magical \u2018can do everything\u2019 system that clearly is not fit for purpose as it doesn\u2019t work, and causes more issues than all of the old systems put together. Yet the new system is still pushed and pushed. Anyone would have thought StepChange had millions in its reserves, but who remembers that it is a Charity? Because it certainly doesn\u2019t behave like one.  People lower down the ranks are blamed, used as a scapegoat and shamed into trying to work harder, faster, and are told to cut corners, to \u2018just do it\u2019, even if it is the wrong decision. The new system has so many work around, I'm surprised my colleagues can remember them all. But not one person in the SLT or Exec take responsibility, or accountability for the non-delivery of Projects. Despite some Projects and Programmes being owned by individuals in the Executive function for some months, or even years prior.\r\n \r\nThe Senior Leadership Team, and Executive Team, do not have any of the skills to lead and transform this organisation into a great place to work. In fact, none of the Senior Leadership Team actual lead anyone, instead it is a culture whereby people are managed out of the organisation due to fear. If you do this, or you don\u2019t do this then you are sacked. Good people join the organisation and quickly leave as they are treated so poorly. StepChange does as it pleases. They rail road over people who are trying to do their job, and do it to the best of their ability. Decisions are made without any understanding or knowledge, and without consulting any of the Teams who have to deliver. \r\n \r\nIf you want to aim high, and really earn your bonus (which is a pittance), then go for it. But know your scores are already decided by the Executive and Senior Leadership Team before you even have your end of year review. Even before the scores are calibrated, so makes a mockery of the whole end of year performance process. Why bother arguing why you deserve this that and the other, when someone who doesn\u2019t even know you, argues how good or bad you are?\r\n \r\nOverall, working for StepChange is soul destroying. Not only is it that, it is career suicide.

They want bums on seats but need to think about to keep the genuine staff who do care about clients to stay!! But they aren\u2019t bothered they will just run another training academy but they will also end up dropping like flies too.  The training was fun and enjoyable but the hard reality hits a few months in and then boom!! \r\nI have noticed on my old floor TLs and coaches regularly discuss feedback of staff infront of other staff which I find really upsetting for the colleague getting the negative feedback in that manner, so unprofessional. \r\nThe whole ethos of how step change needs to change completely, it needs to go back to being an actual charity and not to be run like a bank or business!!! The high management getting paid a lot of money to run this so called charity but are losing sight of why step change was set up in the first place. \r\nI have noticed since my time here how the company delivers feedback slowly just eats away at you, even people with thick skin in this place with struggle after abit. I feel like our option does not matter or count!!! They never side with the advisors and always side with the clients. Even if your quality is good and you go above and beyond a client which I did they will still find something wrong.  I am all for constructive feedback however how some TLs do this isn\u2019t in the correct manner and I have witnessed TLs making digs at other staff members around me about their performance. One person I have witnessed before I left was crumbling before my eyes, it\u2019s like step change was taking their every last bit of dignity left. Awful to see. \r\nNo pay rise for past 3 years now either. \r\nThe new system pulse which we spend gods knows what on keeps crashing or having faults when it\u2019s meant to be this wonderful revolutionary system!! It was delayed some many times we all lost count. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think management or TLs really grasp the impact of talking to very vulnerable people on their advisors well being or mental health. Its a very tough job mentally and you do need to be able forgot about it when you leave work but with the pressure of stats and constantly wanting more from us - this is something that can be very difficult. \r\nTo finish off, my advice to anyone looking to work here don\u2019t do it, not even if it\u2019s a stop gap. It\u2019s not an easy job and the morale in the place will drag you down to hell.

If you're lucky you might get a chocolate bar from the magic cupboard so you've got something to eat while you're crying but that's it. This might seem like a joke when it isn't.\r\nDept Advisors should be given gold plated, diamond encrusted gowns and placed on 100ft high pedestals for the work they do, really they should, but at best they're overlooked, at worst bullied and belittled, and be in no doubt about the fact that this will continue as it has for many many years.\r\nYes most call centre managers are focused on stats, but some of them are also focused on people; you have to thank people for the work they do every single day they do it, don't just ask the team leaders to do it and don't just send out a silly communication or launch a 'thank you' event that you read about in a people management text book 20 years ago. StepChange doesn't understand this at all. \r\nIt's almost incomprehensible to think that praise is rarely given to people in this kind of job, but even when praise is given it's because by some random alignment of the stars your stats happen to be good this month, every last one of those stats, people don't genuinely believe it carries any meaning or that you're truly being thanked. It's a lifeless kind of praise that's given to you privately in a drab side-room at the far end of the floor. It can't be public praise because there's no time for esteem building amongst the team, certainly not around some hollow percentage score you've managed to hit. There is no time for public anything, team building is mentioned occasionally in passing or as a joke, but it doesn't exist because everyone must be kept on the phones at all times. The only time you get to speak with some people in your team is when you're shuffling awkwardly round the kitchen, desperately trying to make a cup of tea and find your soul. The call centre is deliberately understaffed and this is a hill that the charity is willing to die on.\r\n\r\n'Clients are more important than anything else' is an interesting concept.\r\n\r\nIf you're 'lucky' enough to move into one of the back office roles like I was you'll find out how horribly cliquey the place is too, you can barely log into your computer without a bunch \"morally pure\" entities rolling their eyes at you. You'll also meet the people who've been 'managing' you for the first time and they are honestly some of the most awful managers you'll meet in your entire life. Demanding, inflexible and inhuman are some of the kindest words I can think of to describe the most, shall we say, well-known managers but let's not beat around the bush here, that small clique of managers are bullies, literally everyone knows who they are and they absolutely should not be in the positions they're in. The worst part is when you slowly realise that they have no introspection.\r\nEverything that is wrong with the culture at StepChange is on them and rightly so.\r\nThe HR department are beyond hopeless, I practically begged them for help with homophobic bullying and harassment that I experienced in a back office role and they would not intervene, so there is no chance that they're going to be able to stand up to a bullying clique of managers.\r\nWorking here is soul-destroying and it would have ruined me if I hadn't left."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Team Leader in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent to work for - person centred approach towards staff .\r\nLike everywhere you reap what you sow . \r\nGreat benefits- you just need to use them - plenty to choose from \r\nWould recommend highly to anyone", "cons": "Can be difficult working across multiple sites especially in the winter! \r\nBuildings in need of some maintenance"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Horrible Culture", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Talking to clients\r\nFree tea and coffee", "cons": "Stepchange isn\u2019t a great place to work, it has a bad habit of rewarding badly behaved managers and team leaders by moving them around departments on secondments or projects which are never advertised, why give negative team leaders and managers the opportunity to work across the charity, is this fair allowing a problem team leader or manager with zero people skills all the opportunities?Team leaders and managers moan about being overworked, always in meetings and run around looking stressed. I have heard team leaders moan about their workloads and hours they have to do when sat at their desks just to get the job done.In the office it\u2019s all about targets and they wonder why mental health issues are rife and people are off sick. Mental health issues aren\u2019t supported your told to ring EAP and people struggle with no support. It\u2019s a little late bringing in mental health first aiders now what about all the people who have left because working for Stepchange made them ill. HR don\u2019t support people in grievances the standard outcome for bulling, discrimination  or mental health is grievance not upheld, I know of people who have tried but failed HR hasn\u2019t supported them so people don\u2019t bother anymore.Favouritism is rife it\u2019s a big face fits culture, if your liked by your manager or team leader you get lots of opportunities, once again the favourites will get team leader secondments or project opportunities and then sneakily made permanent without the job being advertised, this happens all the time people are so demotivated, the place is full of manager and team leader cliques who lack people skills.The systems are terrible to work with making it difficult to do your job, the training isn\u2019t that good and communication is really poor and Pulse is a joke. The job is getting harder and harder. The salary is poor for the work you do but helping clients is rewarding but distressing sometimes. One to ones are all about what you missed in quality and what mistakes you have made so not much praise going on."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Standard call centre", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "16 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Debt Advisor in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The salary, the people, the holiday allowance and the health cover.", "cons": "Boring role, with no progression, unless your face fits. Pay rises not based on excellent performance.  \r\n\r\nHorrific sickness policy. No flexibility, so people with long term illnesses, mental health issues, children or who are carers, don\u2019t get the support they need. \r\n\r\nHR polices are not written well and some team leaders don\u2019t follow them correctly. There is no duty of care policy, which is unusual. HR don\u2019t seem very experienced or know what they are doing.  It\u2019s quite common for an employee to challenge a decision or policy, by using a union rep. They usually win. \r\n\r\nDepartmental managers and above are the same core group of people, moving around, so change never happens.  This makes it very hard for team leaders who want to get a managers job. \r\n\r\nTeam leaders have too many projects, so there is no time to lead, manage, coach or develop their staff. They are very stressed, with some working 50 hour weeks. They should be paid more and a project team should be employed, to do the projects. The charity probably won\u2019t do this, due to cost. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite common for team leaders to spend 36 hours a month in meetings and receive 250 emails a day. Some team leaders are brilliant and some are appalling. There is no consistency. You can be on a team where you get regular feedback, praise, motivation and one to ones. You can be on a team where this doesn\u2019t happen. This is because some team leaders take on the role to get a higher paid job in IT or project management. This means they have no desire to manage people. Because they do a lot of project work for senior management and say yes to everything, they get away with poor people management. \r\n\r\n\r\nChanges are made, without asking the people doing the role, how this will impact the client and the job. This means they aren\u2019t aware of potential issues, so when the  change goes live, it causes a lot of issues. It\u2019s then left up to the employees to fix it. \r\n\r\nThe training focuses on advice but not policies. This means new employees aren\u2019t aware of the policies to follow and make a huge amount of mistakes. I\u2019ve never worked anywhere with as many mistakes as this. It creates stress for the people fixing them and sometimes client complaints. \r\n\r\nThe job relies too heavily on systems and scripts. This means inexperienced people, don\u2019t really know what is best advice for a client or give detailed advice. It\u2019s not always a great client experience. They just read the script. When the system goes down, they can\u2019t do their job from memory. This is poor. \r\n\r\nThe salary and benefits are excellent. The pay rises and maternity/paternity pay, are horrendous. Also the lack of reduced hours, means it\u2019s hard to work here if you want to study, are a carer or have children. Some people do manage to get reduced hours but only by fighting it or getting a union rep in. Some people are too tired to fight, so just give in and accept the no. \r\n\r\nThe call centre relies too heavily on stats and not the client experience. Everything is a box ticking exercise, to look good to senior management, because they\u2019re scared of them. \r\n\r\nThe way they deal with complaints and FCA regulation is perfect. They always follow the law and do everything by the book. The issue is there\u2019s so much focus on clients, the employees become an afterthought. You\u2019re just a bum on seat and a number. \r\n\r\nOverall some people genuinely care and will do anything to help you/clients. Unfortunately this is now a low percentage. The majority of people are just there for the money or because they\u2019re too scared to leave. Some are there because they know they can get a high paid IT or project management job, without having the qualifications. \r\n\r\nThe lack of care really shows every day. It\u2019s reflected in a high sickness level, the horrendous staff turnover, low morale and feedback not being acted on. Most people are too stressed or tired to care. Some are just trying to leave and some just tick boxes to get ahead. This leaves the people who do care, de motivated and stressed, until they leave. It\u2019s all very sad. I really did care, every day. \r\n\r\nThis call centre could be an amazing place to work.

I should point out here that 'Heads of' and 'Directors' receive large bonuses, excellent pensions and private healthcare. \n4. Many clients are NOT genuine, I don't blame the clients as there just looking to save money by not paying their creditors in full. SC know, accept and even encourage this, as it suits them. It's all a bit murky ethically in my opinion. \n5. Biased internal policies. For example, it's deemed acceptable by SC for a client to pay their debts on a DMP for 10 years or more, as this brings funding in, however, this is rarely in the clients best interest. Integrity is questionable, clearly there is massive pressure from funders here! \n6. Merry-go-round turnover and no external endorsement of training. Everyone is replaceable on the front line. Debt advisors give advice but have no qualification to back this up, internal training team do their best but their own credentials and qualifications are questionable.
