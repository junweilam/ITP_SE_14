So, my starting statement is: What a company! I've worked in many jobs over the years for many different companies, so I have a lot of places I can compare a place to. I usually leave a company quite coldly, People aren't usually bothered about if I leave and the feeling is usually mutual - because I've been there as a means to an end, to earn money, to pay my bills, etc...\r\n\r\nBUT, here? I have to say, I'm really sad to have to leave.  The people make this company a pleasure to work for and the work ethic is very mature. You are trusted to get on with your work and the management, although active on checking your progress and your results, aren't breathing down your neck all the time, cracking the whip for you to 'hurry up with your work'. But because it's a pleasure to work at the place, you kind of just want to do your best in your job anyway. At least that's how I've felt since day one.. The staff are very supportive and friendly and they just give a damn about people in general. They all take pride in what they do and the atmosphere is generally very chirpy and bright. Work facilities are always kept clean and tidy as well and health and safety is always maintained in the buildings by that department, in particular, the manager - I won't name him but what a nice guy!\r\n\r\nTop marks from me. I hope I can come back to work here some day.", "cons": "The only negative I can give the company is their application selection and interviewing processes for their jobs. I had 3 interviews for 4 jobs in 4 different departments (including a permanent position for my own job) while I was a contractor, and I didn't get any of them! And the job application I wasn't given an interview for was immediately rejected because I hadn't expanded on the positives I spoke about myself on - but I thought that's what interviews were for?! Obviously I'm not going to like the fact that I didn't get any of them but my own job?! I've been trained and proven my worth and none of this was automactically taken into consideration. The interviews were held like I was a new person to the company. Essentially someone off the street. The interviews also weren't social enough, they were kind of robotic - Asking questions and you were expected to answer with the answers THEY required and in the way THEY wanted it to be answered and at the right time. I felt like they hadn't considered the things I had spoken about and showed them to demonstrate my suitability to the roles - and for my job role in particular. I'd provided them with print outs of my compliance with deadline times and also print outs of positive feedback I'd received from clients/customers I'd resolved issues for and this still didn't seem to be enough. I was gutted. And even after the interview process for all candidates, they offered the job to someone, he got another job offer and took that one instead and now they have no one because they refuse to choose one of the other candidates because they didn't tot up enough points in their interviews. I know it could be seen as choosing the best of a bad bunch if you choose the next one down but surely there more to an interview process than just"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great Colleagues, Poor Culture", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "19 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Process Analyst in Shrewsbury, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Real skill and commitment from colleagues, excellent department managers and team leaders, great social purpose, huge amount of potential, good annual leave.", "cons": "Poor executive-level management and a lack of 'doing' resourse, exacerbated by misplaced focus on merger growth rather than stabilising the existing operations.
