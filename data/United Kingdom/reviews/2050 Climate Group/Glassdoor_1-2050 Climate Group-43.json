It was really rewarding to feel like you were contributing to something bigger than yourself. It is run by young people for young people so I feel like there isn't that nasty bureaucracy you experience in some workplaces. It was a fresh and very exciting place to work. There was a lot of room to be heard and voice your concerns. I was allowed complete creativity as long as it aligned with the organisations mission and vision. The manager would continually check in and offer support and advice as needed. The staff and volunteers were extremely understanding and I felt like I was truly valued and respected. Best of all, I got to meet and work with an amazing, caring and super smart group of people that care about one other and the planet.", "cons": "While there was a healthy work life balance (4 day week), I felt as though I really had to cram a lot into each day in order to achieve what was needing done. Also, I get that it is a non-profit and funding is limited but I was disappointed to learn that adjustments couldn't be made to create a permanent post for my role. I felt as though my position was central to growing the charity's engagement and constituency which is much needed given the urgency of climate change. This is beyond their reach though and dependent upon their annual funding so it's understood. However, I'd happily return to Edinburgh and work with 2050 Climate Group if they are looking to grow again!
