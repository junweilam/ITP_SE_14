Definitely not a job for staff who care what they do - you are definitely replaceable and customer service team leaders use this to their advantage in a very negative bullying way! Customer service is the first port of call, staff are more like switch board - they go through security with caller and then have to transfer to customer s case worker. Bear in mind min wait times to speak to a customer services representative is 45 minutes - customer is annoyed then they have to be transferred. Training is a joke, less than 2 weeks training, covering very little and given no time to process what has been told - in one ear out the other due to information being read from a power point to you. Orbit Group has a focus of housing for customers yet fails miserably in supporting them. It\u2019s not right that an angry/ upset customer has to wait at 45 minutes to speak to someone and gets verbally aggressive as they are at breaking point to report and wait further for help. 6 months probation and not allowed to move departments until probation passed.
