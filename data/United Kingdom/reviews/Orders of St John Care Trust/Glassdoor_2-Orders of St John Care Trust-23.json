I am now a residential manager and reflecting back on this employment with horror knowing what I know now and how standards should be makes it even worse. I worked at a home in Stonehouse. Home very outdated and smelt vey strong of urine the minute you walk in, not pleasant for the residents. Interviewers didn't seem interested in me at all, basic questions, seemed in a hurry to get the interview over with. Got the job and first day no training, sat me infront of a computer in isolation for 2 days reading really unhelpful material. Shadowed a member of staff for a few hours then thrown in the deep end to get on with it as short staffed and a busy workload. Genuinely had no idea what I was doing and when I spoke up several times there was no support. Extremely ganged up staff, a big group that didn't like outsiders and would bully myself and 2 other new staff and look at you like dirt. Total lack of respect. Poor moving and handling practises, a box of slings lucky dip no moving and handling plans the staff would use slings far too big for the small resident and vice versa. 3 staff to a floor or 22 residents was a normal shift, totally unsafe and not person centered at all. Never seen management on the floor they hid in the office with a closed door policy. Had extreme anxiety going to work everyday and only lasted 3 months before getting a fantastic job at my current employer of six years. I only hope things have improved now 6 years on, and wish I spoken up about my concerns at the time but being my first job in care I thought it was normal. Low pay. No support. No review meetings or return to works. Nothing at all. Genuinely still traumatised from this experience. Residents that should have been 2 staff for personal care were classed as a 1, it was unsafe and unfair on the residents. I heard a few months after terrible accident happened and there was a big investigation into the home. During my time I realised the only career development would be if your face fit and you knew the big wigs personally. A few of the staff were really lovely and welcoming and so caring and resident focused they felt the same as me but got on with it as they had previous experience I miss them to this day."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Love working at OSJCT", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Oct 2019", "job_title": "Operations in Witney, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great company to work for, Dan is an amazing CEO and really takes of OSJCT values to heart, they recruit amazing people,  all of the homes are fantastic to work with, really good work-life balance, I really recommend this employer.", "cons": "I can't think of any cons to working at OSJCT.
