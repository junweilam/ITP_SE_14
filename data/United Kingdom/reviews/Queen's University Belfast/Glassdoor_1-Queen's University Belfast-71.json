What are the commitments and strategies for marketing these programmes? How does the programme websites compare to its competitors? Is the University leveraging its location and its human resources effectively?\r\n\r\n*How stable is the academic team you will be joining?  Are your future colleagues satisfied with the direction the University is going?  How many are actively seeking work elsewhere?  Have many people left the programme recently? Why?\r\n\r\n*If you are at entry level: are the requirements (teaching, admin, research) to pass probation within a two year period reasonable?  How do they compare with competing institutions?  What has been the recent experience of academics on probation in your programme?  What tangible support mechanisms are in place to help you succeed (curricular development, teaching assistance, financial support for research material and travel, ring-fencing of research time)? \r\n\r\n*If you are an established researcher, with the aspiration to win external research grants: how does the University handle the income you will generate?  Talk to current grant holders about their experience.  Ask them about support for managing the paperwork and the people. Ask them whether they have actually got the relief from teaching and admin specified in the grant they have won.
