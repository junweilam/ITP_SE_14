Very nice, modern office with good equipment and facilities.", "cons": "Very poor management, and a very top-heavy organisation. The antiquated phrase of \"too many chiefs and not enough Indians\" comes to mind. There are a number of managers who lack experience but have been promoted due to nepotism, their relationship to senior staff, or due to their Catholic faith. For a so-called secular charity with Catholic origins, it is notable how openly Catholic staff are treated and elevated. \n\nOne very poor manager hired a staff member who could not do basic word-processing (rather than copy and paste from a Word Doc to an email, she was typing everything word for work - didn't know how to copy and paste!). Other staff had to carry her and do much of her work for her. Yet, she somehow passed probation, and had a full-time permanent contract on almost \u00a330,000 per year!! How was this allowed to happen?\n\nThere is a sense of \"us and them\" between MMI and MMUK, who share the office, and this leads to lack of communication and important things falling through the gaps. \n\nOpportunities to develop and progress are few, and very experienced and eager staff and not given opportunity to use their skills effectively, due to the excess of managers. \n\nThe Board is (or at least was, during my time) comprised entirely of Western white business people. There was no representation from Africa or Asia where the work was being carried out. To me, this is a major red flag due to high risk of \"white saviour syndrome\" where interfering westerners seek to do good but inadvertently cause harm. There needs to be qualified professionals from the countries Mary's Meals works in, advising and guiding the strategy. \n\nThe food served varies hugely between countries. Some countries like India or Haiti have a variety of meals served through the week, with rice, vegetables and fish or meat. In Malawi, where the vast majority of meals are served, it is a thin watery porridge which lacks nutritional value. They are so eager to \"reach the next child\" and increase the numbers of children fed, that they don't pay attention to WHAT is being fed, and whether it is good enough. For context, when I started working here, they reached the 1 million children milestone. Now, about 5 years later, they have just announced 2 million children fed - but the quality of food has not improved."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Divine providence?

There\u2019s a bit of a strange cult atmosphere, with the bizarre prevelence of religious fundamentalists across teams, and this becomes apparent in the first few weeks as an employee. An example being all staff meetings where leaders ask staff to join them in a catholic prayer and new starts are left mortified or overjoyed. Staff quickly learn about their colleagues\u2019 personal faith due to this incredibly visible forum, which is not very inclusive or professional\r\n- The PDR process that they recently rolled out is the worst I have ever experienced in my career. Unattainable levels to get a pay rise, completely subjective rating, SLT feed into individual grades despite not knowing what individuals are working on (or even who they are!) and there\u2019s a lack of clarity and feedback on grading. This leaves colleagues disgruntled and many leave as a result \r\n- People are scared to give feedback over fears of coming across as \u2018negative\u2019 or against the goals of MM, when it\u2019s usually the people who care the most that want to offer up positive changes and are shot down.\r\n- Lots of talented, intelligent and incredibly hardworking staff at officer and middle manager level who do the majority of work while unnecessary heads of and directors (in their droves) sit in meetings all day. Ask yourselves MM, do you really need a head of every single tiny department (some not even managing anyone)? What are they doing all day apart from sitting in meetings? Is this good stewardship of resources?\r\n- There\u2019s a huge amount of money wasted on international travel and training that could happen on Teams. It\u2019s always the same people going on trips and it\u2019s often booked or changed at the last minute and costs thousands of pounds for flights. Quite frankly, it appears that some senior staff are only there for the photo opportunity.\r\n-Nepotism is rife. Its run like a family business and those who are related to the founder are often promoted without the job being advertised. It\u2019s a running joke in the Glasgow office whenever an email comes round to advertise a role, that it has been created for one of the founder\u2019s relatives. Most of SLT and affiliates seem to be in jobs because they\u2019ve been in the right place at the right time or are friends with the CEO and family.\r\n-The culture seriously needs looked at. Office politics are unlike anywhere I\u2019ve ever worked, with infighting amongst teams and money getting lost because of constant battle between MMUK and MMI and their leadership to save their egos and impress the founder.\r\n- High levels of turnover and people \u2018getting disappeared\u2019 - where they\u2019re sacked or go on a period of absence before they never return again. There\u2019s a joke between staff that there\u2019s a trap door in one of the meeting rooms! One senior recruit lasted a record of only 3 days!\r\n- The final straw for many staff was the CEO\u2019s weekly emails throughout the covid 19 pandemic - which were (I think) designed to inspire employees but overall had quite the opposite result. He frequently described the charity\u2019s success in keeping afloat down to \u2018divine providence\u2019, in a manner that, as a non-catholic, I found truly insulting. The reality? Experienced professionals working long hours from their sofas and dining tables to do everything they could to ensure that those kids wouldn\u2019t go hungry, all while worrying about their own jobs and livelihoods."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Frustrating & disappointing experience, could have been great..", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in Glasgow, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some lovely people work here, although I don't feel they are often appreciated. \nSeeing video footage from affiliate countries of the feeding programmes in action was amazing.", "cons": "Where do I start..??\nLack of policies and procedures made my job extremely difficult to the point I felt I was almost being expected to swim with my arms tied behind my back. \nTerrible office politics which I didn't expect in a charity which is really pushed as being 'one big global family'.\nRepeatedly told not to share information with other teams, as backstabbing was taking place, this wasn't dealt with in a professional way.\nManagers not getting along filtered down and affected how we could do our jobs, again making things more difficult than they should be.\nSome members of the organisation are clearly in high positions due to donating lots of money, this leads to them treating admin staff like slaves when they get a chance.\nRidiculous amounts of money and resources spent on flying staff around the world for training which could often be carried out via Skype!
