The Management and specifically the current Head of Event seems to have no empathy or understanding of Mental Health support, especially during the global pandemic, probably due to her military background as army reservist. In addition they offer no help if new members of team are verbally mobbed by the Head Chef of Tate Eats, and also if you are overworked due to not sleeping the legal amount of hours to be on the job. \r\n\r\nWorth also mentioning, the food the staff get everyday (except for the Level 7th canteen) is disgusting, mostly fried or sauce filled meals, prepared in bad manner by the chefs, who are not instructed on possible different dietary requirements of the staff daily. The meals for the staff are moved across the buildings in a not very safe way, I would not be surprised if someone will get sick soon or later, especially considering the use the same wheelie carts for food AND to get rid of bags of garbage. \r\n\r\nIf you are new to Tate Galleries, you would think at least someone would be interested in Arts... unfortunately, they have no passion or commitment to contemporary or classic art, absolutely no knowledge even of the same art exhibition they schedule events related to. Very very shameful.\r\n\r\nThe Event Management fails to deliver a good work environment worth of the name of Tate Modern & Britain.

Management doesn\u2019t take time to get to know their staff and use their strengths towards the overall smooth running of the shops. Budget seems to be more important than the human factor which, to be fair, could be expected of a shop, however, gallery shop is not just any shop and there won\u2019t be a single Tate shop left if members of staff feel so uncomfortable that they quit one by one. Most of these people are well educated, creative individuals, with PhDs, Masters degrees and years of experience in retail and art world.

More interested in keeping up appearances rather than engaging with staff - hence her response here, it's all superficial. Distant is an understatement. For the business this woman isn't so much Wright as utterly wrong! The main office is over two floors and I personally saw her upstair where I worked twice in over a year.
