The salary OS offers is woefully low in comparison to similar roles. \r\n\r\n- Last year we were told we would not receive bonuses or an annual pay review and that some staff could expect to be made redundant.   Prior to these announcements  the company blew their budget on widescreen TVs that no one watches, a learning tool that no one uses,  a new case management system that doesn't work and randomly: a chandelier. This doesn't even begin to cover the ineptitude and lack of foresight that can be found at OS. \r\n\r\n- A sizeable portion of the management team appear to have joined a cult where they've been brainwashed into believing OS is a great place to work (I believe some of them have left positive reviews on this site,  it's the only explanation)  and  that they don't value quantity over quality when it comes to casework.  They parrot generic claptrap at anyone who raises an issue with the changes they're implementing and anyone who expresses concern is treated to wilful obtuseness  and/or is accused of not \"embracing change.\"\r\n\r\n- Shortly before I left,  they increased the targets and used the new CMS (which remember, doesn't actually work that well) as the justification for this when in actual fact it's because they need to generate more revenue to dig themselves out of the hole they've gotten themselves into. \r\n\r\n- The only positive aspect of working at OS was the flexi time, which allowed us to split our time between the office and working from home as we saw fit.  This was arbitrarily changed,  so that now anyone wanting to work in this way must gain prior approval (please sir, I want some more!!) and it was made very clear that these requests were to be made sparingly. When this was challenged,  we were told it was in an effort to get away from \"legacy thinking\" and we were receiving high missed calls on Fridays due to staff leaving early. This was barely a week after we'd been told that the majority of our contact from customers is online. \r\n\r\n- Another small saving grace was the option to have breakfast in the canteen of a morning, as they serve a decent fry up.  However, shortly before I left,  the canteen began serving breakfast on paper plates and small plastic cutlery, which made eating fairly awkward.  When we asked why this was happening,  the canteen staff told us that management had requested this,  in an effort to dissuade people from having breakfast.  Not only does this suck for the environment but this is such a petty and cynical move. If I hadn't already been leaving,  this would have pushed me over the edge.   \r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that OS is actively creating a hostile working environment, paying its staff a pittance,  disregarding the views of its staff and offering its staff no opportunities for growth/progression. I honestly am so disappointed with how far this place has fallen. We were promised all manner of things at interview and virtually  none have come to fruition.  I don't see the sense in upsetting your workforce on multiple occasions than requesting more work from them,  but if you do: you should apply to work here.

Well because it\u2019s not easy to jump to another role which offers \u00a324k +. \r\n\r\nI find it sad that years on, operations managers are still in denial and ignoring IO staff\u2019s pleas for help and support.\r\n\r\n Yes the business has to make money, but it\u2019s doing so at the expense of health and well-being of the staff. I\u2019ve witnessed bullying, micro managing and deliberate managing out of people rather than supporting them when they struggle with change. Note the review which says if you don\u2019t like change it\u2019s nit for you - how about you support the staff properly through change instead of bullying them out. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s truly is a negative, toxic, draining place to work as an IO and needs the whole process and management team replacing. I meet my target week in, week out and pass all QA checks but the target and relentless pressure is suffocating. \r\n\r\nAs for career opportunities, in Investigations, absolutely zero opportunities. Don\u2019t believe anything else. \r\n\r\nIf you didn\u2019t have mental health issues before working here, you most definitely will end up with them if you work here."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Not bad, not good.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "31 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Investigation Officer in Warrington, North West England, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Work from home\r\n- Unlimited overtime.\r\n- Generous holiday allowance (with the option to purchase more)\r\n- Technology purchase benefits (wage deduction)\r\n- Great managers \r\n- Great colleagues  \r\n- Clean offices", "cons": "- No bonuses/pay rises \r\n- No progression opportunities\r\n- Not paid for the job role you do, compared to a similar roles in other offices."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Investigation Officer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Investigation Officer in Daresbury, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great atmosphere and amazing manager.\r\nThe company always welcomes feedback for well being, and every time feedback given, the company analyses and implements quickly.
