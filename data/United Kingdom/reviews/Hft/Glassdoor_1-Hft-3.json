I am autistic and only just got my care certificate after working there for 1 year and 3 months, during that time period i completed my theory care certificate within 3 months however my practical side was not done until this year and this was because managers lack of willing to let me use my skill set and managers overreacting at the possibility of my autism interfeering with my job. also managers loosing my practical notes because i did a better job than other staff members\r\n\r\ni have been shunted around from several hubs, within this time scale and also had a manager who discriminated against me based on myself being autistic and giving me menial task to do despite having a Bachaors degree, however i can say that i have had a few good coleagues to work with whilst other constantly criticised how i was working when i was using initiative, skill and following support plans. i was told off for eating non halal food. i wastold i was nto doing enough personal care when i was doing more than enough. i even stepped up when a person we supported had a seizure and took charge of the hub when senior staff had to go to the hospital and other staff were out in the car. Despite showing this initiative and leadership managment gaslit me and falsified claims that i was asleep at work. when in fact i ws struggling to cope when the tempreture in the building ws hot and liek a greenhouse which for many people can cause drowsiness.\r\n\r\nin some parts i  had some support from one manager and hub leader however, 3 previous managers have failed to help me feel included in a team. i have been scratched, bitten, headbutted and grabbed where i have been left with physical brusises and marks upon my body, also managers told me off for being literal as i written up incident forms,\r\n\r\nThe salary that support get in bradford is abysmal and staff are underpaid for the type of work that we work in, also in our roles we have to do personal care( i.e changing soiled pads ect) and other jobs that are not given a full description. staff often have low morale due to poor management. hub leaders often can be condescending to staff and support plans are not followed through.\r\n\r\nservice users in some services are denied oppertunity to go swimming due to a number of staff not wanting to go swimming or are unable to do so for religious reason( when in interviews they stated that they will take people we support swimming. staff got  away with lying in their interviews.\r\n\r\nI should mention that radio 119 in rund by hft only get 15 mins a fortnight of air time, when in fact the service has the potential for weekly one hour shows and podcast. which mangers denied and also state it was down to BCB( the buildings owner to allocate air) when i asked bcb the stated that hft insisted on only 15 mins a fortnight this is supressing disabled peoples voiced and laos restricting to what they can be doing on a weekly and daily basis. on average the shows can be produced withing a week. i had the relevent degree and experience in radio production which hft failed and refused to utilise."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Okay but needs improvement", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "20 May 2020", "job_title": "Support Worker in Bristol, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Courses and some of the training are really good, Cares about the people they're supporting", "cons": "Too much online training that is repetitive and boring to complete, No bonuses, Needs staff team-working as their central target, Communication it's poor"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Some good people but heading off course", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Support Worker in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Depending on the home you could find some good colleagues and clients.", "cons": "Admin and management heavy, low pay and not focused on caring for their clients"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "People are great, company terrible", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Aug 2020", "job_title": "Support Worker in Worcester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are lovely, pws and staff", "cons": "Company are all about numbers and not about happy clients.
