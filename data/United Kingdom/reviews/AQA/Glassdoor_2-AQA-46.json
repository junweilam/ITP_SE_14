Suddenly no issue, manager sharply says do properly, leaves. \r\n3.\tWrong correction by official trainer \u2013 they apologised, issue not raised in recent training.\r\n\r\nGood relations management relations not encouraged \u2013 unapproachable, untrustworthy\r\n1.\tNegative service comments from customers \u2013 not acted on\r\n2.\tNegative comments when systems introduced \u2013 at times avoiding potentially life threatening/ unpleasant reactions, following training.  Told to stop, time wasting.\r\n3.\tAngry/sharp/aggressive management style - if not get desired responses, or when help sought.  Reasons not sought.  Experienced by many.\r\n4.\tConsistency sought by Managers \u2013 managers routinely inconsistent - opposing approaches.  Desired approach changes, staff not told in timely manner.\r\n5.\tIncorrect/negative information given by management - to staff concerning others, affecting departmental relations, corrected by team members.  No comment on improvements. \r\n6.\tUnknown issues - Staff considered failing for not providing solutions, these not sought once told, negative written comments.\r\n\r\nPoor Management \u2013 Higher management aware of issues.  No attempts to clarify.\r\n1.\tUnable to calculate increasing workload - reduced staff, at full stretch, told to cope. \r\n2.\tOutput more important than health \u2013 health issues causing time off/affecting work considered valid negative review issues.  Management concern - staff stressed, not reasons.\r\n3.\tIn-house medicals, flu jabs etc \u2013 managers don\u2019t tell you, attend in own time.\r\n4.\tApproved holidays not recorded - multiple overlaps, short staffing, stress.  Consultation avoided further clashes.  Staff falsely blamed for not following procedures.\r\n5.\tRarely recorded contributions \u2013 not pass on changes in contribution requirements in timely manner, contributions not recognised.\r\n6.\tCommunication poor/non-existent - targets, meetings, procedures etc.  Negative feedback, different systems, inability to prepare for meetings, stakeholders not told of changes.\r\n7.\tCommunication flexibility not required \u2013 If initial approach fails, other person blamed.\r\n8.\t\u2018Discussions\u2019/ Mentoring\u2019 one way - from manager.  Only very precise phrases acceptable.\r\n9.\tPoor Staffing/ work/ life balance \u2013 Staffing levels insufficient, temporary staff avoided.  Stressed staff told to cope. Overtime essential (pressured to) in quiet times.\r\n10.\tSolutions \u2013 Only management ways wanted, others discouraged, including previous good systems.  Ideas led to accusations of inability to cope, and blaming staff for failing.\r\n11.\tManagement felt unable to listen by staff due to confidence loss \u2013 therefore did not raise issues/give explanations, denied it was their problem. \r\n\r\nNew management lacking essential knowledge\r\n1.\tFailed to know staff - assumed abilities/learning styles - wasted time \u2018teaching\u2019 unnecessarily.  Staff (perm & Temp) leaving, with useful information. \r\n1.\tTried to hide mistakes - even when made aware.  Resolved by speaking to higher management.  Multiple mistakes.\r\n2.\tManagement told something possibly not know \u2013 regular, sharp responses.\r\n3.\tClaimed issues not raised with them when they had \u2013 they had dismissed issue.\r\n4.\tRemoved systems preventing issues - commented when re-occurred, solutions not sought.\r\n\r\nFavouritism\r\n1.\tStaff made official first aiders, receiving full external training before probationary interview.\r\n2.\tSome temporary staff retained once not needed, most go immediately. \r\n3.\tSome if they hate a task, removed from it.  Others must do as allocated.\r\n4.\t3 month probationary reviews \u2013 Most done after 4 months, favourites promptly, noted. \r\n5.\tManager away, very new staff put in charge of team, despite lacking knowledge.\r\n6.    Some staff offered chance to attend events, others not.  Some on weekdays, some weekends.  Others not even asked."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "A good place to learn your trade", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Jun 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Guildford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly people\r\nA good place to learn\r\nTraining\r\nLovely location/Great surroundings", "cons": "Not many percs\r\nLow salaries\r\nRigid pay structures\r\nLimited career progression unless you want to become a manager\r\n20 years behind in most areas"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good for a temporary summer job", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "29 May 2017", "job_title": "AQA Temp Staff in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The opportunity to have full time hours for short periods of work is really good if you are only looking to work for a short time.
