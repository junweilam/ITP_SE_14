job. \r\nJust overall a poor company to work for with incapable staff managing departments and very unorganised.  I've recently had to listen to my deputy head of the department slam the single parent learners saying \"They are worthless in educational and working environments and should have their legs taped shut\"  (I kid you not from someone that should be supporting learners and their staff). Family-friendly policies are none existent but advertised on their application site. Every month half the staff didn't get paid correctly if at all and getting hold of someone in HR to fix this is near on impossible. Very poor organisation skills and the college will fail with this as nobody knows what they are doing. Learners having a different tutor each week if they are lucky enough to have classes without them being canceled due to a lack of staff (several members of staff off due to high workloads causing them to burn out)."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Supportive staff", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Jul 2016", "job_title": "Lecturer in Horsforth, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In my final year at Leeds City College, in one of the smaller campuses, I found the staff support and friendliness far exceeded that within the larger campuses such as Park Lane which was unfriendly and unsupportive.", "cons": "The lack of respect from management to teachers was deplorable, no support, added pressures and no thanks at the end of the day, week, term or year.
