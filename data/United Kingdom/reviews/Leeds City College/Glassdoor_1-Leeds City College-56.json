The persistence of the ELT to continue to treat education solely as a business venture, obsessed with constant growth, is absurd. Leeds City College has the lowest paid staff, by far, of any comparable College within 50 miles. The ELT pay absolutely no attention to feedback, and anyone questioning their ludicrous plans to become \"world famous\" is labelled as a \"naysayer\" (these are actual quotes from a conference a few years ago). There is constant gaslighting of staff. For example, they will send out a questionnaire every year and then only feed back responses to questions that were very carefully worded to force answers that appear to be positive. Anything that seems negative towards the direction the college is taking, anything that might reflect the true nature of the situation in this place is conveniently left out... not important, I suppose. The college recently sent out an email about a new 'benefit' they had put in place for staff struggling due to the cost of living crisis... a loan. They have brought in a company to offer loans to staff who are struggling and the college will take payments out of our wages each month to pay it back. You would think paying their staff better would be a more effective solution, but the college has been emailing us to explain that it is actually the unions that are preventing them from implementing their insultingly low 'payrise'. I get that everyone is struggling at the moment, but let's get this straight... a teacher at Leeds City College, at the top of the pay scale, is on ~\u00a330k. Compare that to any other college in the area. It's appalling. Those in the higher positions of the college have had pretty comfortable pay rises this year. Apparently because they have taken on 'extra duties'... as though that's not something that has been forced on every member of staff, every year, for years, coupled with an effective year-by-year pay cut. All of this, it seems, is because the college prefers rapid expansion over quality service. They can't pay staff because they need more money for 'capital projects'. Good luck with those shiny new buildings when you can't find anyone to teach and support students in them. I'm absolutely done with this place."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Forget education - it's all about making money", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "26 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Lecturer in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues working together are lovely.
