Assistant Support Workers have the same caseload and case complexity as Support Workers in the team but get paid approx \u00a32,000 less a year which makes no sense. Little to no training was provided. My induction was reading printed out powerpoints with little context and I shadowed some colleagues on visits for 2 weeks before I was assigned my own cases and made to go it alone, despite being completely new to support work. \r\nIt's emotionally draining work and difficult to take leave because of being so overworked. Some of my colleagues would work on their days off and weekends to try to catch up. The targets set were unreachable and unmanageable workload meant that service provided to clients was subpar as there wasn't enough time to work with them properly. There isn't much satisfaction as you didn't have the capacity to make meaningful change in your clients' lives as you were spread so thin. I had a caseload of over 40 people, despite only being there 3 months. I felt like I was doing them all disservice and it was very frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe management was chaotic and provided little to no support for staff. We were often understaffed due to high staff turnover or people on long term leave for mental health reasons. I was assigned 3 high risk cases which I was wasn't trained or qualified to manage, because all senior lead workers were signed off sick. It was an incredibly stressful environment and I ended up resigning due to having a nervous breakdown. When I was on sick leave, management called me daily to see when I would be coming back. It was too much.\r\nThere was also a strange cliquey work culture which seemed to be based around faith and Christianity, which often led to uncomfortable conversations and questioning of others in the office."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Varied experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "30 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Social Services Lead Worker in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some of the most exceptional people staff wise, who want to make a real difference to the lives of others.", "cons": "Some of the worst people staff wise, who appear to go under the radar (management wise) and get away with atrocious behaviour."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great people and working environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2021", "job_title": "Community Support Worker in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Staff are really valued and there is a lot of support from everyone in the team", "cons": "The work can be challenging as in any job within the charity sector"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Brilliant employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "23 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Floater/Project Worker in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "They value staff and make you feel important and appreciated", "cons": "Management can be poor though"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Supportive", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The job provides social impact and responsibility which is very rewarding", "cons": "There are none apart from current Covid lock down measures"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "So so", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Administrative Support Worker in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Dedicated and well meaning staff", "cons": "Staff overstretched and funds limited"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": ".", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Business Development in Liverpool, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Thames Reach is a charity", "cons": "It works in the charitable sector"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Assistant support worker", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "13 Jun 2017", "job_title": "Support Worker in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Thames reach gave me opportunity for training and development , they teach me everything I know today and because of that training I have full time job in homeless sector .", "cons": "Interview process is really poor .
