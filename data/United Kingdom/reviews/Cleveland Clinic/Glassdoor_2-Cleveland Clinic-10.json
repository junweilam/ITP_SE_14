I was extremely overlooked and my opinion was never considered even though I had more than enough experience and significant educational background to take on more interesting and challenging work. I felt that the team were intimidated by me and did not want to see me prosper or develop. This destroyed my confidence and shattered my self-belief to the point where I just gave up completely due to the negative affect this had on my mental health. Unless you are the right \u201cfit\u201d for the team you will be kept in a box. Senior management patronising and extremely two faced were not able to bring problems to you, would rather talk about you behind your back. Extreme blame culture as significantly inexperienced team members struggled with problems that could be resolved with common sense. It has been months since I left the business and they are still throwing my name about using me as a scapegoat for their lack of competency. It was also Qwhite interesting how they seamlessly devised a plan to push me out the business to replace me with a white female who had no prior HR experience and no higher education background. As someone who had 5 years experience by my time of leaving and two degrees relating to my field of work I find that talent mapping plan Qwhite interesting. These demons did not even get me a leaving card after almost two years.
