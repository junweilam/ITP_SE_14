But that's until you have settled in and you begin to notice not the cracks, but craters among the staff. There are 3 types of people who work at the GMC: (1) Fake, will do absolutely anything to get to know the right people, teamwork takes a backseat if they can push themselves forward, generally cause a lot of noise and fuss about work which can be completed calmly in a methodical way- but that doesn't attract attention right? (2) Real, these people work hard at what they do, they get things done and generally think wtf at the type 1s and culture. They find it amusing to watch type 1's behaviour and will seek to leave asap because they are overworked, under appreciated and receive near enough 0 job satisfaction. (3) A job is a job. This type rely on the good wage and benefits that the GMC provide- they sit there 9 to 5 doing what they have to do and leave. Generally people who need to support a family and those who desire job security above all, are in this category. \r\n\r\n- No appreciation and lack of development: You will work late nights, develop great ideas only for verbal praise. Which is great to a point- but what you really want is the chance to develop, you want to try new things and you want to move upwards. This isn't going to happen, unless you're a Type 1. Generally if you are in an admin post, expect to stay there for at least 5 years before you can 'justify' career development, unless of course you sell your soul and adopt Type 1 techniques. Brown nosing anyone? \r\n\r\n- Company culture: The GMC lives in its own world- an ivory tower. It is not in touch with reality. The fabulous internal comms team will carry out numerous staff meetings and away days to gather staff feedback to shape the company strategy. Very few of these ideas are adopted. They carry out an annual 'Valued Awards' show to say thank-you to staff, the nomination process is laborious in itself. Nothing can be light-hearted and simple at the GMC, in order to nominate another team or colleague you will have to justify why they deserve the award by filling out a form against the 5 company values. Really? \r\n\r\n- Old boy organisation- It's exactly like that. You don't talk to senior members of staff, Council members, the CEO, the COO or the Chair... unless they initiate it. You don't even look at senior members of staff, Council members, the CEO, the COO or the Chair... unless they initiate it. But fret not!

If you have the capacity to cope in that situation then come and join us as it will pass in time and you will see some respite before someone takes exception all over again. Many of us quietly withdraw, keep ourselves under the radar and try to detach from the noise of the platoon of crashing ego's. You can actually move teams to avoid conflict but is that really how we should deal with this? Also, my experience of meetings, forums, feedback sessions is that you're invited to give your point of view, then almost instantly a random colleague, a manager or even the facilitator will make you feel invalid.
