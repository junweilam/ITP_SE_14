The training is rubbish, and everyone knows it! and everyone including management talks about it, and yet month by month they release clueless newbies into the world after \"the induction\". I have seen new advisers come and go because the workload is unbearable. The retention rate is sad. And when they get new team members to \"help\" with the demand, the targets are increasing for the team, so suddenly you are responsible for yours and for that other guy's targets too. In reality, they don't hire more people to help with demand, to help the team cope, they hire more advisers to get more targets and more funding. What a lovely charity organization which makes its own people work like slaves. I stayed there to get more experience because the role itself is indeed fulfilling, but they take every joy out of it. They took a good service and turned it into the copy-past funding-making machine, no wonder they never reach their targets, not only it's impossible. You simply can't influence a person to improve and progress because you don't have enough time for them. Because you know....targets targets targets targets next next next next, that is what you will hear all day every day. P.S. You can actually get additional training if you will find a time which you won't because targets targets targets targets P.P.S. Targets are reduced when you are on annual leave but not when you are sick. Yes, that's right, not only do you have to recover quickly, you then must fight your own colleagues to get a spare appointment first to make your targets because you (or your children) dared to be sick.
