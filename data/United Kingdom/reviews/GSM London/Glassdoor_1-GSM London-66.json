The academic staff are committed with a good balance between those with a long track record in HE and those with significant industry experience. Students recognise this strength in the yearly satisfaction survey and in the more regular module evaluation survey. In my opinion, the focus on personal development and graduate attributes is commendable and best-practice across the sector - you can attribute this to the leadership of the current Provost and Dean of Faculty and the commitment of the wider staff (both academic and non-academic).

Entry requirements seem to be non-existent, the policy seems to be to recruit students regardless of qualification or ability, I witnessed a student applying for an undergraduate course, this student was barely able to read or write in English yet he was asked to complete a form and was accepted onto the course (later withdrawn). Of course GSM's entire income is from SLC funding so the calibre of the student was not a issue. \r\n3. Last summer when the air conditioning broke down (for weeks)  the Provost emailed all staff/students advising them to buy a mini fan and keep it at their desk to keep cool, all staff were also explicitly advised to wear \u201dloose and light clothing\u201d Instead of paying to get the issue fixed, Loose clothing? is this even allowed?!  surely the answer is to install air conditioning or get it fixed? Instead the electricity company were held responsible, yet the incumbent had bought herself a \u00a3500 Dyson blade-less tower fan paid for by the students or SLC rather!!  Amazing!\r\n4. The Company seriously lacks leadership, there appears to be a constant power struggle internally particularly within the Executive team;  all want control, all have little or no experience in HE, in fact the current lacking leader has been running pubs and bowling alleys for the last x years, i'm sure this will be highly relevant as both industries are the same....NOT!  \r\n5. GSM London currently has no business strategy or vision, their sole objective is to make money by mass recruiting students \u2013 as opposed to producing advocates.\r\n6. All employees have to work a compulsory 40 hour week, regardless of salary band. Most often you are working extra hours due to lack of appropriate resourcing.\r\n7. Student experience is not valued by this institution; their philosophy is simply to take money from students or rather the Student loans company.\r\n8. Admin & support staff are at the bottom of the chain, undervalued, underpaid, overworked & often treated with lack of respect or consideration (worse than animals).\r\n9. HR is poor, they solely exist to look after the executive board and the company\u2019s interests as opposed to the well-being of employees. Staff retention rate is a real issue. There is no staff training.\r\n10. No flex or benefits for staff. Extra hours demanded with no remuneration to staff.\r\n11. There are some very unsavory characters at GSM London, so be careful if you plan to study or work here. This includes students and staff. Very high probability of seeing a fight break out on campus, luckily the police station is across the road and they are often called - can be very comedic at times although very disturbing on the whole. \r\n12.

They will scrape the barrel just to get numbers through the door and keep the investors happy.  This results in a very poor quality of student (academically and, in the main, personally) which has knock on effects when it comes to dealing with the problems inherent with that.  This wouldn't be too much of a problem if GSM had the policies in place to actually withdraw students who fail their first year, but with the three enrollment periods and various methods available to undertake a course (full time, part time, accelerated, extended, year zero etc.), GSM just aren't prepared.  I calculated that the first enrollment period I was involved with, only 10% of the student graduated on time.  I monitored it throughout my time there and, despite the huge sums of money pumped into the company, there was no improvement in that figure.  That's awful, and it can ruin students' lives.  They are encouraged to enroll and commit to a course that we all know they aren't going to be able to complete.  This results in students being out of pocket between \u00a33K-\u00a328000.  I've seen it first hand and this is why we have most of the problems I've mentioned above.\r\n\r\nTo try and counter the issue, GSM have put in about 20 layers of management.  There are, honestly, about 3 managers for every ten members of staff.  This means that you can work your bum off all year and the same benefits as someone who does the bare minimum because any form of praise has to go through about five lines of management before it gets to a genuine decision maker.  I feel sorry for a lot of the new staff who come in with hope and ambition because this really isn't the place for them.  I watched souls get destroyed in that place.

Considering the stress you will most likely be under, your teammates are the only people who will be able to understand what you are up against and give advice if ever you become overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe payout that you may receive from GSM London when they fire unjustifiably.\r\n\r\nLeaving GSM London and moving on with life gives one a euphoria which would never have been possible without being an employee of such a terrible organisation.", "cons": "GSM London is very aware that they continually receive negative reviews on Glassdoor from current/former employees. Instead of attempting to change how the institution is run, the management hold \"all-staff meetings\" in which they try their best to discredit all negative Glassdoor reviews. Any current staff member who implies that these negative Glassdoor reviews may be credible is made to feel as if they have committed high treason; HR then include this in your personal file to use against you whenever needed.\r\n\r\nGSM London has a lot of polices, which they expect all staff member to be aware of, however, these policies are rarely enforced; usually they are only enforced to protect GSM London against its staff and students when GSM London's reputation is at stake.\r\n\r\nLots of staff at GSM London say and do things openly which proves that the institution does not enforce policies relating to:\r\n- Discrimination (race; gender; sexuality; religion; class; age; physical appearance; intelligence; etc)\r\n- Bullying\r\n- Confidentiality\r\n- Dishonesty\r\n(In my experience, the management are the worst culprits.)\r\n\r\nManagement habitually hire their own unemployed relatives and uneducated childhood friends. Although the organisation is quite big, the number of employees who are related by blood is probably higher than you imagine. This is not necessarily a bad thing but can easily become a bad thing when abused, as it often is by some.\r\n\r\nPromotions are often given to staff members based on friendship statuses and most people who are lucky enough to be promoted are promised the promotion long before the job is advertised; if you are not invited to apply for a promotion, you are most likely not getting the job.\r\n\r\nThe organisation is extremely disorganised and your daily responsibilities are subject to change (and will do so, very often). HR are known for losing copies of important documents of GSM London staff (passports; contracts; qualifications; references) and never have a decent explanation as to how this is possible and why it happens so frequently.\r\n\r\nMembers of management appear to be in competition with some of their own members of staff and dedicate a lot of time spreading lies about said staff members, in order to publicly tarnish their reputations and force them out of the organisation.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted about particular issues, members of management have a very convenient ability of forgetting a lot of important things which were said or done which would present themselves in a negative light.\r\n\r\nGSM London pays its staff quite low salaries (except for the friends or family of management), despite experience or educational backgrounds. Although GSM London's staff are paid lower than they would be doing similar jobs in other London-based institutions, the most efficient members of staff will constantly be forced to take on an ever-growing list of extra responsibilities, whilst most likely receiving sheer disrespect from management. \r\n\r\nGSM London are known for tricking candidates throughout the job interviewing process into accepting lower salaries, as they often lie about how much work is really involved within some roles. This leads to GSM London (only sometimes) recruiting high-calibre staff, who then resign very quickly; only weeks later, in some cases.\r\n\r\nAlthough GSM London claim that their focus is on Widening Participations, this REALLY is not the case. GSM London (who still does not have university status and hopefully never will) typically enrols students who have little or no educational background, providing these students with a false hope that they will actually be able to graduate one day; the student retention rate is shockingly low at GSM London for a valid reason. Being an employee at GSM London may sometimes feel criminal for this reason alone.\r\n\r\nPerformance-related annual bonuses are virtually non-existent (unless you have the word \"manager\" in your job title). GSM London only ever rewards the exact same people continuously for their \"hard work and effort\" whilst at least 90% of their staff are never ever even mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf you join GSM London, be careful who you end up working for, as unfair treatment by managers is often swept under the rug by HR, despite how many complaints are made against them.\r\n\r\nLife at GSM London is slightly more bearable if you are able to accept being treated badly by your manager. If you are known for defending yourself, you will be labelled a troublemaker and GSM London will try to get rid of you by any means necessary, even going so far as recommending that you find another job elsewhere. Be prepared to see your teammates/colleagues in tears because of something a line manager did or said to them. \r\n\r\nGSM London gossip is rife and you must be careful picking the colleagues that you choose to confide in, as telling the wrong person anything about yourself will become common knowledge throughout the institution (once again, managers are the worst culprits). Even lies spread about you will most likely be treated as gospel. The only way to ensure that you are not at the centre of gossip at GSM London is to remain unknown; yes, even the most popular and most-adored members of staff will still suffer negative rumours attached to their names. \r\n\r\nIf you are fired from GSM London, HR will probably threaten you with a lawsuit if you so happen to ever tell anyone what was actually discussed in your disciplinary meeting or if you ever mention the fact that you received a substantial payout from GSM London for an undisclosed reason."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Do not bother wasting your time or energy at GSM", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 Dec 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff for the most part. Most teams get along and everyone is pretty sociable. This can lead to a laid back atmosphere in most teams which is quite good more often then not.", "cons": "Ermmm pretty much everything at this point to be honest. \r\nI've seen other reviews that say GSM is fast paced or not for the faint hearted. \r\nI prefer the term unorganised, nothing in this place is truly planned for other than not paying staff correctly or making excuses in not being able to pay bonuses. \r\n\r\nEverything in GSM is \"improving in phases\" according to senior management. \r\nThis is a company that at one point had one person as a HR department -_-. Following that a new head was put into place with an actual team and all they could do was apologise every time an issue was brought up to them rather than actually resolve them.\r\nMinutes were conveniently lost or misplaced so meetings never had factual back up\u2019s. Now through to the latest incarnation of HR, you have a team that literally ignore claims and requests. \r\nI can appreciate that a HR department is there to protect the company as well as see employees are treated fairly (conflict of interest???) but surely there should be procedures or at the very least guidelines in places. It seems you can only get things resolved by putting serious pressure on every person involved, testimonies are not taken and rather than actually dealing with issues at hand you're constantly giving the run around. \r\n\r\nThe same goes for the majority of managers \"I'm looking into it give me some time\" for weeks/months on end. Nobody below senior management is actually respected or valued apart from the very few that are favourites of management. I quote \"You're all replaceable\" is something I've heard many times over the years. There's trying to motivate your team in different ways then completely demoralising them. \r\nThis place will literally will suck the energy and productivity out of you if you allow it too. You can work yourself to the bone, do everything asked and beyond but it\u2019s never enough. You'll never do enough to get any more than a 2% rise if anything at all because the company don't want to pay anymore. Bear in mind the large majority in the company are underpaid and in some places criminally so in my opinion. \r\n\r\nStaff salaries were benchmarked by Hayes and apparently compared against roles everywhere else but nobody has ever seen the result of this and certainly haven't had any rises. \r\nYou will get screwed out of commission/bonuses constantly and having written agreements reneged on. But that's only if you're fortunate enough to get an actual contract at some point in your employment. \r\nIf you change roles within the company don't expect any type of formal change, at best you will be given an amendment letter and if you request your contract you will be met with a wall of silence. I've actually been asked for a copy of my contract when I haven't had one for TWO years. \r\n\r\nYou only get 5 sick days in a calendar year which to me is unheard of in most businesses. What happens if you happen to even have a bad cold a few times in a year god forbid anything more serious. Non-existent benefits 1% pension contribution that wasn't voluntary and when trying to opt out being told it wasn't possible. \r\n\r\nNot to mention if you're in a student facing role you will definitely get screamed at a few times. Some of these are definitely people with mental issues. But a large proportion of them are people that have been pushed to the absolute edge by GSM. Some of the stories I've heard from students have been horrific at times. Students have lost their homes because they've been told when to expect student finance and not received for another 3 months. Fair enough you shouldn't bank your life on student finance but its still terrible advice\r\nOnce people are in \"the system\" everything goes downhill, any online promotion gets tons of hateful comments by bitter current or ex-students. \r\n\r\nLast couple of points here (I could go allllll day long)\r\nNo bonuses were paid this year as the company didn't meet targets which could be a bit more understandable if we didn't withdraw tons of students in the first 2 weeks as we don't have satisfactory attendance tracking systems. Student's ID cards don't work or their timetables are wrong so they have no registered attendance and get withdrawn. \r\n\r\nNo bonuses were justified by saying \"at least we didn't have to make redundancies\" which they did 3 years ago with \"last in, first out\" policy dropping about 20 people across both campuses."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Enjoying the role and company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Mar 2017", "job_title": "Senior Manager in Greenwich, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people, change management, salary, proactive CEO.

Just to give a small tiny example;  back in 2013 they introduced new programmes called \"Events Management\" but this course was not designated by SLC yet, an internal email memo circulated by head management to all finance department staff members to what to say and answer any student whom wanted to study this programme. Students were told to lie SLC that they were studying someother programme after that school will validate their SLC to withdraw their fee funds and release their maintenance money.\r\nJust a tiny example what this college will do for money from taxpayers. \r\nThis college is for profit only and nothing else. \r\nIf you are working down the chain, you will have no value..

They even print double Student ID cards to for them so that someother person will come and swipe instead. They (school) assign external people to do these students assignments and sit their exams.
