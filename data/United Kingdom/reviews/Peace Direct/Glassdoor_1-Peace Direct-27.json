The only fault I think he has (which he is well aware of) is that he sometimes takes on too much.\r\n\r\n- This is a great place to work if you're early on in your career. As a small charity, staff get involved in all sorts of different aspects of the work, meaning you get a broader range of experience than you would in a similar role at a large organisation. \r\n\r\n- The people are so friendly and supportive. This is the best team I've ever worked with. \r\n\r\n- Peace Direct is very self aware and reflective as an organisation. They take the time to ask themselves the difficult questions, to consider ripping up the plan of it's not working, and to put in the work to change so they can best meet the needs of local peacebuilders. \r\n\r\n- They are a fair employer, and really respect the commitments they make to employees. Difficult staff aren't pushed out, but are worked with and pushed to be better. \r\n\r\n- Their level of diversity and inclusion is great. As a person of colour, I felt satisfied with how highly diversity was valued. The unconscious bias training we did a few years ago seemed to have gone down well across the entire team, which says a lot.\r\n\r\n- There's a lot of trust. I was trusted to get on with my work and wasn't micromanaged. There was also freedom to fail. It was a good environment if you're creative or innovative.", "cons": "- As a small organisation, there aren't many opportunities for promotion. I saw lots of talented people move to other organisations because they were offered more senior and better paid roles which weren't even on the horizon at Peace Direct.\r\n\r\n- The office space isn't the best. It's not bad, it used to be terrible, but it's not up to the standards of many London based professional companies. \r\n\r\n- The pay isn't brilliant. It has increased significantly since I started at Peace Direct, but I would say it's below average for the roles I held, even allowing for the fact that it's a charity employer.\r\n\r\n- If there's a toxic or bad employee, you're stuck with them until they either leave or underperform so badly that they get fired. But I can't imagine Peace Direct firing someone, they're too nice to do that without gross misconduct being the issue.\r\n\r\n- Workload was always an issue. I always felt overloaded and behind, and struggled to leave work at work. I often worked over my hours.
