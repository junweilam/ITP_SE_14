Times might be harsh in a climate of cuts after cuts after cuts in the mental health sector - but instead of focusing on expansion and investing in a really good marketing department which is actually able to make you look so convincingly likeable and caring - instead of that please go back a lot of steps and think about your ethics and the quality you are providing: for people who use your services as well as all your employees. Please stop throwing around all these good sounding terms such as \"co-working\" between employees and \"people who use the services\" and go on about how we're all having an equal \"big conversation\". If anything has been working out at your services it is because the people who are working for you directly with the service users are giving their all and everything and actually care while still getting low wages and not being taken care of very well. Before this place turned into this chaotic state there were actually success stories of people who were able to benefit and develop which is so sad. Now I don't believe that anyone in the decision making ranks of management do give a damn about ethics.
