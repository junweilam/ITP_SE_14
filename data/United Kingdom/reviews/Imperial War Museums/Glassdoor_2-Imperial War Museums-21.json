I'm yet to see anyone lose their temper or treat a colleague poorly. There exists an \"all in it together\" attitude which means you may be expected to help out in some areas that are not your primary job, though this will be rare and dependent on your role and seniority. From my experience the managers are flexible and allow you to work your job around your life requirements, perfect if you have children for example. \r\n\r\nThere's ample opportunity for you to find other roles within the company if you feel like making a change in job but not location and of course IWM has 5 different locations in England so theoretically you could simply relocate office if you move home. Salaries are competitive if you work in a \"market role\" and benefits are very good, lot of leave, pension contribution is fantastic and a bonus is available at the end of financial year. Union presence exists but is in no way overbearing for management.", "cons": "For the reasons above the company typically attracts 2 kinds of people, those who (usually for family reasons) need a job that is flexible and less pressuring with good benefits. The other type of person is the type that comes and goes very quickly, working usually a year or two before moving on. This, coupled with the fact that the teams are quite small and sparse, creates a high turnover environment and leaves the institution with a a bit of an unsociable group of people who tend not to get to know one another very deeply at all. Not a problem for introverts but the more outgoing of us may find this a quite different environment to what theyre used to. It's not very customer facing, unless you work FOH or in a security function and so the interaction with the outside world can also seem limiting however this can depend on your role. Chances of moving upwards can seem slim as the lifer crew have nailed down many of their jobs, however it is worth noting I write this with most of my experience at my job coming from during a pandemic....\r\n\r\nNot much in the way of training or self improvement, team meetings and activities are very few and you're generally left to your own devices, again this can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nLastly, as money is mostly bought in through donations and government funding, coupled with the high turnover problem that was aforementioned, projects tend to be quite large but not very frequent and the planning stage seems to run for a very long time as project managers change hands and individual managers have their own ideas about how to run things. Money for these things usually runs out quite quickly and the plan has be scaled down dramatically, this can lead to an unfortunate drop in quality/opportunity for your team."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Constant restructuring", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "3 Oct 2017", "job_title": "Mid-Level Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing knowledge base of First World War through to modern day conflicts across the globe.
