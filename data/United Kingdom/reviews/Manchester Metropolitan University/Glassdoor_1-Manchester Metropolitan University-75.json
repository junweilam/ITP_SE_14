The HR department is in disarray and my contract and working hours were not clearly identified when I started work. I had to actively hound HR in order to find out what my entitlements and benefits were. Fast forward to the last week of the academic year and I was told that I owed extra hours that had to be worked off during the summer (I was term time only). \r\n\r\nThere are significant issues in the department I worked in (somewhere within the School of Art). Communication is minimal and there's not much done to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Very often important information wasn't circulated amongst team members, messages were often in the form of one line emails or verbal mentions. This resulted in the team being very reactive, inefficient and reliant on ad hoc problem solving - which isn't bad in itself, but the department is primarily a busy counter service and this had an adverse effect on the service provided. \r\n\r\nThe team doesn't work as a unit, but rather, as a group of individuals who work on their own. This had a negative impact on the day and night shifts, seasonal events (such as degree shows) and the overall experience of working in the department. As result, the service we were providing to students (and staff) could be incredibly slow, frustrating and fractious. The team have settled into bad habits and certain staff members were able to hide behind admin work at times, creating the illusion that they were working when basically they weren't pulling their weight. Some team members have been working here for so long that they've been ignored and left to do what they please, unmonitored. This invites an attitude of apathy and laziness.\r\n\r\nA massive problem is the team's attitude: They can be aloof, arrogant and disrespectful towards both students and fellow staff. Incoming queries and emails were often treated as inconveniences. Certain students and staff were singled out as \"trouble\" - a huge problem considering this department is supposed to offer technical support and assistance. At the worst times, the team and the department was a hinderance and an obstacle for a student trying to organise a project, or a staff member trying to book out a TV. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I became incredibly frustrated with the team. Even the most basic things took a long time to address (it took 9 months for me to be added to a team calendar. It took 9 months to get a t-shirt that fit. It took 9 months for my contract and working hours to get finalised). Worst of all, when I took my concerns to my manager (who actually listened and took everything I said on board), I was reassured that all of these issues would be mitigated with the introduction of a new computer system and team member., which was just another way of passing the buck and not facing the real issues."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great staff stifled by poor leadership and senior management promoting sel-interest.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Jun 2014", "job_title": "Central Support in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lot's of great staff wanting and trying to make a difference.", "cons": "Generally managers only concerned about self-interest.
