In my experience and what I have noticed in late hours in the office is that IT and Logistics tend to be very overworked and in the office during very late hours.  Finance and HR seem to leave at normal hours.  Staff working for and with international staff in all departments are expected to work long hours to account for the difference in timezone.  I would advise that you be clear on the expectation of your role and department before taking a job with Save because work/life balance can be either very good or non-existent depending on what you are accountable for and/or the competency of your management line.  I would ask many questions in your interview of what your deliverables/expectations are, and stick to that, and remind management/HR of your original commitment if it becomes a problem (see cons)  \r\n\r\nLocation of office behind Trafalgar Square is good for after work hours activities, including many movie premiers (though due to the cons below I very rarely took advantage of this!)", "cons": "The organisation/senior leadership oversells/overcommits itself, and then expects their staff to pick up the slack.  The further down the management line you go, the worse the pressure is.  \"Pressure\" is a word that is used a great deal at Save.  As a result, staff members get burnt out and leave.  For many, work/life balance is non-existence and people often go on sick leave and have physical, mental and emotional health problems.  The rate of turnover both in London and in country is extremely high and has a great impact on teams and the end result of all initiatives / projects.  I have heard that experience at a Save the Children member (such as SC US, SC UK or SC Denmark) is remarkably different.  Note that SCI is a young organisation, as it is part of a wider re-organisation effort to unify all the individual members.       \r\n\r\nBecause of the overcommitment, getting capacity from people not under your direct control can be excrutiatingly difficult.  People will often do anything to get out of additional work and/or making a decision - not because they don't care but because they do not have clear priorities because they have been asked to do too much.  There is a big problem with \"lip service\" where people say they will do something, then do not do it (especially if they are not accountable).   \r\n\r\nIt may seem trite but the office space is not adequate.  This makes planning for collaborative sessions very difficult, and at the last minute impossible.  They have a \"hot desking\" approach which means that many staff have to find a new seat daily which can be annoying when you have alot to do in the morning.  I have sometimes switched desks twice a day which was very distracting.  If the office is busy, there is no where to take a private phone call - and if they hold a training or seminar collaborating with your peers is logistically very difficult.  It's also an open plan office with too many people, and is not a very conducive environment for \"heads down\" work.  Senior leadership get defensive when you raise this as an issue, and expect you to put in hours to make up for the lack of ability to collaborate due to both office space issues and lack of capacity and turnover issues.  The good news is that most managers do allow for some work from home for desk work, however you may find yourself on the phone and wishing you had just gone in.  Many people agree with me in that actual office environment is a very stressful place."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Greatest Disappointment", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "2 Sept 2020", "job_title": "Project Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Relatively well-developed programmes for children, although the commitment to serve human dignity and children is not fully visible among staff in the Centre. \r\n\r\nThe Centre serves as the global hub, and colleagues took their jobs as any corporate job without any particular commitment to serving humans and children.
