It feels as if they don't trust their own employees to do their work competently. Every little task and decision is scrutinised, stifling any sense of autonomy or creativity. It's suffocating to work under such constant surveillance, and it's no wonder that morale among the staff is low. Instead of fostering an atmosphere of collaboration and support, the culture is rife with suspicion and a constant fear of making mistakes. This lack of trust erodes any sense of teamwork and hinders productivity. Moreover, professional development at Scope is virtually nonexistent - unless you're senior staff or managers. The limited opportunities for growth are merely lip service. The company fails to provide adequate resources, training, and mentorship to help employees develop their skills and advance in their careers. It's clear that the company views its workforce as expendable. One frustrating aspect of working at Scope is its hiring processes. There is a blatant disregard for the talent and potential already within the organisation. This not only stifles motivation but also fosters an environment of resentment and favoritism. All of these issues contribute to an alarming staff turnover rate that plagues every sector within the company. It's not surprising to see employees leaving a year into the role. The constant turnover creates an atmosphere of instability and unrest, making it even harder to build a cohesive and high-performing team. The cumulative effect of these problems on mental health cannot be understated. The constant micromanagement, lack of trust, limited chances for growth have taken a severe toll on the well-being of employees. The stress, anxiety, and frustration that come with working in such an unhealthy environment are detrimental to one's mental health and overall quality of life."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Badly run organisation", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 May 2023", "job_title": "Fundraising in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good cause and great volunteers", "cons": "executive team don't know what they're doing, hired people with no experience to run teams who knew more than they did.

Scope has huge potential but the cons outweigh the pros! \n\nOffice location\nWhile the office is new and sparkly, the location is out in the sticks and is really too small for the workforce. You have to get a shuttle bus to the campus and they can delay you greatly. On site there are no shops to grab a quick bite and the nearest canteen will be charging you \u00a37 for a hot meal! \nYou can only eat in the kitchen (even snacks!) which means that during lunch the whole office is noisy and there are limited places to sit. The summer is fine as the weather is lovely but I am dreading the winter. \nNo where to have private conversations as everything is open plan so I sat next to someone getting scolded during a 121. Yes! It was in the open and this is common. Since moving, I have heard two colleagues inform their manager of a family death, that they would be having a probation review and that changes were being made to a team before it was announced! No privacy and the meeting rooms are way too small for the organisation.\n\nThere is no reception once you reach the floor where the office is on and also no CCTV on the floor (I lost something and asked security to check! They couldn\u2019t!) which is dangerous for staff and visitors. The doors stay open for a long while so anyone could walk in. \n\nSenior Level management \nHands down, this is the worst senior level management that I have worked for. EB do not like each other and you can tell- they are hostile towards each other and even to staff. Directors will not say hello to staff in the canteen or if they are sitting next to you but promote \u2018a friendly culture\u2019 and have all the correct words to try and facilitate what they want workers to achieve.\nLots of unfair promotions, sabbaticals and redundancies, whenever the director feels like it. I have witnessed three on the spot sabbaticals by one director since I joined in January, one promotion to a job which was not advertised and the director made it up and countless redundancies or firing! They fire a lot before probation so employees have no leg to stand on. There is no leadership at all and all just feels like a huge mess! \nA change of culture needs to happen and good people are leaving due to the politics which you wouldn\u2019t expect in a charity, especially a disability charity.\n\nHR\nHR is not there to be a diplomat but is ALWAYS on the side of the manager and lots of corrupt proceedings going on. Many good employees will disappear \u2018into the night\u2019 after being scapegoated or forced out due to not being liked by senior management. This always happens during probation so ensure that everything is in writing, however, it makes no difference as all final decisions are by the \u2018manager\u2019. Even though it is a disability charity, they DO NOT lead by example and create a positive workforce for disabled employees. If you have a disability that requires adjustments, they will make the adjustments, as they are required by law. However, if you have suffer from mental disability then I would avoid at all costs. There is nothing in place to help colleagues or even assist managers and in the words of HR \u2018you cost Scope money when you are not in\u2019.\nHR are very lackadaisical, it took 3 months to amend my NI number due to no one responding but it\u2019s a joke without scope that if you are going to contact HR, you will get laughs.\nThey are trying to promote employers to hire disabled people but in actual fact are failing in their own organisation! \n\nLots of corruption and office politics which you would expect from a large corporate organisation.

Of course you will find it everywhere you go, and here it is important to know that it is often behind the scenes and insidious. It felt cutthroat and bloodthirsty to me. Bullying in supervisions, in isolation, and restricting your development can be expected.\r\n\r\nI was being bullied by a person who managed another team working closely with mine. She was bullying her entire team, who I was friends with, and one of them was forced to resign by her and my manager (in part because of her disability). They pushed her out in the same way they did me, only I kept fighting for my job until I was eventually dismissed. They absolutely humiliated her, publicly shaming her. Poor girl. This particular person was slowly trying to gain control within my team, and it feels that my manager was being controlled by her. I didn't know who my manager was! It was all very bizarre. Her behaviour was very aggressive, intimidating, and she publicly embarrassed me in front of close work colleagues. I raised a grievance about this behaviour, and about my manager's aggressive, bullying behaviour and of course this led to me being dismissed. The entire process of raising a grievance is very humiliating, appalling, and disgusting - they do not care to support their employees, especially those with disabilities. Seeing duplicity and sociopathy at play was quite disturbing. My manager had been bullying me in isolation - her insecurities, borderline personality disorder, and inadequacies made me a 'threat' because I was confident, competent, and a good performer. She tried to convince me that I wasn't performing, even though she barely spent any time with me and dismissed all of my progress/development reports/efforts, and kept pushing and pushing me. The team I worked with were mostly very knowledgeable, intelligent, and capable people, but it felt that everyone was of a fixed mindset and didn't want to celebrate each other's successes or develop. There was a lot of tension, my manager often complained to me about everyone (again, super unprofessional), and I felt my enthusiasm and smarts were deliberately ignored. \r\n\r\nDO NOT disclose your disability or mental health issues if you can so help it. It will be used against you. My manager made me feel as though I could trust her, opening up about her issues (very unprofessional) to give me a false sense of security, and then used my mental health issues against me. She did not support me at all. I was lucky my work colleagues gave me strong support and helped me understand it was her who had the problem, and not me. In fact, she projected all of her issues onto me. Yes, I have mental health issues, but I am very healthy and get on well at work. It was horrible to see that twisted, as if I wasn't capable to do my job. Her behaviour was pitiful and pathetic, and she was too busy studying at university to put in the effort of managing about 16 people I think it was. Totally discriminated against, and in raising my grievance I really could see how they don't care at all for their disabled employees. They all have the same attitude and response, so I know it isn't only my manager who is like that. \r\n\r\nThe work culture and vibe is very weird. Everybody does their best to look down, avoid each other, and everything feels very stuck in its ways, rigid, and outdated. I think it's slowly improving, but it's all quite weird. They don't want anyone to progress, the managers are of course unskilled and are resting on their laurels. They don't want innovators or creatives, they want yes people who will act as robots. I was completely underappreciated, none of my efforts were noticed, and they did not care about development. \r\n\r\nFinally the CEO is holding meetings for 15 minutes each week, and they're finally hearing about what people do, because no one knows what anyone does. It's a charity that hasn't done much in the way of bringing teams and employees together. Again, all rather weird. It was like being in the twilight zone. Management will ignore everyone as much as they can. I never once heard anyone outside of his immediate crew say hello to Mark Atkinson, and him say anything back. He constantly looks down and avoids everyone. Very bad example being set there. Yes, you may be a busy man, but you owe it to your employees to at least be friendly and smile. \r\n\r\nI have heard many people complaining about Scope, whether it be about pay, the culture, the management, the work environment, and the benefits. \r\n\r\nMy experience was very degrading, but I met many nice people there and I think for the most part the work people do is meaningful and important. It isn't entirely pathologically organised like some other organisations, but management does seem avoidant, neglectful, and unskilled. \r\n\r\nWould I recommend working here? In short, no.
