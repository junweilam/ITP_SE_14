The University\u2019s leadership is woeful and its new owners, Galileo Global Education, are focused exclusively on making money. Making money is not a bad thing, but when it involves treating your staff unethically and inhumanely in order to do so, well, you can be the judge of if that\u2019s the kind of company you would like to work for. \r\n\r\nThe organisation\u2019s complete restructure has involved chucking nearly 100 staff to the kerb, just two weeks before Christmas, and in the middle of a pandemic - through both VR \u201copportunities\u201d and a disingenuous interview process for \u201cnew\u201d roles leading to forced redundancies. Perhaps worst of all, the restructure has left behind a workforce of both academic and professional staff who do not understand the logic of the restructure or how it will be possible to complete essential business processes in the future. \r\n\r\nPerhaps most concerning is that some of the University\u2019s leadership are so ignorant about the regulatory obligations that apply to the University, that it is only a matter of time before the Office for Students, Quality Assurance Agency and Home Office begin to uncover serious issues and concerning practices.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the University\u2019s salaries are also very low, even by sector standards. They attempt to address this by providing staff with a \u00a33 per day credit in the refectory, but it does not substitute proper compensation.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a small, for profit university, Regent\u2019s is struggling to find its way. As an employee you can be assured of little job security, little opportunity to advance your career internally, and little hope of inspiring leadership to plot a way forward. Regent\u2019s is going to be a pretty grim place to work for at least the next 12 to 18 months, and even after that time, unless there is recognition of the issues and significant movement to make improvements."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "30 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working environment and nice staff", "cons": "Long hours and tight deadlines"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Visa Officer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "working in a beautiful park and stipend for lunch", "cons": "low salary and no room for growing"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "General", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 May 2021", "job_title": "Sales in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary is not too bad", "cons": "No Union, no flexible working hours, restructuring all the time..."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Not a good place to work Avoid!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Not many - a few nice colleagues.
