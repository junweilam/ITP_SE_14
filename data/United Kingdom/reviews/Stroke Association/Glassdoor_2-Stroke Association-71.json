I will always be proud to say that I worked for such a great charity that put their employees' wellbeing at the heart of everything they do. The commitment and passion into providing life after stroke support was fantastic too.\r\n\r\nHowever, as an employee, I was fully on board with the journey that Stroke Association wanted to go on in terms of allowing employees to express themselves and be trusted to do the jobs they have been employed to do - the 'theory Y' approach. There is no admin heavy, tedious appraisal system. Instead (well, from my experience) regular, relatively informal conversations with my manager was a great approach in managing me.\r\n\r\nIn my time a new CEO came in and positive changes over the last few years have been very tangible. I know just before I left there was either a 5% (or 5.5% depending on role) uplift. Compared to the NHS and other health charities this is fantastic, and to me shows a well managed charity when they can offer this sort of uplift with everything going on in the world.\r\n\r\nEmployee benefits were fantastic too, and it seemed to me the charity never stops looking at what else they can offer their staff e.g. a great EAP, health cash plan, mental health first aiders etc.\r\n\r\nThere has been a new learning management system which is fantastic - an improvement that needed to be made.\r\n\r\nI do believe Stroke Association are great at listening to their employees, and regularly conduct 'Engagement Surveys', feed back the results and look to make changes based on this. Results are pretty much always better than the sector average which I think says a lot. \r\n\r\nThere are regular 'Ask Juliet' sessions - which gives everyone an opportunity to ask our CEO any questions they may have. Juliet (CEO) is very visible across the organisation - nothing worse than a CEO that employees never see! :-)\r\n\r\nThe communication across the charity is very good. To those staff that disagree with this, there is some effort on your part to actually look at the Intranet, open and read emails, attend meetings etc. What? You want all the information put in your brain with a magic wand!\r\n\r\nThe charity is a remote working business too, for me this was great when we were contracted to work from home. There are processes and opportunities to collaborate with colleagues too.", "cons": "I did think at one point the organisation was a little top heavy with people as line managers. Stroke Association has been through a restructure recently which I think has helped eradicate this. In my role one of my biggest bugbears was the massive lack of knowledge and inconsistency amongst managers and how they would treat their staff. I had to do a lot of 'hand-holding'.\r\n\r\nHowever, before I left I know the charity were introducing new manager training (which I inputted into) to try and help managers know what they should be doing as a manager at Stroke Association.\r\n\r\nThe company intranet is rather frustrating to use and very difficult to find anything. I believe they would benefit from a proper document management system.\r\n\r\nFrom personal experience I did always dread having to contact our IT department - I often felt I was inconveniencing them and putting them out, particularly if I had to call them. Some better customer service from IT please :-)"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "review", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "17 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Regional Fundraiser in Belfast, Northern Ireland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Promotes inclusivity\r\nGood Leadership within the charity structure", "cons": "few opportunities for career enhancement"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Flexible, caring  organisation to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "17 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Stroke Coordinator in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lovely colleagues and a rewarding job.
