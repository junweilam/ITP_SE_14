Show any weakness at all and you will be toast. During my time there the threat of redundancy was held over everyone's heads as if it were their chosen management tool, and to a point it worked! They had people working 12 hour days, played people off against each other for roles that may or may not appear in 6 months time, and hired people knowing they would have to make them redundant.
