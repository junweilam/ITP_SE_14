Many new degrees have been launched and the hiring, however conspicuous, hasn't kept up, with teaching increasingly given out to contract lecturers or PhDs. Moreover, the research environment, while on the one hand foraged with much financial investment, has also been a paramount example of the negativity of REF politics. The strategising around research submissions has left many people at the margins, breeding frustration and resentment.
