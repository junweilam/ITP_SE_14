Many are very intelligent and very generous with their time, and will often step in to assist you if you reciprocate. In previous years, many Business School staff had spent significant time in industry and the professions, had a good working style, were down-to-earth and integrated new staff.  Work life balance has been generally reasonable, although exam marking is always a fraught period.  Business school staff have free tea and coffee. There have been some genuinely great innovations by staff in courses, teaching, learning and research.  Remuneration is slightly ahead of similar institutions. Collegiality within departments is generally very good.  General IT resources are good, although sometimes technical support is not always forthcoming. There are some great architectural buildings, and some great places to teach.", "cons": "The emphasis on \"business style\" management in recent years is stifling, imposing several expensive and unproductive management layers, and has promulgated some dubious practices. Senior Management approaches to HR relations are a caricature of a poor 1970-80's manufacturing industrial case study, rather than enlightened practices for 21st century knowledge workers. Good quality, transparent leadership is lacking. Promotions appear to be determined on your face fitting with management, rather than on capability to achieve outcomes. Pressure to inflate grades is also high.\r\n\r\nThe business school was a good school with inventive teaching and some credible researchers. However, many academic staff with excellent industrial knowledge and connections have left, to the detriment of standards. These industrially astute staff are rarely replaced because of recruitment policies requiring applicants to have research backgrounds, rather than industrial capability and teaching ability. This has resulted in the recruitment of several career academics without business experience (often new, young, international PHDs), perhaps to the detriment of graduate employability, and probably contributing to staff turnover rates as they leave after a couple of years. The reason behind the recruitment policy change is the pursuit of often unachievable international 'badges' by school managers, mainly due to their misunderstanding of the school's unique selling points; management style often focuses on (perceived) activity rather than actual achievement. This propagates reactionary change projects which are often detrimental to both staff morale and ability to do the day-to-day work of teaching and research. Accommodation for business school staff is an unsatisfying compromise between open plan and academic team-shared offices, where one often tumbles over colleagues or (if one is portly as I am) is a disturbing squeeze past co-workers in an attempt to exit. Even professors must share accommodation.\r\n\r\nDisappointingly, what was once a great place to work as a solid teaching institution with great industrial & local links, and credible research, has now become a stressful, pressurised, place to do a job with weaker teaching, poorer local industrial links and only marginally better research."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Allowed me to discover my potential and skills I didn't know I had.", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Admissions Officer in Nottingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people - caring colleagues - change and challenges are common, can be rewarding, and develop skills.", "cons": "Changing times in the HE sector would make it difficult to know what or how things may develop in the short- to long-term."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great colleagues but a very difficult place to produce high quality research", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Aug 2019", "job_title": "Research Associate in Nottingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Generous annual leave entitlement and remuneration.
