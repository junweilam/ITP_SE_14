They believe that computers should be binned, because they would much rather have a busty blonde make them tea and type their notes. Out of touch with reality.\r\nThe entire culture at Ben is based on having meetings for the sake of having meetings, which are, just like this whole organisation, a massive waste of everyone's time.\r\nThe consultation about staff's contract changes was an absolute disaster and to be honest, I am extremely surprised that Ben has not been taken to court. \r\nManagement promotes people, who get their nose brown and cannot possibly see their lack of knowledge, qualifications, passion and general tact. People, who are literally mentally unstable and incapable of performing most basic, day-to-day tasks are being kept on board. However, staff that are brilliant and willing to go the extra mile are overlooked for a promotion over and over again till... You guessed it! They leave! \r\nSalaries of HO are unrealistically high for most,  yet no consequences are being carried out when mistakes are made. 'Oooops. Let's move on.'\r\nI think Ben's philosophy can be best described as 'Let's see how much can we sweep under the carpet without people realising.' \r\nThere were too many instances of disciplinary actions due to discrimination and harassment.  HR always magically sways  in favour of the accused, as they are normally higher up the food chain than the staff filing these. They dismiss them with 'get on with your life' and no further action is taken. If they listened, Ben would have saved themselves some big bucks by getting rid of absolute time wasters years ago. \r\nBottom line is that I honestly do not understand how this place is still open.
