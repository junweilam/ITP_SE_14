I have had such a great experience with the company even from the recruitment proces, everyone has been really supportive even whilst working from home during Covid-19. \r\n\r\nThe interview process was great and the team kept me updated at all stages (3 stages to the interview process). The training was good when I joined, my team and manager went out of their way to help me so that I could achieve in the role. \r\n\r\nThe benefits are good - money off health care, illness cover, massages in the office.

Before this and the previous job I held, I've had every bad job under the sun for every bad company that don't know how to treat their employees with dignity and respect. \r\n\r\nReading some of the reviews recently by disgruntled ex and current staff, it's very upsetting to have this company questioned in this way. I haven't had that Sunday night dread once in the entire time I've worked here. Even on its worst day, it's a million times better than anywhere else I've worked. \r\n\r\nPeople complaining about having to work weekends. Nobody has to work weekends, nobody. But it IS essentially, for some, a Sales Job and if you're struggling to hit your target, it's in your interest to put in more hours. We've all done it, I've done it, it's how you get good at something, then you don't have to do it as much, pretty simple\r\n\r\nAlong with being left alone to run your own business, weekly massages, beer fridge, company events and nights out, regularly breakfasts, lunches, meals bought for us, Amazon Vouchers and most importantly, a relaxed environment where everybody keeps everybody in check. It's not hard to quickly be reminded of the exceptionally likable atmosphere we've all contributed to over the years\r\n\r\nThe fact that since I've been here, over 5 years plus, multiple staff who have left have almost instantly regretted it and tried to come back, many successfully, because you'd be pressed to find a better place to work in Brighton / Hove \r\n\r\nI think some people haven't got a clue about how lucky they are to work in such an unbelievably supportive and relaxed environment. The Director very much cares about people and that can be seen both indirectly and directly on regularly occasion. \r\n\r\nIf anything, the company has been extremely lenient with people and almost give them too much of a chance to prove themselves. It's a sales role, it is competitive, but it's also consultative and the company is making huge changes to make this an even better place, not just for our staff, but for the students we enrol", "cons": "Of course this company isn't perfect, but some of these reviews are so nakedly transparent, they absolutely reek of bitterness. Rather than hold themselves accountable for not being able to do the job and learn what's needed, they simply blame the company.  We've had multiple new people come in to the company in the last 6 months and absolutely smash it out of the park, so what's different about them? Why are they able to do it? Possibly attitude? Possibly perspective, patience and willing to learn? \r\n\r\nSales isn't for everybody and this company gives people more than a fair chance. There were people working here for years that should have been cut far sooner, the kindness of management is really the only genuine criticism you could point to in that area\r\n\r\nAt times, this company could be seen more like a family; there's squabbles, rivalries and pettiness like there is anywhere, it's human nature. But everything is perspective, some adapt and some don't, these are life skills and often say more about the way people deal with things than anything else. \r\n\r\nThe people who don't fit in here are usually the ones who want to make it into something it's not.  \r\n\r\nA lot of the cons mentioned vary from department to department so some of them may be considered to be fair and valid. Areas that are continuously being improved include: On Board Training, Processes, Progression opportunities, Incentives, Recognition along with all the incredible perks that come with working here\r\n\r\nLike any place you work, you have to earn your stripes and some people seem to lose patience after a few weeks or a month or two if it doesn't happen for them that quickly. Hard work is rewarded if people listen to the advice given to them and learn from it, some people would rather just blame others for their lack of ability to deliver, than acknowledge their own shortcomings  \r\n\r\nPlease don't think my own experiences here haven't been tested. I have had huge issues with staff and management at times, but we've worked through them and grown all the better for it both as people and professionals.  This is because they are human beings that try to understand your perspective and if you extend them the same courtesy, it tends to end productively and with reasonable solutions and lessons learnt. \r\n\r\nIt's a company, a company which has grown very quickly and tried to incorporate many different perspectives into the mix, sometimes this means you'll have to fight to have your perspective listened to, but if you do it with a little common sense and patience, management will give you respect and talk to you like an adult (This has not been common in most places I've worked)\r\n\r\nThe transparency here does tend to fluctuate, knowing where to draw the line these days with this is difficult to handle. But things are continuously being improved, If they weren't, I wouldn't be here. \r\n\r\nAll I can tell you is I have worked in a lot of autocratic style call centres with very toxic environments, If I got the slightest inclination I was working somewhere which was becoming like that? I would be the first one out the door, trust me\r\n\r\nSome people have obviously had very sheltered lives and expect companies to be completely perfect. Not sure where they've worked before, but if they think this place is bad? I can't see the future being particularly bright for them\r\n\r\nIt's human nature to complain, there's always stuff to bicker about, but once again, to summarise, my worst day here, is better than any other place I've worked. If people are getting that angry, the majority of it will be self inflicted \r\n\r\nAs for the drug culture, whilst I could be objective and acknowledge it is a very relaxed company, I've never seen anything obtrusive, overt, offensive or disrespectful to others. Whilst some complaints may be fair and legitimate, I'd say a lot of them are opportunistic and once again coming from a place of bitterness and intolerance."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great company, growing in the right direction", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Career Consultant in Hove, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free fruit, beer fridge, office massages and a friendly atmosphere are all things I loved whilst working here.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I was leaving they were going through a large period of growth, and are investing a lot into making sure this is done properly.
