They had doors allowing you to enter their buildings and rooms.\r\n\r\n2. You get paid.\r\n\r\n3. They had windows in their offices', albeit they were old.", "cons": "Having worked in the Data Solutions team within the IT department on a fixed-term contract, it was, on balance a more negative than positive experience. It is worth fleshing out why this is the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When my contract ended and I requested a referee for my new job, a former colleague refused, alleging he had no time for this. This was roundly inconsistent with him not only being a referee for at least one other former colleague, but also writing several recommendations for him on business-oriented websites! It is more likely than not he did have time but bizarrely acted improperly with his mendacity.\r\n\r\n2. About a year before my contract expired, one in charge of data solutions promised the year before he would furnish lots of notice should my contract not be extended. However, I was appalled that he gave just over two months notice period despite admitting that he was cognisant MONTHS before that my contract wouldn't be extended or made permanent! This made me feel misled, undervalued and upset, wherefore I was left battling to find work to avoid the mortification and difficulties of unemployment, during the impending Brexit vote - a difficult economic period that saw employers put the brakes on hiring while consumer and business confidence was dampening. I was trapped in unemployment for NEARLY A YEAR,  consequently impairing my economic situation, escalating family and personal worries, producing an IRREVOCABLE dark hole in my career history which damaged my reputation among employers and agencies to thereby make me less employable, and making me feel stupid, especially given he KNEW the probability of securing employment would've been higher had sufficient notice been given.  He had no decency to even apologise for his breech of promise.  Also, HR's policy said employees are to be notified 6 months in advance if contracts would not be extended. However, they failed to abide by this instead giving me a few months notice! Yet, they want employees to carefully adhere to policies, which is pure inconsistency.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. He secretly told a colleague he did an illegality whereafter making this easy to detect to the team! How flippant and heedless for him to plough ahead with this! Action was taken against him, which hopefully made it less likely this will be repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. It was blindingly puzzling and unbecoming that my past manager infracted license agreements after admitting this to the team in such a heedless, imprudent manner! How on earth is it sensible to disclose something like that, especially so casually and nonchalantly, rather than putting things right?\r\n\r\n\r\n5. I was very surprised he did not delegate work for nearly two months when I first joined the team! Instead, he put me on a training course, despite the fact I didn't need it. This gave me the inkling I was not needed in the team, didn't deserve to be paid plus it decelerated the pace of gaining experience in real-world project and the sector. What was bizarre was that a colleague didn't need the training he was placed on to enjoy professional development, as he had decades of experience and was closer to the end of his career than beginning! By contrast, I required this, but instead was put on courses which did not expand my professional competencies vis-a-vis to what I expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Meetings led by the one in charge of data-related solutions almost always overshot, sometimes taking half an hour longer than scheduled! Furthermore, the manager would sometimes socialise with colleagues, talking about housing, pensions, etc. despite the deadlines we had, ergo,the amount of time lost down to such mediocre  timekeeping was disappointing and counterproductive. Also, I would be sometimes interrupted when speaking in meetings, which I found impertinent.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. I was disappointed the one managing data-related solutions, more often than not, assigned me the most boring and simplest work despite knowing my prowess and zeal to aim higher. I felt he had little confidence in me for no warranted reason, which explains why he gave me such work which was frankly, child's-play. It was hardly contributive to the department, and certainly less comprehensive than what the job specification said.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. I never really felt part of the team as everyone else would speak to one another and just ignore me. I felt isolated especially during meetings when sometimes, no-one would even look at me!\r\n\r\n\r\n9. On the floor wherein I worked, it was almost always chilly as they had no sense in fixing the heaters! It was because of this that a colleague suggested I leave the country and emigrate to a warmer one! How disrespectful!\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Within the office I worked in, people spoke too much especially about silly, irrelevant matters i.e. sex, hobbies, etc. and didn't carry out more work than what could've been done despite time constraints for deliverables. I believe the culture should be more formal to consistently achieve the same results and make effective utilisation of time, something which cannot be regained once lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, especially the first few enumerated, overall, I regret not leaving King's a lot sooner than I did.

You see, KCL relies heavily on temping staff, many of whom are kept on temp contracts for years despite doing a full-time, permanent role. This means that they can be \u2018let go\u2019 of quickly and with no questions asked. I spent about 2 months here, and despite picking up the very job quickly and getting good feedback from senior staff, I received a phone call one evening at 5.10 and told not to come in again. No explanation was given for this, and they then ignored my phone calls and emails. Though some of the academic staff here are quite nice, the administrative team were vile \u2013 gossipy, rude and unfriendly. For example, I was placed with a \u2018colleague\u2019 who made no secret of the fact she resented my presence for some reason, snapping at me whenever I asked for help or advice. She then began ignoring me when I said \u2018good morning\u2019 and \u2018goodbye\u2019, completely blanking me for weeks for no reason. The exceptions to this were when other staff members were present, when she spent some time badmouthing other staff behind their backs. This sort of behaviour seemed entirely normal for this office and though I was only there for 2 months I could really pick up on the level of tension and politics in this place and wasn\u2019t too sorry to leave (though a day\u2019s notice would have been nice). \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for management \u2013 two-faced, spineless and useless, and they really couldn\u2019t care about you as a person. Mine for instance repeatedly got my name wrong, and conveniently was 'working from home' on the day I was fired with no explanation. A real control freak \u2013 she could scarcely hide her irritation that my predecessor had created a to-do document before leaving, seemingly without her knowledge \u2013 she demanded that I email her a copy, then quizzed me on each item one-by-one in a highly patronising manner at our weekly catch-up meetings. Ironically I was working for the mental health studies team, and my placement coincided with KCL making a big huzzah about improving staff mental health and wellbeing. Utterly shameless hypocrites. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the office itself, KCL has some good locations in central London, however it\u2019s clear that the Denmark Hill campus is the poor relation. After years working in Central London I quite liked the peace and quiet, however the buildings themselves are hideous 70s time-warps desperately in need of renovation and decoration \u2013 think unwashed dishes left in sinks for weeks, stained carpets, 10 year old safety posters stuck up with yellowing sellotape etc. \u2013 a real dump. The exceptions to this are the reception and some of the ground floor areas visitors might see. Maybe KCL could take some of that money they\u2019re spending on buying up central London property and spruce up the DH campus as frankly it\u2019s an embarrassment. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the job itself \u2013 boring, tedious, dead-end - a living lesson in Parkinson\u2019s Law. At KCL every possible admin process has its own separate IT system with separate login and getting anything done involves jumping through about 5 different hoops. For example, my phone didn\u2019t work properly so I asked for new one \u2013 cue a month-long rigmarole being passed around 4-5 different departments, at the end of which I still didn\u2019t have a new phone \u2013 in the end I just gave up.
