It was the worst job I've ever had. I've worked in four countries, and this was the worst managed university I've ever seen. Let's break things down: 1. There is no contingency planning. Hell, there's no PLANNING. You will be asked to do a massive task with a day's notice, with no prior discussion. There will be people who will be off sick, and you'll be asked to step in to a brand new role for a LONG time with no changes to your other duties. 2. Rewards are unconnected to actual tasks of the role. Be the best teacher you can be, winning awards and students emailing upper management, be the best researcher and publish in Nature, and you will not be promoted. Instead, someone with a lower research profile than you will because they agreed to shoot their weekends in the face by taking a role no one wants. If you win a grant, it will be not enough because it's not big enough, or worse, it's not the right kind. 3. You WILL work on the weekends. See planning. 4. Teaching is weird compared to other universities. In most of the other russell group universities, you don't mark students at the first and second year level. Here, ALL marking must be done by people with PhDs- even if outside of the subject. I taught cognition, and I had a neurologist marking my students. Marking is heavy in load, and has unrealistic requirements or the time. The teaching support is non-existent. Teaching assistants are basically sparse and have no duties, and are deeply underpaid with weird limits. You are asked to make massive changes to teaching within days because they're so disorganised. 5. If you complain about something, management will do EVERYTHING they can to make it a problem that is because of YOU. Not because of situation or the lack of support. 6. Research. Your research time is NOT protected time. You will not be given time to research anything even if your grant has given you \"bought out\" time. Why? Because they'll give you unrealistic expectation in other areas. Not only that, the University takes the LARGEST overhead of grants I've ever seen. So, there's greed there too. 7. Admin. Jesus. The ADMIN. Everything is done in duplicate at minimum. Marking? You have to log the results once for those on time, again for the lates, again for the supplemental exam. Research? You have to do ethics twice. Grants? Twice. 8. management. There are have been three heads of school of psychology in my time. The first was amazing. He always worked for us, and we got the sense he was always working with us. The next one was horrendous, basically evil. The newest one is a person who wants so badly to be a buisness man without the business training. From my conversations with my team, he uses words like \"revenue raising\" and \"the work you're paid to\" without understanding business decisions from an evidence based perspective. He seems to lack self awareness; one team member told me they talked to him, and he didn't seem to be aware that he had a negative reputation in the staff for a lot of his decisions. Many staff members have left, and he doesn't seem to realise WHY. Now, the first school head DID make some unpopular decisions, but it was well justified and negotiated. This one makes it a personal problem that YOU have rather than anything else. 9. Social groups. The department is split across two buildings on opposite ends of the campus. There are no social groups whatsoever to compensate. There are no department parties, discussion groups, research groups, except in some labs. People are friendly BUT they are overworked and have no incidental contact, meaning you will be alone a lot of the time. 10. Staff attrition. The best people who can leave, do. Four left to the US in 2022, and by my count, at least 3 others left to other places. None left with much warning. They were so sick of it they left suddenly, as much as we liked them. There was no goodbye party for them either. 11. Pay. The staff have been striking for five years for better pay and working conditions, with pensions also at stake. If you came in the past 5 years, and had a yearly increase as part of your contract, you went backwards in pay due to inflation. In real terms, you have lost 17% of your salary, with a tax increase of 1% on top of that. But the university has the money. They made over a billion during the pandemic as profit, and yet, the staff didn't see that money. Finally, Birmingham itself is a depressing city too. It is a city in desperate need of revitalisation. It's close to London but the trains are so expensive. Don't go here. If you can go elsewhere, go."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Old fashioned", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Business engagement officer in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you get a permanent position the pay increases every year are good.", "cons": "A very old fashioned company.

Most of us were elderly, carrying heavy loads around the building, working in hot temps - autoclaves were at 121c, Carry and sort clean out heavy hot metal cans full of waste, where we had to stand over them and breath in the \"sterilised fumes\" - Disgusting and so dangerous. Constant standing on some activities for long periods, repetitive tasks to the point where you would feel sore - no one from management really cared when anyone brought up the concerning work, workload or demeaning behaviour of a manager who made it feel like you weren't doing enough.  After a full day of grafting, the last 30 mins is when the manager would come and \"help you out\" so you do more, most days I went home and felt like not going back and went straight to bed due to back pain. Supervisor - wow, what a joke, left you to it, never around, was meant to be working with you but always on jollies, always pretending to be somewhere, doing something, could never be found and never gets caught - no one from management believes you when you express this. Colleagues are friendly and even great! Accept one, who doesn't look like she'll leave any time soon, bossy and takes all the credit for everything - very political and confrontational, made work a nightmare for some of the other colleagues.
