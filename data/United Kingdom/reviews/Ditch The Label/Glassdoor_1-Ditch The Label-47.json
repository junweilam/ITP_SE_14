He talks down to all of his staff, humiliates them in the office and in meetings, talks badly about his staff (past and present) in front of other colleagues and then claims that is was merely 'banter'. As someone running an anti-bullying charity, you would think he would be aware that he is causing offence. Many staff have left in tears and not returned to the workplace. Staff that have left are then talked about in the most unprofessional manner in front of present staff (and many an untruth said about them - stealing, lying, incapable at work etc).\r\n\r\n- The staff are EVER changing for such a small team. No one can stand the work environment here for too long and many leave in tears (like myself) and suffer from such stress and fear, induced from this poisonous work environment they have to get signed off of work. \r\n\r\n- Expect ZERO training for your role (even if it says full training is offered when you apply) and then to be thrown in at the deep end, if you can't swim, expect to be humiliated.\r\n\r\n- You can work as hard as you can here - really give it your all - and it won't be appreciated. The hours are 9.30am - 6pm, yet you will be judged and made to feel bad for leaving at 6pm, even though the CEO swans in and out when he wants - goes for spray tans, cosmetic surgery, hair cuts, eyebrow threading during work hours whenever he wants and to be honest, while the team are working hard he will sit there taking selfies, strutting around the office topless asking if his muscles are bigger or if he is 'tanned for the gods' (you couldn't write it down the things that go on here are so ridiculous). You have 30mins for lunch although a lot of the time you end up eating over your computer at the desk because god forbid you are gone for 20mins he starts talking badly about you to other members of staff and asking where you are.\r\n\r\n- The charity is a complete vanity project on the CEO's behalf. They claim to help thousands of people each month, but really this is calculated merely on website hits. The values of this charity have been lost somewhere along the way - the main interest here seems to be to get as much publicity as possible for the CEO who sees himself as some sort of celebrity. \r\n\r\n- The 'HR' department consists of one woman, who is the CEO's best friend and now the deputy CEO  - any feedback or grievance given to her is fed straight back to the CEO, not an ounce of confidentiality exists here so you really have no one to turn to. These two are quite an awful duo - they talk badly about the staff, they back up each other's ridiculous and totally unprofessional behaviour.\r\n\r\n- Expect to do a lot of the CEO's work for him while he takes credit for your ideas because 'he can'."}], []]
