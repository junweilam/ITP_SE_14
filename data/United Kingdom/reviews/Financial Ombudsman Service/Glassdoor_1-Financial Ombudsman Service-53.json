First of all, I was hired with almost 10 years of experience in complaint handling, compliance, and financial products. I had everything going for me except the experience in the product I was chosen to \u201cspecialise\u201d in. The 6 month academy starts with live cases on day 3, meaning you are introducing yourselves to unassuming consumers acting as if you are a specialist, when you have barely got your head around the language needed to discuss the technicalities of the product in question. Academy mentors are from the old FOS, and many of them worked their way up from more menial admin roles, so they have no experience in finance outside the walls of the ombudsman. Their advice is non-committal, and their feedback is often misguided. On countless occasions my gut told me this, and it would come out later our findings on the case in question hadn\u2019t been in line with FCA regulation or our previous approach, despite seeking guidance every step of the way. They are pushing any answer out the door and hoping savvy consumers and businesses won\u2019t object. The targets in the academy would be more than achievable with the right product based training, but without this, my entire time spent there felt like a bad dream where I had an exam on a book I hadn\u2019t read. Myself and many others asked for more support and training, and we were assured we would receive this, or we had already had it, or we should have more faith in our decision making skills. At least 6 people left my cohort in the first 3 months. We were working evenings and weekends in our own time to try and make progress, people were crying at their desks, and still no meaningful changes were made. I had to admit that I was on the verge of a breakdown to get any sort of help, but I was so broken from this experience I just had to get out. I am a balanced person, and I was confident in my abilities when I walked through those doors. Being gaslit by my manager for months truly left me an anxious wreck, unable to see a way out. I should have looked into the findings of the Dispatches documentary before taking a job at FOS. They might have tweaked a few aspects of the role and training since 2018, but the general mismanagement, absolute negligence, and misuse of money is still at the heart of FOS. The enquiry that was conducted shortly after the documentary was not a true reflection of the service (for so many reasons that I don\u2019t have time to go into here).

Extremely poor when compared with other similar organisations in London in particular. This has been compounded by a measly 2.5% pay-rise this year following a wholly unjustifiable pay-freeze the year before. An utter slap in the face for the hard-working staff here given the rampant inflation and wider economic climate in the UK at the moment. \r\n\r\n* The pay scales are unfair. For Investigators it's ludicrous, with the salary jumping up in miniscule increments between levels, despite the workload and target requirements increasing fairly drastically. The jump up from L3 to SI is significant in terms of responsibilities but the pay-rise is equally microscopic. They need to review the bandings and make adjustments as there is little reason for people to push themselves onto the next level. \r\n\r\n* The best people are leaving in droves and the ongoing brain-drain over the last several years has really started to tell. Anyone really good that joins the service quickly realises their error and scarpers off to pastures greener elsewhere, normally to progress their careers with more influential and prestigious organisations (the FCA being a particularly popular destination). The organisation is now reliant on a precious few highly-skilled OMs to make key decisions on policy, and these staff members are generally poorly treated and stretched to near breaking point with the plethora of other responsibilities they juggle. It's unsustainable. \r\n\r\n* Conversely, there's not enough attrition at the OM and OL position. There are some extremely unimpressive figures in these roles (anyone working here for a while will no doubt have a few names in mind) that have been clinging on for dear life for several years, meaning highly talented and more qualified staff in junior positions have been unable to progress upwards, causing them to look for opportunities elsewhere. I understand many SIs have already left or are heading for the exits at pace because of the lack of progression opportunities into the OM role. \r\n\r\n* The Investigations model has been a disaster from start to finish. It has caused untold stress and unhappiness for so many people here and made a functioning service far, far worse. \r\n\r\n* A new operational model is being worked on and will be released at some nebulous point in the distant future, but staff have little confidence that leadership will get this right. There has been next to no communication on what to expect from this new model, when it will actually happen, and how that will affect people's jobs. Will SIs be turned into a pack of dejected, myopic line managers? Will OMs need to apply for a new Ombudsman position? Will Investigators be given an extra 10 cases to close per quarter? Will the unfairly forgotten-about and oft-mistreated SAs become full time service complaint responders, churning out begrudging apology after begrudging apology to a litany of irked and irate consumers? Who knows? Certainly not I. \r\n\r\n* Staff are demotivated. People simply don't take pleasure in the job anymore and staff surveys have shown that pride in what we do has plummeted. The root cause for this is the relentless pressure and stretching of people to breaking point. Pressure to hit target numbers week in, week out, has made what could have been an interesting and meaningful job into a numbers game. We can thank PWC for this, whose impact at FOS can be likened to that scene from Glengarry Glen Ross where a risible, corporate Alec Baldwin lectures and emasculates a team of hapless salesmen about their various ineptitudes; explaining that they either achieve impossible goals or they hit the bricks. Though saying that, at least Alec Baldwin's character solicited a few chuckles, whereas nobody was laughing at the FOS as we saw our baffled, moribund CEO hauled before the TSC for a succession of scoldings at the hands of furious MPs appalled at what our Service had become. \r\n\r\n* The systems used are generally terrible and not fit for purpose. Phoenix, the case handling software built within an unsuitable Microsoft framework, is clunky, confusing and complicated. Clipper, the previous iteration, was vastly superior in nearly every way. PowerBI has been more effective and is a useful tool, but still has its issues (try filtering for cases by a specific operational warning for an example) and the decision to not allow data from PowerBI to be extracted onto a spreadsheet is truly maddening. \r\n\r\n* I could honestly keep rabbiting on. I haven't even talked about the huge queues, the unworkable and unrealistic service standards, the phone shift scandal, the failures of senior leadership, the poor training, the unfair treatment of staff in the ASA, the lack of R and R for those that routinely go above and beyond etc etc. but I'll stop here as you're probably as bored of reading this review as I have been living the reality."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Fine", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "4 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Ombudsman Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Pays the bills Worse out there!", "cons": "It\u2019s all been said before"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Low pay, diminishing opportunities, unaware CEO", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "5 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Investigator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance is good, and there is plenty of opportunity to get involved in varied and interesting work.\r\n\r\nGreat place for a first-time job for the above reasons.

The seriousness of some of the issues the organisation deals with every day cannot be understated.", "cons": "I have worked at the service for many years but right now is its most challenging iteration - no mean feat when you look back over a checkered history. Being an Ombudsman Manager is a thankless task. The outside world perhaps has no idea of the scope of the role - the OM has a decision target for the cases they must resolve, they line manage Investigators that are experiencing varying degrees of burnout and disillusionment. This is often more involved than being the point of contact for one to ones etc- if there are capability or disciplinary issues, the OM is expected to lead on supporting and investigating on those matters - a full time job in and of itself. In addition to this, if a complainant raises concerns about the level of service they have received, the OM has to down tools and respond. The OM is also required to undertake quality checks and if they have a particular interest in an area of casework, they also have to find the time to keep abreast of technical developments in an ever changing financial world as well as being on hand on demand to provide support to Investigators that are struggling with cases that are ever more complex. \r\n\r\nIt is a vast role and the level of renumeration does not fairly reflect the amount of work that is done after hours to keep afloat. It's also not a level playing field because of the amount of people that are choosing to work after hours and distorting what it is possible to achieve in regular working hours. To those people I would say no matter what you do, it's never enough. \r\n\r\nThere has been much talk for a very long time about the organisation of the future, but it lacks any detail. It is unclear whether people will have to reapply for redesigned posts at a later stage. Communication on the issues that matter is either non existent or tone deaf. When staff raised concerns that the current pay review/banding structure is inconsistent and demotivating (there's a pay band for each level but it is impossible to progress in the pay band so you are always at the entry point no matter what) the response given was that people don't work for the service for the money. Point taken but staff used to be treated fairly and the seriousness of the decisions we were making about people's financial affairs was historically recognised by both the connection to the judicial scale and a performance related pay. The benefits package is not as competitive as they think it is. There is little to no investment in professional development for experienced staff. \r\n\r\nThe mistakes of the last six years linger and for all the change there's been at the top, on a day to day basis nothing has actually changed for the people still doing the work - if anything, there is more pressure now very senior staff are going through cases one by one and demanding to know why they have not been resolved. There is no trust that your staff are in control and know what they are doing and there is no recognition that some cases are complex and will take longer and that's not an issue because the parties to the complaint understand that. Language used by OLs is negative and punitive - no exceptions, no excuses. There's no recognition that people that are doing their best after many years of uncertainty, putting aside a global pandemic and a cost of living crisis. Reward and recognition for team building and motivation is either conspicuous by its absence or so trite its offensive. \r\n\r\nI would think twice before accepting a job role in this environment. There is better out there- colleagues that have moved on to other organisations have commented on a vast improvement to their physical and mental health.

Opportunity to develop a specialist area, learning a lot about a certain financial product, although you don't always get a say in what to specialise in.\r\n\r\nMost of the time you get a lot of autonomy in your work (exceptions listed below).\r\n\r\nGood internal sources for learning about different financial products, and lots of support available if you are dealing with a tricky case.\r\n\r\nClear path for progression within the investigator role; however, it's a difficult leap from investigator to senior investigator/ombudsman. Possibility of going part time. Performance related annual bonus - from \u00a32k if you're meeting expectations and almost \u00a35k if you're significantly exceeding them. The starting salary for investigators is about \u00a329k but that can go up to \u00a345k in around 3 years if you keep exceeding the targets - but heads up, targets are hard. You can also opt to increase your targets for extra pay. Sometimes management go out of their way to recognise your work, e.g. a \u00a3500 bonus to everyone during covid, and I was once sent a big box of biscuits at Christmas.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, management were reasonable and understanding, but many colleagues have some horror stories about cruel managers. That said, HR must be doing something right because the vast majority of investigators are great people, always lovely to work with, and more experienced investigators routinely go out of their way to help you in spite of their own workload. I think many of the Ombudsman Managers (your direct manager, if you're an investigator) are also great, but the further up the management ladder you go, the more purely rotten people you find. Personally, I always attributed difficulties with OMs to the pressure they're under from senior management.", "cons": "There is a strong focus on targets, so the workload can be challenging, but targets don't take into account that some cases require much more work than others. You will eventually adjust to strategically planning your caseload to meet each quarter's targets, but that shouldn't be necessary in the first place. You will end up working longer than you are paid for to meet targets.\r\n\r\nThe customer service standards are largely performative, and show that management don't trust investigators to use their initiative. There is a strong focus on making phone calls (especially when delivering an outcome on a case) as much as possible. I've had many cases where this just didn't make sense, for example, if you're dealing with a particularly complex case, it might be best to send your findings in writing first and ask the consumer to give you a call once they've read your report - yet doing this has lost me points in customer service checks, as we are supposed to call first and then send our findings. It's like investigators are punished for not acting like cogs in a machine. Additionally, a lot of the phone calls are tricky - even when you're giving a consumer the answer they want, they often find something to be upset about. I've had some downright abusive calls (although you're never expected to take abuse), and sometimes it's depressing when you feel like, despite all your hard work, you just can't please anyone - this is a feeling you will sadly have to get used to.\r\n\r\nThere was talk of this changing, but when I was there (a year ago), all investigators had to answer the general helpline for approx 3 hours a week. On phone shifts, there are many queries that you won't be qualified to answer and many more that could easily be dealt with by a dedicated customer service team. Since each investigator develops a specialist area, this seems like a waste of each investigator's expertise. There are many ways that phone shifts could be organised more efficiently to take advantage of each staff member's specialist knowledge; eg. I could answer many questions about certain types of insurance, but I know very little about credit agreements. On that note, although everyone has a specialist area, investigators are still expected to take on a few more general basic cases - personally I would prefer if all cases were delegated to whomever can deal with them best. If a banking specialist has to deal with a basic insurance case, and an insurance specialist has to deal with a basic banking case, why not let them swap?\r\n\r\nFinally, I think many potential employees are enticed by the job title \"investigator,\" thinking it will open a lot of doors later on. It's certainly an interesting job, but in my experience, quite a number of future employers just see it as a complaint handling job - not to mention that many financial institutions don't exactly love the FOS (although I imagine some see it as advantageous to have a former FOS employee on board). Don't get me wrong, you'll learn a lot in the job and it helped me break into the legal profession, but the job primarily qualifies you to do customer relations/ complaints jobs - not finance jobs. If you're early in your career/a graduate/a customer service professional, the investigator job could be great, but if you're more experienced, I don't think it's going to serve as a stepping stone into investment banking or anything like that. Many investigators move on to work at the FCA, and an impressive number go on to consulting work (eg PwC). I suppose it comes down to how you portray the job on your CV - there are many aspects to it, so it can be pretty versatile and applicable to a lot of other jobs."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor pay for the city and a dilute role with a lack of focus", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Investigator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working at the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) gave me both great insight into the spectacular ways financial products can go wrong, how petty the general public can be and how to manage such insights in such a mediocre way from an organisational stand point, that it doesn\u2019t matter if the investigators and ombudsman are exceptional at their job the process can get in the way.\r\n FOS exists to informally resolve complaints about financial products as an alternative to the courts. \r\nAs an investigator, your role is to make complaint resolution cheaper for the FOS as investigators cost half as much as an ombudsman in salary. You handle all the chaff and anyone who disagrees with your answer gets their case referred to an ombudsman (in about 3 to 9 months time).\r\nWhat\u2019s good about the role\r\n\u2022\t35 hour work week\r\n\u2022\tNice office (However it\u2019s a bit too loud a times due to being open plan)\r\n\u2022\t25 days annual leave, 8 bank holidays and unofficial bonus day at Christmas\r\n\u2022\tOT for investigators was \u00a3250 a case and for Ombudsman it was \u00a3100.", "cons": "What\u2019s bad about the role?\r\nThe issue with the investigator job is that the FOS doesn\u2019t seem to know what they want them to be good at. The core of the investigator role is to assess evidence (usually in the form of testimony and financial documents) from complainants and financial businesses and determine if a financial business has correctly applied its terms and conditions and done it in a fair way. Then write a report on this matter and communicate it to both parties, then if either party disagrees with what you have to say (after trying to convince them you\u2019re right) the complaint will then be referred to an ombudsman (3-9 month wait).\r\nHowever due to some questionable business decision upper management seems to be determined to dilute this role as much as possible. Examples include the following.\r\nHaving investigators man the phone lines for at least three hours a week. \r\nOriginally this was envisioned as a way for investigators to organically pick up new complaints. In reality this hardly ever happened because not every call is a new complaint (most weren\u2019t). And a lot of the complaints that did come in could only be worked by specific departments.\r\nSo for three hours a week (more like four or five if you include prep time before the calls, and any phone call that goes past your specific hour) you are acting as a customer service agent rather than an investigator not picking up new cases and not progressing current cases.\r\nWhile working a case Internal service standards ask you update complainants every two weeks.\r\nThis seems fine theory but in reality when you\u2019re juggling between 30 and 80 cases that\u2019s a lot of admin for not a lot of gain (the update is generally just to assure them we haven\u2019t forgotten about their complaint with no meaningful update content) . This also creates a death spiral of work where the more cases you have the more time you need to spend updating the complainants which means you have less time for work. Five minutes times thirty is two and a half hours every two weeks keeping the minimum case load of people updated. It\u2019s important to let people know what going on but this particular method seems like a waste of time. I\u2019d personally increase this working standard to a minimum of four weeks (but ideally six).\r\nAfter the case has been referred to an ombudsman you\u2019re still responsible for its admin(So now you\u2019re also a secretary)\r\nAfter either side has asked for an ombudsman to review the case the investigator is still responsible for the day to day admin on the complaint. At this point I have nothing more meaningful to add to the case yet I\u2019m still required to handle calls and emails for the complainant. When an ombudsman wants to ask a question to either side they don\u2019t email them directly (I have no idea why) but instead write a draft email and ask that I send it from my account. I just don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t have a business admin department to do this instead.\r\nAdditional issues\r\nPoor focus on what they want an investigator to do with a number of tasks being required that don\u2019t contribute to their performance target.\r\nPoor IT systems \u2013 They use an altered version of Powered BI. Which clunky email integration and poor case management systems.\r\nSome archaic HR policies \u2013 They use the Bradford factor for sick leave which is fairly regressive. You can\u2019t just email that you\u2019re sick you need to call in for some unspecified reason and then management will ask you about symptoms ect.\r\nFairly anti union \u2013 The FOS as its own internal ICC council which is prefers to use to handle workforce matters. This to me seems like an attempt to circumvent any force a union might exert on the organisation. \r\nI spoke to the Unite union rep once and asked how things worked when they what to deal with union issues. E.g if you need to speak to an employee who has a union issue between (let\u2019s just say) 4pm and 5pm does she get this time back. She explained that places with good union relationships generally give this time back in accrued annual leave. So if over a month you spend three and a half hours handling union issues work would give you a half day off. However FOS doesn\u2019t do this which I think shows how weak union power is there.\r\nPoor pay\r\nStarting investigator salary is \u00a328,600. This really isn\u2019t enough to live off in London. Certainly not to live on your own.\r\nNeedless pay freeze\r\nAnd last year (April 2021) they announced a pay freeze \u2013 Not because organisation couldn\u2019t afford it (They had a record number of complaints in the system) but because (In their words) they needed to seem financially frugal when the economy was going through hard times).\r\nThis was despite the fact they have everyone a \u00a3500 bonus work WFH during the pandemic.\r\nThis is important to understand as they effectively traded a permanent salary increase what would have compounded year on year with a one off bonus. This roughly equates to a minimum level investigator being \u00a310,000 less well off over the course of ten years, \u00a315,000 for a senior investigators and \u00a320,000 for a new to role ombudsman.\r\nHaving to work at a roles level (without corresponding pay) to get that promotion \r\nBeing promoted to the next level of investigator requires you to have been working at that investigator level for at least three months.

It's like a Hollywood film that has a good score but poor actors to implement what is written down. \n\nPoor handling of a recent redundancy programme which included a rather spurious revision of the adjudicator salary scale leading to the exit of some experienced and productive staff. Some of these had valuable knowledge in so called 'complex' areas - in reality the Service has always dealt with these cases but it seems to be now spinning the concept as something new that is a hindrance and affecting its back logs of work. Lack of recognition for departing staff too. A bit swept of a let's sweep it under the the carpet approach to the redundancy. \n\nThe quality of case investigations could be better. A review of provisional decisions by ombudsman would likely show this. \n\nThe Service's quality function seems to have gone backwards, a relatively recent report recommended a stand alone QA area but it hasn't gone along with this recommendation.

This has led to a \"new way of working\" which means that closing complaints is treated more like hitting sales targets, rather than case handlers taking the time necessary to understand consumers' complaints and reaching fair outcomes. Many of the appointments to the \"new roles\" under the \"investigation\" model seem to have been given to people who are lacking in genuine critical thinking skills and lacking in technical expertise (or the aptitude to learn the necessary expertise), but are instead the sort of people who can talk well without knowing what they're talking about and, in some cases, can't even write competently. Consequently, the environment has become more like a sales arena, rather than a professional dispute resolution service - where poor quality investigative work is overlooked in favour of people meeting or exceeding their productivity targets.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the \"investigation\" model is financially unsustainable - costing more per case than the \"old\" way of working. Many cases are also taking longer, on average, to be completed than prior to the changes. This means that the new model is failing on its fundamental objectives.\r\n\r\nThere are elements of poor management - both at middle-management level and senior-management level. Whilst the Financial Ombudsman Service proclaims to encourage openness and honesty, the culture is somewhat to suppress dissenting voices and discourage people from speaking up. Fundamental changes need to be made to the way the organisation views its employees - and this needs to be directed from the executive team, fed through to its very large HR department, and down through the senior management and middle managers.

Furthermore, they say they offer flexible working. This is a complete lie! If you\u2019re working from home, they\u2019ll monitor your activity and if for some reason you\u2019re away for more than 15 minutes, you\u2019re manager will call you and ask why.

There was even an incidence where one of my colleagues was recovering from surgery feeling compelled to meet targets or risk losing his job.\r\n\r\nDuring lockdown I told HR and my managers that I had look after my daughter alongside work so am unable to do phone shifts.

This is essentially to scare you into working longer, unpaid hours until you meet their targets. I feel especially sorry for those who were tricked into joining the service on the basis that the job was advertised as investigating financial claims etc. This is nothing but a call centre job.

Here are a few of the reasons why this is a great place:\r\n* Excellent work / life balance.\r\n* Lovely colleagues make a very nice atmosphere to work in.\r\n* We do important work, help people and have the opportunity to make a difference.\r\n* Often stimulating and challenging work.\r\n* Great location (near Canary Wharf).\r\n* Great office building.\r\n* Subsidised canteen.\r\n* Great benefits, including BUPA health coverage.\r\n* Good pension scheme.\r\nIt's just such a terrible shame about all the stuff I've had to write about below. This used to be my dream job.", "cons": "* Massively ill-conceived and poorly-implemented restructuring of the organisation.\r\n* Total disdain for financial and technical knowledge, expertise and experience.\r\n* New business model in which everyone is expected to be a \"jack of all trades and master of none.\"\r\n* Micro-managing of investigators, instead of trusting them to do their jobs like adults.\r\n* Low morale as a result of all the above.\r\n* Exclusively white and male executive team (apart from the CEO, who has surrounded herself with yes-men) who refuse to listen to feedback from their staff. Consequently the only way people can say what they think is here, on Glass Door. That's no way to run an organisation.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, in order to save money (somehow), we are replacing the old system in which people specialised in certain areas -- pensions, investments, mortgages, banking and consumer credit, insurance etc -- with a new system of \"multi-skilling\" in which no-one is expected (or realistically able) to know much about anything, and will have to deal with every single kind of complaint about any kind of product. This totally devalues specialist knowledge. Yes, we make decisions which are \"fair and reasonable,\" but we also still have to have regard for relevant laws and regulations as well, and there are too many of those for someone to know them all.\r\n\r\nThis new way of working was piloted, but then was rolled out Service-wide before even waiting for the pilot to finish! That proves the trials were a sham all along -- they were always going to force this through no matter what.\r\n\r\nAlso, the most experienced people are being driven out of the service by pay caps which are blatantly designed to force the best people out (I'm referring to grade 2 ombudsmen, the backbone of the Service -- now try to imagine an army with no sergeants). Soon there will not be enough good people to salvage the Service from this godawful mess once the Board wake up and realise the catastrophe we are hurtling towards.\r\n\r\nWe are sacrificing quality and integrity in the service we provide, and jeopardising the credibility and reputation of a once wonderful -- and still very important -- dispute resolution service which gives people the opportunity to sort out serious problems without having to go through the expense and time of litigation.\r\n\r\nPeople are being forced to apply for jobs they don't want for fear of the consequences of not applying. A notable example: the new combined role of \"ombudsman manager,\" which neither managers nor ombudsmen wanted to do. And then forcing them to micro-manage their investigators instead of letting them adopt the style of management that best suits them.\r\n\r\nAnd I can't imagine that the investigators enjoy being micro-managed in such a condescending way, treating them like children. They used to be trusted, capable adults who were highly-motivated in their roles. Now they're demoralised and who can blame them?\r\n\r\nThe executive team don't want to listen to feedback. When we said \"yes, we understand why change needs to happen\" we did't mean that we agreed with the form the changes have taken, just that we understood that we have to save money somehow. We could break even just by increasing the PPI supplementary fee from zero to \u00a3100. But no, instead we're going to cut the best people's pay and get rid of them instead. Nice one.\r\n\r\nNobody feels that they can voice their dissent, except anonymously on this website. No-one feels valued. Morale has sunk low. Everyone at the coal face is unanimously of the view that this is a terrible idea, but the executive is oblivious and the Board appears not to know or care what is happening. They need to fire Caroline Wayman and all the grade 5 and 6 ombudsmen (who aren't real ombudsmen and who don't understand what the real ombudsmen, adjudicators and investigators do) and bring back Natalie Ceeney or Walter Merricks. They would sort this mess out, and would understand that someone who voices a dissenting opinion isn't a trouble-maker or a malcontent, but just a loyal employee with a love for the Service, an independent mind, and a constructive, well-intentioned alternative opinion.

It seems the colleague uproar and bad press is well known and widespread. \r\n\r\nAlthough I didn't apply for a promotion myself, I did find some odd decisions occur with some truly gifted colleagues of mine being overlooked, with promotions often favoured towards those with no family commitments, existing friendships with leadership or willingness to flirt.

I love what we do and actually, the new world has some very good aspects. But unfortunately, I\u2019ve experienced first hand (as an investigator) that the flaws with the new system are too big to simply ignore. \n\nKnowledge: the answer is in the room. It\u2019s true that someone out there can help you. But what I think was overlooked was that it\u2019s not sustainable for you to not be able to do many cases without asking for help. You should be able to deal with problems because you know how to. Not because someone told you the answer and you don\u2019t know enough to question it. What\u2019s even more insulting is that virtual teams were created to deal with the more complex areas of casework. But there\u2019s no training. I\u2019m part of one and I do what I can dealing with products I\u2019ve no idea about. They go to ombudsman and it gets looked at properly. It\u2019s a great way to ruin staff morale. \n\nQuality vs quantity: without sounding too big headed, I think I have adjusted well to my role and I\u2019m very good at both quality and quantity. But it isn\u2019t sustainable. I\u2019m exhausted. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of colleagues reaching that point too. Once they were positive about difficult cases and the challenges that brings. But now with a focus back on closures through overtime incentives, people just want easy cases. If you\u2019re bringing a complex case or take up too much of an investigator\u2019s time, any old view will do and let\u2019s get it to an ombudsman as soon as we can. Then it isn\u2019t my problem. That is the reality. How do you really expect someone to look at five pension or investment cases per week and close them over the phone?\n\nOmbudsman managers: it\u2019s a sad fact that I would no longer feel confident in bringing my own personal complaint to the ombudsman service. Not because people are horrible here, but because I\u2019ve seen that even ombudsmen are getting things wrong. And would I really want my case looked at by one of them? No. I would pray it goes to a \u201creal\u201d ombudsman who actually knows the product area. I\u2019m not trying to be negative it\u2019s just the reality. I\u2019ve seen it myself. Ombudsman managers think the answer is fair (but you can\u2019t decide that without knowing what to base it on) and so try their best to close cases over the phone. Much better as they can\u2019t get juridically reviewed that way. \n\nIncoming post and phone shifts: we had a few months of overtime because the incoming post was so high. Maybe this is because everyone is already busy enough and you got rid of the department who deal with post? Also phone shifts, they\u2019re scheduled in but you end up doing further shifts through POD cover because there aren\u2019t enough people to answer the phones.

Base knowledge of what fair, decent, acceptable, not okay, look and feel like. Capacity and inclination to properly establish and understand, as best as possible, what happened by knowing (or educated guessing) what lines of enquiry might help shine a light on matters. Assessing things empathetically (towards both sides) but dispassionately, with a common sense hat on. Listening carefully to the evidence presented (including what people remember but can\u2019t back up with a document because life\u2019s not like that). Changing your mind.

Telling your manager to chill - screw timeliness targets, this one needs time. Ignoring ombudsman when they\u2019re wrong (they\u2019re regularly wrong - now more than ever) in order to do the right thing. Telling an ombudsman you disagree if you disagree. Harping on and on about something not right you care about until someone notices (years too late, normally). \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what empowering people means. Encouraging participation in the debate, listening to what they say, and not disregarding their concerns as irrelevant, incorrect, misguided, they\u2019re stupider than me because I\u2019m more important so I don\u2019t care. \r\n\r\nEmpowering people is not two weeks crash course of \u2018this is a sort of complaint dictionary. Search for whatever the complaint is about (which hopefully you\u2019ll just know. Pensions are simple. They\u2019re just savings accounts in a fund or something) Then do what the dictionary says.\u2019 Or say you can\u2019t help because \u2018commercial decision\u2019 wins the fair and reasonable chippie.  Or there\u2019s \u2018we\u2019re not a regulator, so we can\u2019t make a firm (sorry - business) change its systems**\u2019. Or reject whatever thing it was with a paragraph. Bonus points for illiteracy. \u00a3200 for distress and inconvenience, maybe, because maybe that will make it go away? Wait. No. Trouble and upset. Because whereas distress and inconvenience is a recognised legal and regulatory concept an ombudsman can award due to explicit statutory authority backed up by regulatory rules, T&U is another, more revolutionary way of saying the same thing, only it isn\u2019t the same thing, which is better. \r\n\r\nThe \u2018system\u2019 generally favours firms. Mostly, they have cash, know-how, documents and sometimes off-putting (souls-destroying) procedures.  And firms (business - my bad...) are often less than great at accepting they\u2019re at fault. But a jobbie of a complainant who is just a jobbie because they were born one and so remain, without substantive or indeed any basis, make real, normal, decent people wading through oft-thankless drudgery feel sad, or pointless - possibly fearful, if that jobbie is a really nasty one. And high value complaints are capable of shifting the boot firmly onto the other foot - putting businesses under, bankrupting people, messing up lives. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not easy. At all. Sometimes it is (or should be) technical, nuanced, and life-changing. Given that, punch-drunk swings at empowering people by attempting to plough them full of misplaced confidence in their judgement on matters they don\u2019t understand is dereliction of the statutory responsibility FOS holds. It\u2019s also hugely unfair on the individuals being encouraged to deal with things they\u2019re not (or shouldn\u2019t be) comfortable with, based on feeling and intuition they can\u2019t hope to have, because often things aren\u2019t simple, and feeling and intuition aren\u2019t enough.  Being placed in a position where someone tells me their life savings are gone, please help, and I need to figure out what to do when I don\u2019t even comprehend what they\u2019ve just told me. Then I ask my ombudsman manager and they have no clue either, or they think they do but don\u2019t. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I\u2019m being unfair. Perhaps the way I think things should be done is wrong. Perhaps I\u2019m not. Perhaps it\u2019s not. I want to respect and believe in FOS. It is (or should be) more important than I think it knows. I don\u2019t want to see it humiliated on TV, it\u2019s senior management to be summoned to awkwardly circumnavigate straightforward questions which have unequivocal definite factual answers. \r\n\r\nI want to have faith that I can rely on FOS to help me if I ever need it. That faith is gone. Hopefully to return some day. \r\n\r\n**(Note: firms are obliged to take heed of ombudsman determinations when, for example, designing systems, and controls to ensure customers are treated fairly and complaints are responded to appropriately. Also, consider that while FCA rules require an adviser to ensure their recommendation is \u2018suitable\u2019, day in, day out, ombudsmen flesh out what that means on a case by case basis and publish it for the world to see. What this means is that ombudsman determinations regulate firm conduct, not through rules, but through setting expectations based on interpretation and practical application of those rules. Not a regulator. Tell a firm on the receiving end of a decision telling them they\u2019ve been entering into insurance contracts with customers for 15 years without knowing it...)

It mattered not how much she ached or reasoned or tried to make any sense of it. The gatekeepers would aggressively tell her she was not worthy of any recognition no matter how much she tried to show them.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the girl grew very disillusioned and very demoralised by the bleak outlook for her future.

Even if you're hitting your target, or doing more than the average performance there and doing a tonne of stuff on the side, you'll be made to feel you're not doing good enough unless you're literally the top of your department. This will drain any good feeling you got from helping consumers.\r\n\r\nLeading on from those first two points - if you're not performing to the level they want, you'll literally be told to start cutting corners by your manager just to get your closure stats to where they \"should\" be even if it means you start getting cases wrong. They often stick people on \"Performance Plans\" with added stress, without actually doing anything significant with them to improve their performance/quality at all, or any additional support whatsoever. They act like they're doing someone a favour and giving them a tonne of support just by giving them more stress to deal with, without doing anything positive.\r\n\r\nSome team and department management are incapable of appreciating any work you do outside of your main targeted key performance indicator.

They'd rather throw money away hiring expensive contractors and terrible management consultancy firms than actually fix the problems that lead to their high turnover. One of their board members once told us that having such a high turnover was a positive sign for the organisation - and that tells you just about all you need to know about their attitude to how expendable their staff are and how little they care about truly fixing the organisational problems that make staff unhappy.\r\n\r\nThe job can be very stressful and most people will receive little support for it unless you're lucky enough to have one of the few brilliant managers. You'll be made to find your own way of coping unless you're one of the extremely lucky ones to have a good manager. There are far too many ways that the organisation drains the rewarding feeling of the work you do and as a result, a lot of people burn out, sometimes multiple times before leaving, and there is a very high turnover of staff.

I could sometimes feel very proud of my work (but not consistently).", "cons": "I think the biggest problem may be that they just don't value management skills. They recruited internally for ombudsman managers, and went almost entirely for ombudsman. They believed that making a decision was something that couldn't be taught, but that people who had never been a manager could immediately be given staff to manage with minimal support. \r\n\r\nIt's wildly inconsistent. Rules vary from team to team. It's not bad if you have a good manager, but managers change. I had 3 in 6 months at one point. If you get a bad manager then it can be terrible . \r\n\r\nThe organisation cannot admit it is wrong. Which means that when you get a bad manager they will back them up however obviously there is a problem. It's a wider problem, they don't just change rules they deny they have changed them (because that would mean admitting they needed to be improved). Things change constantly but they then act as if they have always been that way - that even applies to guidance they give to financial businesses. You would follow guidance and tell a complainant something, then someone would complain about you and they'd undermine you, say something different and deny you were ever given the original guidance. \r\n\r\nThis is particularly bad as they changed so much. Instead of listening to staff (who provided honest and constructive feedback year after year when surveyed, only to see the same mistakes again) they paid huge amounts to consultants who got them to buy whiteboards so teams could \"huddle\" round them.. Which no one liked or found helpful. They got rid of them as soon as they could. \r\n\r\nI thought their customer service was good. I was genuinely impressed with the thought they would put into, for example, accessibility for disabled consumers. But they never showed any of that compassion to staff. They allowed consumers to be abusive, and did not back staff up. They treated anyone with a disability or health problem terribly. (They are obsessed with standing meetings - I was once at a training even where a heavily pregnant woman and someone with severe back problems nearly got into a fight as they each insisted the other one should take the only chair). They were racist. The number of people taking time of with stress or other induced illness was very high. (The work is not stressful, but feeling undervalued, unsupported and being given no control is). \r\n\r\nYou can wait for months for guidance. Their IT systems were so terrible that they were due to bring the new system online for over 1000 staff on a Monday, and at 5pm on the Friday they changed that to less than 10 staff. They paid for outside trainers to train for the new IT system, but did not explain our jobs so they did not know what we would need to do, and could not understand any of our questions. And got them to do it while the software was still in development so by the time it was due to be rolled out it had changed beyond all recognition. And there was no budget or time left to train us in it. Instead of sitting down with expensive trainers for 2 half day sessions in computer rooms we got a 1 hour talk from one of the 10 people who had tried it, talking at double speed to try and give us as much information as possible. \r\n\r\nInstead of having an actual good culture that treats staff with respect they treat people like they are at school. Decorating competitions for Christmas, Easter egg hunts, activities like a school sports day. I was once trying to get my work done while someone was sending out quizzes and activities every hour throughout the day. \r\n\r\nThey lost post/cases and I believe they lied to an independent enquiry about this. \r\n\r\nHR is terrible. \r\n\r\nThe move to the new investigator system was a disaster. They badly trained people in complicated things while removing specialists to do simple work. Then strangely enough had to move away from this. Having wasted months with the training, misrepresented the jobs, and held complaints up for months while consumers waited. \r\n\r\nMost of the people who work there at the lower level are nice and hardworking (see pros) but when things do go wrong no one steps in. I've seen people in teams just stop speaking to each other while management did nothing. \r\n\r\nThey talk in baffling management speak. They train people to use plain English and avoid \"jargon\" but do not understand that their odd touchy feeling management speak is also a type of jargon. (Their appraisals required showing that you \"communicated as a person\". )They paid money to get stickers for their doors (in their font, and colours) saying things like \"lets PULL together\". \r\n\r\nWhen staff survey results showed people were feeling unmotivated one of my managers made the team have a meeting so we could come up with 5 things that would motivate us. And we couldn't leave until we did. \r\n\r\nThey have an exceptionally high staff turnover. Some of that is not their fault - they recruited many young people who could get better jobs with a couple of years experience. But some of it is. I knew one small training intake (8 to 12 people) where none of them lasted a year because they had been recruited on a probationary salary for 6 months, but after 6 months not a single one was taken off probation, or sacked, they were all just kept working at the lower pay being told to meet targets they could not meet (because they had not been trained or supported).\r\n\r\nThe last staff survey I saw (via another expensive outside consultancy) asked how well people understood what senior management did. The findings gave a whole page to the results of this, because it was \"unusual\", as it showed that the higher up in the organisation someone was the less they understood what the top staff did. I think this probably sums the place up more than any single other thing - the higher up people were the less they knew until you got people who didn't know what they themselves did."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Still waiting for redundancy...", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "1 Jan 2020", "job_title": "Adjudicator (Permanent) in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits (non-contrib. pension, medical ins., dental ins., sick pay etc\r\nLocation\r\nNice premises\r\nGreat people\r\nSports & social committee\r\nNetworks (e.g. BAME Network, Sikh Network, Hindu Network, LGBTQ Network etc)\r\nFlexible working (e.g. remote working, flexible start/end time)\r\n25 days paid annual leave plus bank holidays", "cons": "Launching a new case management system (Phoenix) before sufficient preparation, pointless restructure (there's no difference between the current investigator role and the now defunct general casework adjudicator role), increased backlog of cases, unachievable targets for investigators, lack of experience due to high turnover since approx. 2015/2016 when restructure was implemented (getting rid of the original customer contact division was a massive loss of knowledge), tarnished reputation due to televised Dispatches investigation and poor Treasury Select Committee reviews."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Difficult time for some, but still a great employer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 Aug 2016", "job_title": "Ombudsman in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great people.

It's actually made me realise how slow adjudicators worked before. I don't believe I comprise on quality, I always learn a case inside out before delivering my view. This is done simply by using ALL of the resources available i.e Discovery notes, helplines, clinics and OMs. There are a lot of smart individuals who still work at the service who are willing to teach you what they know. That's definitely something I could credit the organisation for. I've learnt so much about various different products and I'm proud of this achievement.

I find this the most rewarding and interesting part of the role. \r\n\r\nIt does feel like a sales environment because of the pressure of hitting targets but this just makes me more motivated to close as many more cases as possible. Again this is simply achieved by adapting my telephone style, being more confident and persuasive and improving understanding In order to execute closures more successfully. I don't want to blow my own trumpet but if I'm hitting 6 closures a week than I think other investigators are just as capable. \r\n\r\nI've only been in this job a year and I'm already close to getting my grade 3. This has nothing to do with 'who you know', it's simply achieved from working as hard as I do. \r\n\r\nI don't blame the org or make excuses, I just take on the challenge.

It was about balancing out the power difference between consumers and big financial businesses. Even where I did not uphold someone's complaint  I could still help them navigate what are often confusing issues and products.", "cons": "The first thing to say is that this is a long post for which I make no apologies. So much has happened and I need to express it not only so I can move on but so people understand exactly what has happened to this organisation that I was at one time, proud to work for.  \r\n\r\nThe crux of the problem at the service comes from one simple issue. That is that knowledge and skill have somehow been downgraded so that they are now equal to ignorance (a lack of knowledge and skill). In an environment where those things are equal what tends to happen is that those with little or no knowledge and skill for the job of dealing with complaints (either at adjudicator or ombudsman level) tend to get promoted more often that those who do their jobs holding themselves and those around them to the highest standards. This problem is not unique to FOS but it is so much worse in an organisation that makes decisions that can affect peoples financial and even personal well being. \r\n\r\nI am afraid that for a good couple of years, the hard work of adjudicators ombudsman and other staff has been ignored. This has truly turned into a deeply damaging place to be with many people being made to feel that nothing they do is good enough. Many at the FOS are chronically underpaid and in return their targets are increased. If they do not meet these often unrealistic goals, they are bullied out. The way people were measured has changed year on year along with the goalposts. This still persists to this day. The appraisal system is operated behind closed doors and there is no accountability either to staff or for the poor excuse they have for a union (which is little more than a mouth piece for the executive). Essentially people are marked up or down on a scale depending on how the managers in a department feel that day for often nonsensical and spurious reasons. This then influences what pay rise and/or bonus an individual receives. The percentages have been low for years, so much so that people can hop across to the FCA and go from the early \u00a330,000's to somewhere near the early \u00a340,000's. Bearing in mind that these are usually equivalent jobs and that the FOS has chosen to locate itself in Canary Wharf (as does the FCA). \r\n\r\nThere have lately been instances where staff have had to get together and go to an external union to protect what are basic employment rights that the executive thought they could trample over. Experienced people have left and are leaving. As with many people my reason for leaving was self preservation. The environment created by the Chief and Senior staff became so toxic that my physical and mental health began to suffer significantly. I am still recovering having left months ago for a job paying a lot less at which I am much happier. Not because it is easier, but because I am now in an environment where people are valued not only by their immediate manager but also the board who are all approachable and accessible. \r\n\r\nI make no secret of the fact that I am bitter, but that does not mean that what I have to say is not worth anything. I am bitter because I gave this employer nearly a decade of my life, I worked really hard and I was committed to doing my bit to make the place a success and help build their reputation. A lot of people do this for their employer and are then made redundant. Not great but they get a pay off. My role as an adjudicator went, but there was no pay off for me because the FOS does not value its staff. There is no doubt that FOS needed to change, but the way this was managed has been brutal, unnecessary and dangerous. \r\n\r\nIt was not necessary at all to create new roles or to get rid of specialists. Having ombudsman run teams is actually a really good idea. Why? Because an experienced ombudsman running a team of specialist adjudicators is an incredibly effective way of making sure that the right outcome is quickly reached in the cases they deal with. All of the various areas (banking, PPI, Consumer Credit, Investments etc.) have their own complexities that only someone who works on those complaints all the time will know about. What has happened here is that senior people have taken a look at the easier stuff and decided that anyone can do it. You will always find easy cases in all areas, but a lot of the cases coming through the door require some level of specialism for the right outcome to be reached. \r\n\r\nWhat we have now is teams of investigators dealing with all case types led by ombudsman managers who are in the same boat as their team. They will know cases they dealt with in their previous roles but that will be about it. The demographic of the people in those roles is mostly younger relatively inexperienced adjudicators/ombudsman or former support staff with no casework experience a brilliant general knowledge but little in depth knowledge.  Most experienced ombudsman and adjudicator simply refused to apply for the new roles and not enough of this experience remains to mitigate the effects of this shift.\r\n\r\nThe result is a situation that can only damage the reputation of the service by making it more likely that decisions made by staff will be wrong. Not because they are bad at their job, but because they will be made to deal with cases outside of their knowledge. \r\n\r\nWhen I was there we had links to the new investigation teams to support them in the background and there was a database put together to help them. However, trying to explain a complex issue to someone with no experience in your area is not easy. Also, the database fell victim to the different objectives of those working on it. Some wanted a tone friendly, snappy and formulaic tool whilst others were more focussed on making guidance notes that assumed no knowledge and guided the person through a particular type of case step by step. The result was a series of guidance notes that is mostly worthless if the objective was to help people deal with their cases. The project managers who were simply concerned with 'on-boarding' (what ever that is in plain English) were I suspect, the main beneficiaries of this piece of work.\r\n\r\nWhat about training I hear you ask? Well, having viewed these training materials for myself and spoken to investigators who received it, I can say that it is generalised and wishy-washy.  It is designed to make a person more likely to be good at displaying empathy and persuasiveness rather than reaching the right outcome. That is not to say empathy and persuasiveness are not qualities a good adjudicator/investigator should display but these must been informed by having the right knowledge for the cases being dealt with. This knowledge is I am afraid conspicuous by its absence within the new training materials. There were actually sets of training materials available from all or most areas put together by senior adjudicators and ombudsman for new starters and for those needing to refresh. Hours and Hours of good effective training designed by caseworkers to help other caseworkers. None of this was used. Instead it was condensed and summarised so much that its value was lost. \r\n\r\nIt is a virtual impossibility that someone dealing with all case types can build the required knowledge to address a lot of those cases. What is more likely to happen is that they will be good at the ones they see quite often and out of their depth on the rest. With a dwindling supply of support as experienced people leave and not enough experienced people within their own teams, I really do not see how this can work.\r\n\r\nThey have also closed the Consumer Contact Division. These were the people who answered the phone for new complaints and set them up to be passed to an adjudicator. They were very good at what they did and I cannot stress enough how valuable (and underpaid) they were as part of the service. Now, your call is answered by an Investigator who is also dealing with a caseload of complaints. So in other words, they have limited time for your call and limited time to look at complaints properly in terms of giving each case the time and consideration it deserves\r\n\r\nThe FOS will release trite statements in the press about how successful all of this has been and how satisfied consumers are with the service. They will also say that times are challenging as they change to meet the evolving needs of consumers and businesses. This is a selective view of the truth at best. There are some posts on here from investigators and ombudsman managers and there are some who I know who are stressed out of their minds. What is also true is that the FOS only uses the positive data. Why? Because having spent about \u00a313m on getting PWC in to design this disaster in a time when they had an annual operating deficit of about \u00a340m per annum \u2013 they need this to work. \r\n\r\nThe reality is that before PWC came in, we were already making small changes and getting complaints handled in weeks rather than months in a lot of areas. Our consumer and business satisfaction scores were getting very good because it had been realised (perhaps a little belatedly) that getting on the phone and talking to people, showing you are interested in their side of things was the right thing to do for for both businesses and consumers. So what I am saying is that a root and branch restructure was completely unnecessary for the FOS to move forward (rather like the one done in the NHS we are all familiar with). Some smaller and more strategic changes along with getting rid of non jobs for the clique and more accountable spending would have made the place much more effective both in terms of overheads and productivity. \r\n\r\nAnother issue was the case fee. A senior member of staff actually said that we could not justify charging more than the \u00a3550 case fee because of the climate with the public sector. Firstly, the FOS is very loosely an agency of the treasury. It is definitely not public sector in the same way as the NHS. Secondly, its case fees are paid by the banks and financial institutions with there being allowances for very small organisations. So what difference would it make to a big bank to pay slightly more per case? Very little other than slightly less profit I expect. However, the executive are frightened of the bigger banks and would rather preside over a situation where the bigger banks have under staffed complaints departments and take the cheaper route of using the FOS as an external complaints handling arm.\r\n\r\nWhilst all financial business complaints stats are published on the FOS website, nothing was done to stop the practice of bigger financial businesses spreading those complaints over different companies in its group making these companies look better individually. \r\n\r\nYou would be forgiven for thinking that as the adjudicator and other roles were affectively abolished, there were redundancies. There were very few. The rest of us were moved to PPI which is now Mass Claims and also handles packaged bank accounts complaints. There was and still is I understand very little actual work for us there as most of the PPI complaints were already completed but just awaiting a court/FCA decision and our other work from our former jobs was slowly siphoned into the new structure. However, they have such little respect for us as people and employees that they effectively put us all on the scrap heap no doubt expecting us to leave and eventually when the bill is almost nothing they will fling a bit of money at the stragglers to get rid of them. \r\n\r\nI think the FOS is in such a state that it has completely lost its way. It is now displaying a severely impaired ability to do the job it was created for. That was to objectively adjudicate financial services complaints ensuring a fair and reasonable outcome. I do not think that the decisions coming out of this organisation can be trusted whilst it insists on ignoring the obvious pitfalls created by this 'new way of working'.\r\n\r\nMy advice to my former colleagues is to leave. Nothing is worth what this place is doing to you. To new starters, under no circumstances take a job at this place. To consumers and businesses, I would try to sort the complaint out amicably between yourselves.

The role was sold as a chance to work in a small team with heaps of support from management helping consumers resolve their problems with various financial institutions. The whole application and interview process was based around this simple premise. \"Fantastic!\" I thought - a job where I can actually use my skills to help people who really need someone to listen to them and represent them. \r\n\r\nI joined an organisation in chaos. After barely a month I had realised what a mess the place was in, and what a mistake I had made. \r\n\r\nOne of the major issues lies within the operating model. To summarise: the Investigator role is inherently flawed - individuals in this role have far too much to do, and spend too much time answering the phone and carrying out administrative tasks, instead of actually 'investigating' customers' problems. \r\n\r\nOn top of this, and the issue that drove me to hand in my resignation, was the pressure I felt on a day to day basis to hit targets. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Investigators are expected to close 3.5 cases a week. To 'close' a case means to come to some sort of opinion on the matter, tell the customer, and basically sell your outcome so that \r\nthe customer will agree not to take the matter any further. You can do this by either siding with the customer or the business, and it's no secret that siding with the business is far easier in terms of quickly closing a case. \r\n\r\nI found that managers didn't particularly care about the outcome you had come to - they only cared if you had closed the case.\r\n\r\nInvestigators are questioned every day by managers how many cases they are planning on \r\nclosing that day/week, and there's a weird culture of what I can only describe as public shaming if your output isn't good enough - management insist on having daily \"huddles\" where everyone stands around a whiteboard and has to justify their output. \r\n\r\nInvestigators therefore cut corners and deliver poor outcomes to customers in order to close as many cases as possible. The threat of being put on a 'performance improvement plan' (if you didn't hit your target) loomed over myself and many of my colleagues, and led to the work being sent out to customers being sub standard, poorly investigated, and just generally a farce. \r\n\r\nI have never worked in an environment so toxic before, with managers breathing down your neck so that you would hit your target.\r\n\r\nMembers of the public are being done a massive disservice because of this. Many are barely investigating problems and rushing out an 'opinion' - just so that they could demonstrate to management that they were hitting their target. It didn't matter if their 'opinion' was correct, properly researched, or even fair. It just mattered that it was sent out and a figure could be recorded against the manager's name.\r\n\r\nAnother problem I had was a lack of training and basic understanding of the product area my department dealt with. When I joined, the model was that everyone dealt with every type of financial product. This was then changed to everyone having a specialist area.\r\n\r\nMy specialist area involved complicated products, often with enormous case files and I would very regularly feel overwhelmed when speaking to customers about these products. I believe I had one very high level introduction to my area, for an hour or two, and that was the end of my formal training. \r\n\r\nThat's not to say that there aren't knowledgeable people available to help, but on an average day when you're flitting between answering the helpline, spending ages trying to get an outdated piece of software to do what you want it to, and sending out as many opinions to customers as you need to to keep your managr off your back, it was often the case that there was simply no time to really get to the crux of an issue and fully understand everything that had happened.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of my time there I felt like the FOS spent more effort on developing standard approaches to complaints instead of developing staff understanding of the actual technicalities of the products they were investigating.\r\n\r\nOn top of it all, you have the pointless messages from Senior Management. The Executive Board seem hellbent on ignoring every problem that faces the organisation - particularly the discontent in the workforce. Messages from the top are inconsistent, skirt around the issues facing the organisation, and if I'm honest, are just plain insulting. A strong disconnect exists between the average staff member at the FOS and the Executive Board. Even after the mess that was the Channel 4 Dispatches programme absolutely nothing changed. The response to that was a laughably pointless 'independent' review.\r\n\r\nThe whole place is ridiculous. The average staff member is overworked and suffering from unnecessary pressure from above. Combine this with poor messages from the Executive Board, no clear plan for the future, and you have yourself a recipe for a very disenfranchised and unhappy workforce. \r\n\r\nA huge injustice is being done to the general public and I am simply outraged at the fact that this organisation is allowed to continue operating as it is.\r\n\r\nI was thoroughly disheartened by my experience at the FOS and I am fortunate that I was able to leave when I did - I simply couldn't reconcile the 'work' I was doing at the FOS with my own set of morals."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Adjudicator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Feb 2016", "job_title": "Adjudicator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Currently there is fairly flexible working, so long as they incorporate the core hours which are between 10am and 4pm.\r\n\r\nOffice atmosphere is fairly relaxed with a smart-casual dress code and nice amenities, including a free gym.", "cons": "Despite the way development opportunities are described on job adverts for adjudicators (soon to be called investigators), this isn't the case once you're finally inside.

So here it comes.... get your popcorn and read on.\r\n\r\nThe workforce is totally disengaged, disillusioned and frustrated, this is why: \r\n1. We have very weak/inapt senior leadership, who all are home-grown. We need to cross-fertilise and bring more commercially minded leaders. Yes you read right \u2013 COMMERCIALLY MINDED. Oh I hear the gasps \u2013 \u201cbut we are not for profit\u201d. Maybe so \u2013 but your decisions still need to be commercial and fit for purpose!\r\n2. There is a complete lack of a strategic narrative.  We need a clear, compelling narrative of where we are headed and why. This isn't clear to 99% of the population and I am sorry to say - I work in HR and I am still none the wiser. SIMPLIFY. If Joe Bloggs can\u2019t articulate it in one minute \u2013 they have not understood it, meaning you haven\u2019t explained it clearly enough. What I am referring to is called a STRATEGY i.e. a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall aim. Then everything you do on day to day basis needs to flow from that\u2026.and your employees need to know the strategy so each cog they spin \u2013 they spin in the right direction. SIMPLES. \r\n3. The employee voice at the Ombudsman is completely ignored, ridiculed or talked away.  This is the very reason why people have taken to Glassdoor to express their inner dialogue. This is linked to very poor communication. Information is drip-fed, orchestrated by internal comms. The FOS was number 25 in the not-for-profit list on the Sunday Times Top 100 Company list in 2013 - can someone please explain how we have got to be one of the worst companies to work for in the UK according to the Telegraph in just 4 years (I should add that FOS was the only non-retail employer on the list). Currently on Glassdoor, we are on par with Poundland \u2013 no offence to Poundland but we are a GOVERNEMENT agency. I feel truly ashamed. What are our customers thinking when they come to us? \r\n4. No integrity or trust. What the leadership tell their employees is not what they actually want in practice. There is a real dissonance in what we say our values are and what actually happens in reality. This translate into some very poor recruitment practices (internally and externally), sink or swim culture overlaid with - if your face fits - great, if not you will be bullied out.\r\n5. Lack of opportunities for involvement, progression or upskilling. I feel like I am deskilling daily at the FOS.  Employees rely know what is expected of them (how many of you have objectives?) we don't feel appreciated (when is the last time someone said well done?) only feedback you get is when you are getting told off for something you probably had no control over in the first place \u2013 but someone has to get the blame and it\u2019s your turn so like it or lump it. Furthermore, there is no autonomy in my role and the red tape is second to none. Nobody can make a decision on their own, there are at least 5 approval stages, decision by committee. There is a simple solution here \u2013 WHAT is decided by the leadership, but HOW is decided by the people \u2013 get your employees involved and listen to what they have to say. \r\n6. Constant change \u2013 because we don\u2019t get it right first time. In HR we have had three HR transformations in three years \u2013 all badly executed, poorly planned, poorly communicated, ill-conceived. All down to inability to make decisions, inability to listen to your staff, inability to come up with a plan and stick to it. Speaking more generally to all leadership \u2013 there is no shame in standing up and admitting you got something wrong. You would get a lot more trust and respect if you did that. Rather than pretending all is well when there isn\u2019t one thing we can point to that is actually going well at the Ombudsman at the moment.\r\nWhich leads me to my conclusion \u2013 I thought I was joining the Ombudsman to work for an organisation which prides itself on fairness and doing the right thing.  Perhaps so on paper \u2013 not in reality. I have learnt how not to do things: how not to run projects, how not to communicate, how to disengage and disempower employees\u2026I hope someone can turn this tanker around, but it is sinking fast, don't be so arrogant FOS, even the biggest ships sink\u2026.I am jumping out to salvage my career.

An example: a massive organisational restructure that is handled poorly and results in hundreds of people suddenly losing their planned career progression route and therefore investment in the organisation. When faced with the resulting sudden spike in attrition / questions from the media (about this site in particular), she then commissions survey after focus group after survey about 'engagement' as a way to pretend she's \"listening\" but in reality is just asking the same questions again and again in the hope of finding an answer she likes.

The debate has been raging for some time and is likely to continue. In truth, this is something of a cathartic experience for me, simply so I can put the whole sorry fiasco of my time at the Ombudsman \u2013 and the overuse of hyphens (house style) - behind me. If it helps others to make a more informed choice about applying for one of the new roles, though, then that\u2019s a bonus. Warning \u2013 this review contains words of more than two syllables (despite what senior management may think I\u2019m sure you and the general public are clever enough to understand them).\r\n\r\nThe new way of working does not work. In a world that is increasingly specialised, and in the most complex financial centre in the world, it is not practical, feasible or safe to bypass specialism and technical knowledge in favour of an approach that says everyone can do everything. The banks don\u2019t do it. The insurers don\u2019t do it. The big asset managers don\u2019t do it. The regulators don\u2019t do it. Yet the management at the Ombudsman service seem to think they can circumvent the need for a coherent division of labour based on technical expertise. Is it arrogance or stupidity? Maybe it\u2019s both.\r\n\r\nThey can\u2019t bypass it. It will end badly when some poor unfortunate investigator who\u2019s just trying to hit their (impossible) target makes the sort of error that gathers traction until there\u2019s an inquiry, a JR, a Parliamentary report uncovering \u201csignificant failings and systemic mismanagement\u201d, an embarrassing Treasury Select Committee session for Ms Wayman (or her hapless replacement if she\u2019s jumped ship by then), and a rebranding exercise similar to what the FCA went through in 2012/13.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, though, there are thousands of ordinary employees at the FOS no doubt tearing their hair out while being whipped (figuratively) from behind by some just-out-of-university-and-high-on-the-power manager. The atmosphere was toxic when I left, people were bolting out of the door every Friday in their droves, and the management just does not care. If you\u2019re thinking of applying, I really wouldn\u2019t. If you\u2019re there and trying to ride it out, please don\u2019t. You deserve better than to be treated with utter contempt by an employer that values your skills not one iota and doesn\u2019t even have the courtesy to give you meaningful updates on what the next stage of its \u201cplan\u201d is (probably because there is no plan). Value yourself, leave if you can, and pick up your dignity on the way out.\r\n\r\nMy other big bugbear with the FOS is the total lack of career opportunity and the way the organisation always seems to promote the wrong people. It\u2019s quite an amazing skill in itself. \r\n\r\nWith the possibility of one exception, every manager I have had the misfortune to encounter has been a massive disappointment \u2013 while relationships may start positively, they eventually show their true colours and it comes like a side-swipe from the blue. They are lazy, self-interested, unprincipled even to vindictiveness, incompetent, crawling and wholly lacking in any substance, intelligence or style. They ride on the back of other people\u2019s hard work, take the credit, take delight in telling far more worthy people that they\u2019re \u201cnot ready\u201d for promotion, refuse to support those who deserve to progress \u2013 and then get promoted themselves as the final two-fingered salute. Some are now Ombudsman Managers \u2013 I pity the poor consumers who will have their complaints incorrectly rejected by them (or incorrectly upheld, which is just as bad because at some point there has to be an embarrassing backtrack), and then have no further recourse to someone who actually knows what they\u2019re doing (except a judge \u2013 and who has the time or money?).\r\n\r\nI could go on forever but there is simply too much. If it were possible to give the FOS no stars at all then I would. Alas, you can\u2019t have everything in life! So, I\u2019ll end on a little note about the Board, which has been conspicuous by its silence throughout this interesting interlude. Perhaps if we ever went up to the fifteenth floor to visit its fabled haunt \u2013 the boardroom \u2013 we might find out whether it\u2019s actually on the same planet as the rest of us. Because when all is said and done, how is it possible for (presumably) intelligent, qualified business \u201cexperts\u201d to sign off on a plan that makes the entire organisation unfit for purpose in today\u2019s financial world? Maybe the Exec gagged them for being slightly negative about the new way of working.\r\n\r\nFor those still at the FOS and despairing, there is hope but it needs hard work. Apply, apply, apply for other jobs. Do financial exams \u2013 self fund if the FOS has now withdrawn sponsorship. Chase recruiters like your life depends on it \u2013 believe it or not they are still interested in the skills FOS employees can offer. It is the only way you will be able to leave, but hopefully when you do it will be for something less archaic, more stimulating and far more rewarding.

The target started out as 5 a week, but after the staff survey which was leaked (I will get onto that later) it was reduced to 3.5 a week.  Alot of people might look at this and say it's not that much, but to give a little context behind this, I would pick up a case on something I've never seen, try to understand the issue and give an answer to both the business and the consumer. And hopefully close it then or as quickly as possible. But I have limited knowledge or resources to help or guide me through the nuances of complaints, and even the law itself. So yes there is pressure, and its not just that. Recently the message went around that managers and senior leadership aren't putting pressure on the Investigators and maybe it was self-inflicted, but it's hard to stand by that sentiment when all my direct manager talks about is the number of assessments we've sent out and the number of cases closed.\r\n\r\nKnowledge - Lack of knowledge may be more apt here. I can only speak from my experience, but when I moved over as a PPI adjudicator to Investigation I had no training on products themselves. I did get training on our approach to complaints, which may be how we look at complaints. But I had no knowledge to underpin my understanding of how a product works, its aims, and its flaws. I don\u2019t know if this has changed at all, but we\u2019ll see when Dispatches is on as an undercover reporter joined as an Investigator and filmed the whole thing. After being in the Investigator role I can safely say that my knowledge is slightly better, but this is through my own learning and understanding on simple cases. But forget anything like pensions or investments it\u2019s still a bewildering mess to me.\r\n\r\nLeadership \u2013 unfortunately the biggest problem at the moment. The change program was bought in badly, communication is rubbish and so far nothing has changed. After the disastrous staff survey last summer there was a glimmer of hope change would happen. So far, nothing apart from some lovely committee\u2019s/working groups. Nothing has changed in communication, nothing has changed in transparency and nothing has changed in the lack of direction and leadership by senior management. It\u2019s this lack of change which has led to emails from senior leadership being leaked to the press, and the current inquiry by the Treasury. In fact, watching the answers Caroline Wayman gave made a lot of people angry as it wasn\u2019t the honest truth.\r\n\r\nCareer path \u2013 None whatsoever, though you can get demoted if you don\u2019t answer and close enough cases. Remember that bit earlier about targets, and pressure. Of course the chance of losing you pay rise after working hard, because you haven\u2019t closed enough cases wouldn\u2019t add pressure to say an Investigator with a mortgage and family?\r\n\r\nFuture outside FOS \u2013 None whatsoever, I am actively looking to leave. I can see the ship sinking and I\u2019m trying to get into a lifeboat. Problem is having Financial Ombudsman Service on my CV is actually hindering my search.

It is too subservient to Groupthink \u2013 the existing layers of management just reinforce the same hackneyed old mindset and uphold the status quo. The organisation is not inclusive in any way, shape or form. Women have little representation in decision-making at the upper echelons of the service; minority colleagues are practically non-existent too. Even down to the personalities it promotes, the FOS only ever values a particular sort of person. If you\u2019re an extrovert you may stand a chance but forget it if you\u2019re an introvert - the quiet and thoughtful are overlooked and criticised for their lack of impact, even if their real contribution is far in excess of the favoured.\r\n\r\nThis impossible culture can only be changed from the outside. The management are suffering from a severe case of cognitive dissonance - an interesting phenomenon where the more a person or group is criticised the more strongly they will cling to the idea they\u2019re trying to promote.

Why? Because unless you were a \u2018favourite\u2019 you were never going to be promoted, no matter how hard you worked and irrespective of how competent you were. I felt that only extreme crawling and flirting with senior colleagues would get you noticed \u2013 and I saw too much of that and would never stoop. And, to loosely follow a quote from Ford (he of the Ford Motor Company): \u201cYou can have any opinion you want so long as you agree.\u201d This is why so many incompetent people now hold positions far up the pay scale, and this is why an ill thought out restructure has been nodded through. \r\n\r\n2.\tI could not stand having to build relationships with complainants, knowing I was going to disappoint them. Some cases \u2013 such as fixed rate business loans \u2013 were deliberately \u2018put to one side\u2019 for years before an approach was formulated. What this really means is that nobody senior wanted to put their name to an approach, leading to a perpetual bottleneck. Having to fob people off \u2013 especially when they tell you that they are on the brink of losing their home or that they have nothing to feed their children \u2013 is very hard. I felt terrible. Who wouldn\u2019t? But you either tow the official line of you lose your job and your ability to pay rent/mortgage. The Ombudsman talks about being \u2018bold and decisive\u2019 although it is anything but.\r\n\r\n3.\tSome people here talk about how those unhappy with the way things are should just leave. But that is wrong on two counts. The first is that some people genuinely care about levelling the playing field between banks and consumers and the FOS is the one place that (theoretically) can do that. Others, like myself, graduated into the recession. Our intended career paths were destroyed early on and when we saw that the FOS was recruiting we saw this as a potential career opportunity. But, once there, it is extremely hard to leave.  You are not taught much about financial products \u2013 only the extreme basics \u2013 and most of my knowledge came from financial exams that I decided to take or research on Google.  Now employers have wised up to the fact that investigators deliberately are not taught much, and many have frozen recruitment from the FOS. It is a terrible shame for the staff (especially the non-managers \u2013 see below) who do their best. A workman really can blame his/her tools in this case.\r\n\r\n4.\tManagers are almost always dreadful. I can say with complete sincerity that most of my managers would spend their day whispering to their favourites (and ensuring that the favourites got any of the slim opportunities for progression) or tapping away on their phone. Or simply surfing the internet. They bullied their team with demands for \u2018stretch targets\u2019 week on week that invariably meant quality was cut. I became depressed during my time at FOS, and a large part of the reason why was the managers. I can say hand on heart that most of my managers were vindictive because they had nothing else to occupy them and went out of their way to make my life as difficult as possible. I cannot say what here as that would identify me \u2013 but the fact that these people are not \u2018Ombudsman Managers\u2019 speaks volumes about the very poor state the FOS is now in. \r\n\r\n5.\tThe targets are not realistic. In fact, the target never stops \u2013 even if you get married, it\u2019s Christmas or a relative has died. The target keeps on plodding away in the background, meaning you have to put in insane hours if you dare to take any annual leave. I would often take cases home on weekends and work 10-12 hours a day in the office. Meanwhile managers, who have no target and know nothing about financial products, would saunter in at 10:00 and leave at 16:00.\r\n\r\n6.\tThe restructure has been directed terribly. We once received an email explaining that for the FOS to continue working as it was it would have to charge over \u00a3700 per case by way of a case fee to the bank being complained about. Anybody who has gone on the Bank of England inflation calculator can plainly see that had the old case fee (\u00a3500) been increased in line with inflation the FOS should be charging banks almost \u00a3800 a case. The fact that a \u2018new\u2019 \u00a3550 case fee was introduced effectively reset the case fee at a lower monetary amount.

They appear to occasionally do some quality checking, deal with complaints about their staff's behaviour and spend the rest of their time having meeting about meetings.\r\n- Numerous layers of pointless bureaucracy. The organisation could half the number of managers and heads of department overnight and it would have little impact on the work.\r\n- Recent changes have lead to a total disregard for technical specialism and knowledge. Senior management seem to think that any Grade 1 adjudicator (now called an investigator) with a years experience can take on any case about any product. This is hopelessly naive and will lead to numerous incorrect outcomes, more claims management companies referring spurious claims to the service, increasing the workload and prevent the people who actually need the service's help from getting it effectively.\r\n- They've spent millions employing an external consultancy firm who have added nothing beyond 'stand around a white board every morning and discuss the work before pledging how much you will get done this week'. This has increased micro-management in an organisation already prone to it. \r\n- When applying for new management roles one of the questions was 'Tell us how our changes will make the organisation better' (they won't!). It's Orwellian in its propagandist manipulation.\r\n- No oversight of managers. A bad manager will be allowed to carry on despite numerous members of their team going off sick or leaving with mental health issues, due to their behaviour. The manager will never face sanction and anyone raising a grievance will be seen as a 'trouble maker'.\r\n- Anyone who raises any of the above issues will be unable to get promoted to any new role. Only total agreement is valued.\r\n- HR policies seem to be deliberately vindictive and unhelpful\r\n\r\nThe main problem is the current changes which they have put in place. These were 'trialled' but even before the trials were over it was decided that they'd roll this out across the organisation. Simply put, they expect investigators (usually former adjudicators) and Ombudsman Managers (either former managers or former ombudsman) to be able to take on any case, about any product and reach the correct conclusion. This is a fantasy as the complexity of many of these products means you have to have a baseline of knowledge before you can even attempt them. The new approach works for very basic admin errors and problems with current accounts but when it comes to jurisdictional questions regarding consumer credit agreements, complex mortgage issues and pensions/investments complaints, you need the knowledge or you WILL get the answer wrong. This has been ignored. In addition managers who have never been ombudsman before are expected to write legally binding decisions and be the technical guiding force of their teams when they often have less knowledge than the investigators they are managing. Similarly ombudsman who have never been managers before suddenly have to manage investigators and many of them lack any of the skills necessary to be an effective manager.\r\n\r\nIn the five years I worked there, I saw the organisation go from a strongly lead, vibrant, exciting place to work, where the people were engaged and cared about the work, to a shambolic parody of its former self, run by an exec completely disconnected from the reality of the situation they're in and peopled by a demoralised, disengaged and thoroughly fed up staff.\r\n\r\nMany people like me who saw no benefit in becoming an investigator (why would we want to do a job which involves taking incoming cold calls from the public, working on Saturdays and requires us to do more work with less training when there was no associated pay rise?) are leaving. The brain drain of the Ombudsman's brightest and best has been continuing in earnest for some time and shows no sign of slowing down."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "The sad truth", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "4 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Team Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Current and former staff have found a medium to express their sadness and disappointment with the direction we've taken as an organisation through this site - today ranking second lowest in the telegraph's some of the worst 10 companies to work for - according to its own staff.", "cons": "When I joined the service I was very proud of us, my job and our role in society.

And I thought politicians were bad at answering questions.\r\n- FOS has moved away from prioritising getting the right outcome to wanting to get a case 'resolved' as quickly as possible. \r\n- Niche/complex casework areas are not valued. Their knowledge and expertise are rapidly leaving the FOS for pastures greener. \r\n- FOS thinks it can harness these expertise on an internal guidance system but this is never going to work.

In Truth, nothing could of prepared me for the environment in which I was drafted into. \r\n\r\nMy manager had just been promoted into the position, having been at the Ombudsman herself for only 6 months, we were her first team (formed from scratch).  Herself, in her early 20's, she didn't have a clue about managing people, and having been there for less than six months, didn't really know too much about the job she was overseeing either.  But she had an eerily close relationship with the head of the department , which obviously, could just be a coincidence. However premature & fast tracked promotions for people in certain circles were endemic within the organisation at the time. Consequently, her lack of experience meant that she was always trying to 'act' as to how she perceived a manager to be, instead of actually being a manager. It was like she was a robot reading from a textbook on how to manage, and trying to implement the text word for word. Instead of using initiative, intuition etc. you know, using human traits and adapting to resolve any given scenario. She was trying to shoehorn textbook answers out of her management book into every situation.\r\n\r\nOnto the quality checks. Micro management was rife, with your manager and various appointed sub-ordinates, checking your work several times a week. Problem with this is, that they all had different standards, different interpretations of the \"Ombudsman way\". This inconsistency meant that the goalposts were always being changed, week on week. I would literally get marked down (and fail my QC) one week. So I would change my approach accordingly, to only be marked down the following week, by someone else, for doing what I'd been told to do only a week prior. \r\n\r\nThis causes massive problems as you are judged as an adjudicator by the success rate of your Quality checks, indeed fail 3 QC's and your on a P.I.P.\r\n\r\nThe last straw for me, was when I failed a QC of one of my phone calls with a stakeholder, My manager failed it because I hesitated when the stakeholder questioned our ability to service there complaint. Well at the time, I actually agreed with stakeholder, and lieing doesn't come natural to me, so I did hesitate before I lied to them and assured the stakeholder that we are going to give there complaint the investigation it deserved. But even so, to fail a call for a brief pause before answering someone is tyrannical (knowing that three fails and your in trouble)\r\n\r\nI left the Ombudsman a shadow of the person that walked through the door. My time there consisted of always being whipped, brow beaten, stripped of my identity and told that I am not good enough. Like a horse, i'd almost been 'broken' into submission.  Luckily I had just about enough confidence left to get out, I've now been working for the same company since I left. I'm an accountant for a global top four industry leader. I love it here, and they appreciate me; more money, great environment, more responsibility, a lot more autonomy, achievable ladder to climb.

Many will be friendly until we tell them that we are not upholding their complaint. They will then accuse us of being in the pockets of the banks. Let me make this clear - we have no motivation to reject complaints unfairly. We do not salivate at the prospect of telling you that you aren't going to get any more money. We do not want to have to defend our position to you for an hour or more on the phone.\r\n\r\nAdjudicators do the bulk of the organisation's work but are not rewarded particularly well in terms of pay and opportunites for progression. The salary is good if you are just out of uni but if you're not then its pretty rubbish. Saying this, however, it is not so much of a problem if you think strategically. You can stay for a couple of years, develop your skills, and then go to another job paying 10k more. FOS is not really a place for a long term career, but then again, I don't think many people would want to spend their whole career in a complaints environment.\r\n\r\nTeam managers don't really do a lot. They keep their eye on the figures, customer service and deal with service complaints, however, without technical knowledge, they are limited in the help they can give adjudicators. Current team sizes could easily be increased 50%, reducing the number of team managers. There would then be a bit more money to go around for the rest of us.\r\n\r\nFOS has a relatively small number of truly technical experts - ie. adjudicators that have been in the job for more than 10 years. Unfortunately, in the battle for promotion, these individuals can be sidelined to make way for the younger generation. You therefore often have relatively inexperienced people mentoring/checking work etc instead of those best placed to do this. I think FOS needs to appreciate, and make more use of, those that have the most knowledge.

Indeed, it was one of the best places to work in the Times polls for several years. Work is generally dependent on demand and nobody minded that because we were all capable of managing our workloads and finding things to work that needed work.\r\n\r\nOver the last year the entire organisation has completely changed its structure. There's no trade secrets here - the Ombudsman service's complaints will be worked in the main by \"Investigators\" and they will be managed by \"Ombudsman Managers\" in the future. Investigators effectively replace the \"Adjudicator\" role, brought in to assist the Ombudsmen that were originally writing the decisions, but with the advent of the multi million PPI complaints, needed the assistance of adjudicators to cope with the caseload.\r\n\r\nAdjudicators in the main specialise in different fields, such as PPI, Banking and Credit, and so on and so forth and all the various areas have sub divisions. Nothing you don't know from the website or can ask the press office about. Standard stuff.\r\n\r\nInvestigators do not specialise and are in fact encouraged not to by \"sharing knowledge\" within \"pods\" - which are groups of investigators led by an Ombudsman manager. They are expected to share their knowledge and experience of different case types and financial products around in order to \"make the service relevant and sustainable\" for the future.\r\n\r\nThat would work, except the pods aren't really balanced by the knowledge base that the adjudicators have. The first recruitment process looked haphazard and ignored previous skills, relying more on interview technique to justify reapplying for a similar, if not identical, job with a different wage structure.\r\n\r\nThe management and the press office have over the last year spent an ordinate amount of time undermining the majority of the adjudicators by effectively putting a clock on their careers. Many of the best adjudicators have already left and more will follow.\r\n\r\nThe service seems to need to shrink in size for various reasons, and management are taking some startling steps to address this. There are several adjudicators from my area looking to leave as a result: I myself am considering my future and looking to leave at the earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe shame of this all, as we have discussed, is that the core values of the service which we have upheld over a number of years were good: sharing knowledge, doing what we say we will, do the right thing and similar, all contributing to the best of our customer service. We weren't a perfect organisation - who is? But we all bought into the message and worked for one another, and our consumers (both ordinary people and businesses, and their representatives).\r\n\r\nTwo colleagues of mine have been managed out and I fear that I am in a similar position. Having never so much as had a service complaint raised against me in all of my four years at the service, with awards for customer service and having trained others, I find myself in the unenviable position of having to justify my quality of work in the most pressured and most extraordinary ways possible. My manager has seen more of me during work hours than my desk has and the constant negativity towards my work has taken its toll. This came during a time of great upheaval in my personal life and the more pressure he placed on me, the more I felt there was a incredible lack of pastoral care and the humanity you normally associate with us as a service. \r\n\r\nIt feels very much that we can go to the nth degree for the consumers and if it's in the \"business needs\" but when you need support from the company to get things back on track they don't want to know and would rather find ways of getting you to quit, whether it is being passive aggressive unpleasant for a long period, or undermining you with meetings, PIPs (performance improvement plans - which are meant to be about improving but in reality are a way of throwing you under a very large bus).\r\n\r\nOne such colleague of mine is going through an even more horrendous time at home with a family member seriously ill and effectively acting as a carer. His manager is aware of this but hasn't reported this to the line manager, who is of the opinion that he can't be trusted with work. \r\n\r\nHe's one of the most dedicated and hard working individuals that I know, and the quality of his work over a three week period on a \"new work stream\" wasn't of the highest standard (but wasn't of any risk to the business either) and that justified, apparently, putting him on a PIP and furthering his anxieties and depression. He's not alone and I have seen several managers - who will say to your face \"we're not managing you out - but\" do this to their adjudicators.\r\n\r\nThe management structure as a whole at the Ombudsman service is broken. Adjudicators with no managerial qualifications or experience were hired to take on teams. Many of these are now doing further damage to the organisation by demotivating their teams to try and thin out the organisation. The attrition rate is awful and it's not surprising given what is going on behind closed doors.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend joining the Ombudsman service - I would advise you go and try the FCA, for which a number of former colleagues have joined and are flourishing in their new roles - and wondering why they stayed so long at the service in the first place.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I am considering my future and whether I can justify the additional stress to convince management to keep me on. \r\n\r\nI always put our consumers first and if I hand in my notice soon, I can do so with my head held high because I have always wanted to uphold the decent values of the service, and to help people as best I could wherever they needed it.\r\n\r\nI used to be proud to work at the Financial Ombudsman Service.

It's with sadness that we've found ourselves in this current position. The thoughts and advice on FoS as an employer which I express here have been echoed from many across all levels of seniority. \r\n \r\nExec's no longer ask how we feel in a way that gives us the security that we won't be punished or judged for expressing ourselves in a constructive manner. We used to do an anonymous staff survey every year which they recently pulled, it was done by an external company. Instead, now they use an internal method and ask very different questions that tell them only what they want to hear. They refer to this as a \"pulse check\". They also say exec drop in sessions are to \"get to the heart\" with how we are feeling with things. When your staff are being lied to, manipulated, taken advantage of, even bullied when asking valid questions, who is going to feel comfortable speaking out? Not many can risk that. It's too easy to be identified and who wants to be singled out? \r\n\r\nThis is why many of us have resorted to Glass Door to make our feelings known. This was picked up by FT Advisor in an article online. You will need to search for it, it was published, 27 July 2016, and titled \"Fears FoS restructure \u2018could harm quality of decisions\u2019\" The journalist obviously has an inside source. But our organisation's response? \"it's not based on fact\" I am afraid it very much is. \r\n\r\nFoS has an ethos, values we commit to. For much of the time that I've worked here (between 5-10 years) one of the greatest things about it is that it did not feel like some of the meaningless values many organisations claim of themselves. It felt real, it was imbedded in the culture, our values mattered. It was our identity and we were proud to embrace it. Of course, no place is perfect and there are always exceptions, yet it still truly felt genuine and sincere from a majority of the people who work here.  It is what made us proud to work here and what previously placed our organisation in the Sunday Times top places to work for.\r\n\r\nLast year changes in structure were announced. Change can scary, but we understood why. Many were excited about these changes. It meant working in a better way which would benefit our consumers. As it has developed over the last year, it has been nothing but an utter calamity. One disappointment and shock after another. Our best people have been devalued, demoralised and discarded. \r\n \r\nThe internal recruitment being carried out is not so that our most talented were chosen on either merit or even on the basis of their achievements. Instead, it's been very difficult for many of us to make much sense of it at all. It's been poorly managed and far from transparent. People were denied roles for nonsensical, unreasonable and even offensive reasons. \"We didn't realise who you were, we had never heard of you, you are doing really well but just do it a bit longer, you don't understand the challenges because you are too enthusiastic, there was just someone better than you this time, you are too confident\"\r\n\r\nWe are worried about the future of the organisation and the impact that this could have on decisions. Like a sales team whose main goal is profit for themselves, FoS as an organisation have become about how quickly we can provide an answer regardless about how it is done or whether it is right or wrong. What is happening now internally could destroy us as an organisation. Managers are being put into positions with little technical knowledge. Ombudsmen are now line managers and many of them lack in people skills. Investigators will be providing answers about products they haven't been trained in. We are already seeing cases come back that are a mess. Many are jumping ship before it gets worse because we see what's coming, and it is coming. We also don't want to be part of a culture where speed is valued over doing the right thing in the right way for both parties. \r\n\r\nSadly, the majority of people applying for the new roles are doing so because they have to now, not because they are on board with this vision anymore. Many will be in roles they didn't want and felt forced into. The CEO, Caroline Wayman, and her team have now lost the chance at retaining many of the most knowledgable and passionate people. The loyalties of the best and the brightest of FoS have shifted.\r\n\r\nThey do not care about our point of view, when we have challenged them constructively we are shot down. They don't respect their employees anymore, and many of us are beginning to think perhaps they never did, perhaps we were the fools. Either way, we no longer recognise the culture are in anymore. People come to us for help, we give them answers that can have a severe impact on their lives. We must do the right thing regardless of the time it takes. However, if FoS can't be open, honest, communicate like people, care about the world around them in regards to their own staff, how can they be expected to do it with those who need our help. \r\n \r\nThe CEO, Caroline Wyman, will no doubt continue to gloss over this feedback as she has been, only addressing these feelings of ours when she is forced to. But always with the same manner as if she were waving a pesky fly from her face. \r\n\r\nThere is a recent article written by our ex-CEO, Ms Natalie Ceeney that has been making the rounds. We wish our leaders here would take heed to. It's hard to imagine it wasn't written in light of what is happening here. \r\n\r\nIt is in Linked In, it's called \"Don't Believe Your Own Hype\" published 19 July, 2016.\r\n\r\nI would have posted links but they are not allowed in reviews."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "My tuppence worth....", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "16 Jul 2017", "job_title": "Support in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "BUPA for all levels\r\nGood pension\r\n6 months maternity pay\r\n2 cafes\r\n2 gyms", "cons": "This site is getting out of hand and starting to cause damage.

Pretty much everyone I know is trying to get out, and all for the same reasons.\r\n\r\nYears ago, subject matter experts were seen as a valuable commodity - yet today everyone is expected to be broadly competent in all subjects and expert in none. Consequently, many cases end up being handled by people without the requisite specialist knowledge. This results in under-trained investigators making best guesses in complex and nuanced situations, and the subsequent decisions are often inconsistent or plain wrong. Quality checks seems to have been abandoned in some areas, with predictable consequences - it's pot luck whether or not cases are routed to someone competent. I feel deeply sorry for the front line investigators, who are expected to deal with consumers and businesses often about very technical things, but without even the most basic of required training.\r\n\r\nThe executive team itself is profoundly inadequate and broadly mistrusted. The CEO is pushing through an extremely disruptive and unpopular programme of reforms in which all existing roles are being discarded and replaced with roles that look remarkably similar but with very little flexibility or career progression. This exercise is also being used as an excuse to clean out huge numbers of staff who do not find a suitable place for themselves in the new order. Consequently we are losing our most competent and valuable employees at an alarming rate and morale is lower than most of us ever thought possible. \r\n\r\nThe ill-thought through changes dreamt up by the executive are dishonestly promoted as successful. There is a conspicuous lack of MI to show that the new changes work any better  and those on the ground who have the misfortune of implementing them widely acknowledge this new regime to be an unutterable disaster. The CEO has surrounded herself with a clique of fawning yes-men (who, incidentally, were told that they needed to adjust their moral compasses by the previous CEO!). The changes are short-sighted and are being implemented purely to make the executive look good in the short-term. \r\n\r\nThe rhetoric around the need for change is that we need to be financially sustainable which few disagree with. But it is clear that the case fee has been kept unduly low - a very modest increase of a few pounds would solve our financial woes, but there seems no appetite for this at the board level. Perhaps due to political pressure? Also telling is the lack of minutes of the board meetings - none have been published since March 2016. Have they stopped being published or have the board simply lost interest?"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Abhorrent employer", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Jan 2017", "job_title": "Investigator in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Like any organisation FOS has some truly exceptional employees that believe in their job, FOS, and what we do\r\n- Relatively good work benefits.

We then became tired of the terrible grading structure as it was impossible to progress unless you wanted to become a manager or we one of the very, very lucky few who jumped to Ombudsman. So they released the 'Investigator' role with a whole new structure and pay grades to boot that were higher than Adjudicator.\r\n\r\nSounds like progress right? Wrong. When re-structuring they decided to do away with many of our specialist teams and just pool us together so we can solve 'anything'. This doesn't work for a myriad of reasons that should be plainly obvious. Also they decided it would be smart to do away with our administration teams so we now have to setup cases, do all the admin around them and investigate, hit unreachable targets and learn a huge number of specialist areas that we've had little to no training on. Genius.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that the new Ombudsman Manager role to manage said Investigators has primarily been filled with people who have little to no experience as a manager. Most are previous technical experts in respective areas who have no idea of our systems, processes and most crucially how to manage. 80% of the time we're told it's all a 'new way of working' (anyone from FOS reading this will likely chuckle at that phrase, as they know it covers all manner of sin), and want us to do things that simply do not make sense for us, the businesses or consumers.\r\n\r\nAn Investigator's job is to balance the job of an Administrator, Adjudicator, technical lead and self-manage whilst being constantly bombarded with 'new' processes and management quangos that drive everyone into the ground. You may think that writing such a review is because i've been slighted in my role and I have some form of grievance against FOS. I am actually doing quite well because for now i'm simply cruising along playing the game (whilst internally hating every idiotic second of it). No, it's actually because of the disgraceful conduct in which the management are treating my colleagues, and systematically bringing down an organisation I was once very proud to work for.\r\n\r\nYou won't find a single Investigator within our organisation that doesn't loathe their job and have a multitude of negative things to say about our 'new ways of working'. Good luck getting an inteligible response to a complaint, the person you're dealing with has in truth probably only dealt with a handful, if at all, of those types of complaints before and won't be aware of basics right up to law on the subject.\r\n\r\nOur CEO is non-existent, nor the YES men around her that have risen through the ranks for no apparent reason.

You might think well isn't processing a complaint quickly what you should be doing any way, well yes, but, it shouldn't be on the basis of a process that relentlessly moves forward with unreasonable performance targets as the driving force. \r\nAs the obsession with the financial bottom line takes a grip all the platitudes about caring for staff, work life balance is just that, and hollow to boot. The latest thing for staff, because we are so well thought of, is we now have to apply to do roles which essentially we are already doing. The roles have been retitled but the work is pretty much the same (we aren't supposed to spot that), the clear intention behind this is to get rid of people, have less staff doing more, in truth a cost cutting exercise. In my opinion in the long term this is short sighted, they want us to be a glorified call centre having a little bit of knowledge on all subjects. How that's going to help consumers remains to be seen.  At the moment we do still have set areas of expertise so banking is dealt with by people who specialise in banking complaints, investments by skilled people who understand and can talk sensibly on the subject, insurance is so broad motor, household, pet, medical, travel, legal and so on all at the moment dealt with by people focussed on those areas. \r\nThe new way of working will be to take phone calls on all complaints with the expectation that you provide the consumer with a good experience, of course the moment you show it's an area you aren't familiar with or show a lack of confidence and you fumble and stumble around trying to be reassuring and build a rapport, it\u2019s no likely to go down well. \r\nAs for the business of having to apply for one of the 'new' roles (laughingly also called opportunities) it seems to be a wholly unnecessary exercise when you take into account the amount of information from appraisals, daily, weekly, monthly observation by management etc that\u2019s held on all members of staff. The process of bringing out the new roles has a been a typically (for this place) ridiculously protracted one and caused a great deal of unnecessary anxiety among staff. Further it's been made clear that if you aren't successful applying for one of the \u2018new\u2019 roles you can either leave or be consigned to PPI ultimately to be made redundant or, as is no doubt hoped for, become so disenchanted that you just leave. \r\nAnd to top it all, just for a laugh, if you\u2019re 'lucky' enough to be offered one of the new jobs you then have to accept the new salary maximum range. And just to make you feel that you really matter, if you\u2019re already earning in excess of the \u2018new\u2019 maximum, although you can still receive annual increases for the moment, in two years\u2019 time a correction will be applied and your salary will arbitrarily be reduced to fit in with the maximum so a substantial pay cut looms, and that\u2019s what\u2019s thought to be a decent way to treat staff. How that is fair or reasonable is beyond me and it's clearly designed to hit the older longer serving staff at all levels who have misguidedly given loyal service believing this was a decent company to work for.

However, unless your one of the favourites, no matter how many times you can apply for a promotion (with endless amount of hard work you've put in) if you're not in there with all the managers, when they have their meeting to decide who gets the promotion, you can kiss your chances good bye, but that's just me speaking from someone who's been declined 3 times in the last 18 months. The moral is low, were put on one work stream to the next expecting to figure out what to do. There was a day when we went through stressful accreditation - now we're being told to just follow some thing and work it out. People that were once adjudicators the next day are step up managers - there's no application or job spec again, if you're in there with the right people you'll go far. No one wants to do anything team wise, everyone seems miserable, there's no sense of belonging. \n\nThere's always a 8 week notice period - which is frustrating. Having been told you're with us with the new way of working or not, those who want to leave, which is most of us, are finding it unreasonable to work a 8 week notice. The new structure doesn't sound like all it's cracked up to be and I am so grateful that during my interview (3rd stage) I got to I \"didn't\" tick as many boxes as someone else - even though I was told I should 100% apply next time because my examples and understanding was fantastic.

A step in the wrong direction in terms of career progression.\r\n\r\nI worked in IT Service Desk and I use that term loosely because I am having a hard time justifying doing any actual IT work there. If you are a grad and have interest in computers and love fixing things, do not apply to work in IT here. This is a dead end job - you will not learn any valuable transferable skills here. This whole company is just a glorified call centre and what ever department you work in most of your job will be just talking on the phone. You are not encouraged to learn anything more then whats required to do your job. There are a couple of in-house applications you will be supporting - skills which are useless if you decide to go and work somewhere else. If you want to know anything more advanced, sorry, not in your job description.\r\n\r\nIf you like solving problems and really finding the root of the issue, I tell you now you are in for a massive disappointment. You're not here to use your brain, you're just a keyboard monkey who types the problem down and passes it into the abyss not really knowing if it's going to get resolved by someone and in what time. If you're familiar with a ticketing system, you know when a problem arrives you have certain amount of time to resolve it depending on its severity. Here this means nothing. You will be told quality of service is the holy grail of the IT department, but this is coming from the people with 0 experience in doing the actual job. For the last couple of months of my stay all I did was apologise to people who called us for help because their problems were not resolved for weeks on end. Several factors contribute to this appalling lack of service:\r\n\r\n- People are not being trained:\r\n++Absolute lack of any structured training. If you want to know something go and find out for yourself. When the department is being run by non technical people, they are not in the best position to advise what you need to know so your only option is to find experienced people who have been around for a while. Even then everyone has their own way of doing things so you will either learn the bad habits or the good habits. In my time there, not one person was trained in the same way.\r\nIf you think you're going to a big organisation where technology is bleeding edge and you're going to learn cool stuff like Migration, Imaging, or even just installing and building stuff - forget about it! This job doesn't even require you to hold a BTEC diploma in computing. What you will be doing is burning CDs, ripping CDs, releasing emails, changing passwords, and telling people to restart things - a lot - and there isn't even a path you can follow to progress. If you're tech savvy you may have a chance of moving up to second line. If you're not, well then good luck to you. \r\n\r\n- There is no team atmosphere\r\n++ In every meeting we are constantly being reminded that we need to work as a team bla bla bla. Unfortunately the nature of the job makes this impossible. It is so heavily stat driven that you end up only caring about meeting your own targets. When you pick up someone else' job you will find they do it in a different way to you and you get into an argument that this was not done right or there's lack of information. Blame culture is very strong here and its even worse between teams.\r\n\r\n- Recruitment of quality people and not being able to hold on to good people\r\n++ The management and HR do not seem to care about your technical abilities, it is all about your manners over the phone. If you're polite enough and can type at a reasonable rate, congratulations you're hired. Do you know what a computer is? irrelevant. Yes, this is the state of an IT department. Some of the people calling us about the problem even tell us how to resolve it only because we have access to a particular system and they don't. Simply embarrassing. There is a Catch 22 situation here - it is very difficult to recruit the type of person that will fit this role. If you get someone interested in IT, they will leave within 6 months of being here. If you get someone who knows nothing about computers, they will increase the work load for everyone else. What you want is someone who has been doing service desk all their life and does not want to be anything else.\r\nThere's also laziness problem, I have never worked with so many half-arsed people. Simple, 2 clicks issues are being passed around like a hot potato and it's only too easy to call in sick and get away with it. Some people have more sick days then I have holidays - impossible to have a fully functioning team week in week out\r\n\r\n- The only thing lower then the moral in the team is the Mariana Trench\r\n++ Everyone hates their job. The fact of the mater is this job is not rewarding, not intriguing and everyone is being treated like a child. There are rules about where one can eat lunch. There are rules when you can and can't go to the toilet. The job is so repetitive that you might as well work on a conveyor belt packing boxes all day long. There is no praise for doing a job well but a telling off reaches you faster then lightning when you make a mistake. There is a difference about being told off by your mentor who showed you how to do it but you still messed up and being told off by someone who hasn't been in your shoes even for a day. This is like a pilot being told by a passenger how to fly a plane\r\n\r\n- Management seems to be oblivious to the state of affairs\r\n++ No one stays here for a long time and no one seems to be asking any questions why so many people are leaving. Good people who have ambitions and want a rewarding career are running for the hills after a few months of 'doing time'. As long as the stats are showing the right numbers everything is fine. Team meetings are a one way discussion, you're told whats going to happen next and if you have any suggestions for improvement make a wish and it may come true. You feel like you're just a number and your job is not to provide input - your job is to carry out orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis place needs a serious shake up. In any role, doesn't matter what the job is, if the people are not happy you will not get much productivity from them.

She says a lot, does nothing.\r\n\r\nBesides, why would she and her cronies listen anyway, they know everything already and believe their own carefully manipulated stats and ignore the fact that their new model just won\u2019t - and already doesn\u2019t - work on a blanket approach. Their \u2018answer in room\u2019 concept is more like \u2018the answer is in the building\u2026somewhere, if you know who to ask. But don\u2019t worry too much about finding it, because we need to do things quickly, not properly.\u2019\r\n\r\nFor a bit longer, you have specialist teams dealing with complaints. Soon, under \u2018the new plan\u2019, it\u2019ll be sloppy rubbish being churned out to meet the targets by people who don't understand what it is they're selling (saying and/or writing). It is already, I\u2019ve seen it. You can't effectively answer a person's query or complaint if you don't first understand that complaint.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the people/grunts who have been around a while can see the reality of the situation. Many of the newer people - the ones almost straight out of uni, wide eyed and quick to swallow whatever it is they\u2019re told - are happy to be sheep. Or the new investigators, same thing really.\r\n\r\nYou have investigators who are inexperienced being led by managers and ombudsman, some of whom bend over backwards to uphold complaints. Fair anyone? Nope, but it happens anyway. If you get an MP involved, surprise! The complaint will either be in jurisdiction or upheld. It\u2019s about pandering to the public. Do you like us? Aww, go on, like us\u2026 Give us good feedback so we can tell everyone how great and \u2018relevant\u2019 we are\u2026\r\n\r\nMany of the new investigators aren\u2019t experienced in dealing with complaints and some haven\u2019t even dealt with them before. Ok, everyone has to start somewhere. But, basically, many people just applied for these roles because it gave them an instant pay increase. Or, like now, they\u2019re scared they\u2019ll lose their jobs or end up in PPI. However, the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to dealing with complaints will, of course, work regardless of these little (read - big) concerns.\r\n\r\nThe Ombudsman Service is happy for its experienced people to leave. Why would they not; they have answers, experience but cost more than someone in their first job out of education. In fact, they\u2019re more or less advocating this by shoving anyone who doesn\u2019t apply for the new format into PPI - the [almost] end of the road. You\u2019re either with us or not, and if you\u2019re not, then well, we don\u2019t care about you. \r\n\r\nPPI is dull, boring and has a shelf life. With the annual staff turnover recently being in the 20% plus area, it won\u2019t be long before \u2018the undesirables\u2019 leave of their own accord. Saves paying them redundancy then as this is cheaper and means more money for the old boys club to spend on their own fat salaries and pay rises.\r\n\r\nAnd, I can\u2019t not mention appraisals.\r\n\r\nDo you want to be appraised fairly? If you do, don\u2019t work at the Ombudsman Service.\r\n\r\nThe new appraisal system is just like the new way of working - sloppy, under thought and, of course not reflective of the truth.\r\n\r\nWe now have three grades to be judged on - [effectively] underperforming, adequate or simply amazing. \r\n\r\nThe first two are self explanatory. The third one basically means in order to get that grade you have to be doing so much other stuff as you\u2019re almost doing two people\u2019s work. So, most people won\u2019t get it. \r\n\r\nThe obvious flaw here is that you can be just scraping by as adequate or doing really well but not enough to get the top grade and you\u2019ll get the same result, and pay rise. Fair? Of course not. Why bother working hard or making extra effort when the guy next to you doing just above what they need to will get the same reward? But it does make it easier to bundle everyone together and keep the pay rises down to a minimum. Also, if you do manage to stay for a long time, you\u2019ll get a lower pay rise than the people who have just started. Again, fair anyone? Nothing like rewarding experienced long standing staff.\r\n\r\nSo are you interested in working at the Financial Ombudsman Service? \r\n\r\nWould anyone let a person who can\u2019t see drive them down the road? No. But that\u2019s exactly what is going on at the Financial Ombudsman Service. The staff all know it, but the management just ignore it. The fact that there has been a massive increase of reviews on this site - which they hate as they can\u2019t control it or happily brush it aside - and the tone of these reviews, says volumes. Read them all. If a place really isn\u2019t so bad, why have so many people said the same thing about it being a shambles? Why are the reviews increasing so much?\r\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019re a business or a person on the street, expect a slap-dash approach to your complaint going forward, because that\u2019s what\u2019s coming to you in 2017 and beyond. There\u2019s a car crash on the horizon folks, and it\u2019s getting nearer all the time. Don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Why no changes to senior management team?", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "13 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Team Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Non-salary benefits are good.

By senior level I mean board & executive level, directors of casework and head of levels.  This applies across all departments in the  organisation including  the inept Stakeholder Team.\r\n\r\nIt's clear many staff ridicule senior management. And this has rapidly turned to disgust because the quality of senior management hasn't improved and there has been zero accountability of senior managers demonstrated. Unfortunately, there\u2019s precious little evidence that incompetence (including in the Stakeholder Team) has been dealt with. It\u2019s clear that staff attitude to senior management has deteriorated from ridicule \u2013 to disgust and in some instances, contempt. Why?  Because they just carry on without any challenge or sanction. How do all the executives, directors of casework and heads of retain their highly paid jobs? It\u2019s really quite astonishing. I think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve all got each other\u2019s backs. They know they can't risk be taken on by other organisations and would lose massive salaries that they\u2019d never have achieved with any other employers.  \r\n\r\nThere have been strong indicators for several years that the ability of senior management has been lacking. The evidence and indicators were clear. For example - poor feedback in staff engagement surveys, abysmal feedback from focus groups, high staff turnover, dreadful reviews on Glassdoor, the publicly available independent report commissioned following the embarrassing Dispatches documentary and now the concern expressed by the Treasury Select Committee.  And yet many unqualified, inexperienced and incompetent senior managers carry on regardless.  It's quite obvious our CEO needs to undertake a wide ranging shake-up of her executive team and other senior mangers. \r\n\r\nThere are now some doomed attempts to pull the service out of its nose dive. For all our sakes let\u2019s hope they work. But surely you don\u2019t then leave the executives and senior management whose misjudgements caused the mess in the first place, to remain in post. No wonder many staff feel contempt towards lots of them. Move some on for all our sakes; our CEO and Chairman must demonstrate they won\u2019t tolerate individuals whose incompetence has let them down so badly. Replace them with dynamic, forward thinking, academically and managerially qualified people who have proven track records of turning failing organisations round.

Good people around you. Good challenging work (that the new model STILL isn\u2019t in a position to handle).", "cons": "I\u2019m surprised there haven\u2019t been any reviews about how management have decided to press ahead with redundancies. Forcing the specialist adjudicators - who are working hard to support the untrained investigators - and ombudsmen to choose between a future in \u2018mass claims\u2019 or voluntary redundancy. With the latter having the added threat that you can never work for FOS again if you take it. And this is despite an employment tribunal stating that moving people to mass claims is effectively constructive dismissal and that the result of the independent review is due out any day now\r\n\r\nBut what I\u2019d like to say is that there is no recognition for the adjudicators and ombudsmen who, mostly, feel real value in what they do and are working hard to prop up a failing model. There certainly isn\u2019t any slacking in the \u2018transition\u2019 area. The adjudicators are on full targets and a lot are also fielding calls from investigators about the basics of all products and doing other things like sifting cases, which the new world hasn\u2019t factored in. All of this, despite being told that we\u2019re not seen as part of the organisation\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nI genuinely mean no disrespect to the investigators - they\u2019ve been put into a situation that isn\u2019t their fault - but someone with no Portfolio Management experience handling complaints from serious and often very knowledgeable investors isn\u2019t going to work. My colleagues in pensions say the same thing - even the lesser experienced pensions adjudicators need help from the more senior adjudicators. So how did the management expect investigators to get up to speed within two years? It certainly hasn\u2019t worked. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the same in my area. They\u2019ve put people into 70/30 pods where they\u2019ll be specialising (sorry, focussing on certain products) for 30% of their time. But if they\u2019re doing other cases for 70% of the time, how will they be able to provide swift answers to more complex cases. I can do things quickly, but that\u2019s because I deal with the same issues everyday.\r\n\r\nThe new model doesn\u2019t have the capacity (I heard it is behind in its productivity and that another department-customer help is having to take on the postal complaints as the new model hasn\u2019t got the staff). My friends who became investigators tell me that they are under extreme pressure and that, despite what we are told by managers, they are finding shortcuts to closing cases. For example the right to have an ombudsman reconsider the case is conveniently missed out by some investigators, making it look like their answer is the final answer. That\u2019s because a referral takes more time and doesn\u2019t result in a closure because of the time it takes to get a decision.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s another point. The original model envisaged the highly paid team manager (now known as an ombudsman manager) to look at and provide final decisions for cases where their team were unable to resolve the matter. This isn\u2019t happening as they (mostly) spend more time on managing the team and not being an \u2018ombudsman\u2019.\r\n\r\nSo returning to my original point. Despite having people who are capable and willing to carry on \u2018helping our customers\u2019 where they have an expertise, the service seems intent on moving us to deal with short term lending or PPI or making us apply for voluntary redundancy.  The decision making skills defy belief and they are so out of touch with what is actually happening.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, additional complaints are only being resolved because of incentive schemes. Currently an additional few weeks target will be paid at a time and a half. But in the ten weeks before the end of the financial year we were paid double time to try and get us near the figures needed to be able to justify the new model. None of that was in the annual report!!! The service didn\u2019t hit the overall target (they blamed PPI uncertainty again), but we got paid nicely for some easy work - which the investigation model should (as the leadership team announced two or more years ago) have been more than capable of doing. Again, this isn\u2019t the fault of the individual investigators, it\u2019s the situation they\u2019ve been put into. \r\n\r\nTo those who are happy in the investigator role, I\u2019m pleased for you. I really am because it does suit some people. But I hear more negativity than positivity from the area about what the senior management (above OL) expect. And please don\u2019t refer to adjudicators as slackers or moaners. We\u2019re not! We\u2019re trying to do a similar job to you (just without the phones and setting up of cases). We\u2019ve got full targets and are providing support. Next time you or a colleague calls one of the helplines, imagine what it will be like for you/them when we aren\u2019t there.

The new system has left existing staff bemused because it simply can't work.

The idea is that you can find someone who has the answers but how does that help the customer who wants help from someone who at least sounds like they know what they're talking about?\r\n\r\nPeople appreciate there needs to be some change but the complaints aren't going to get easier. The experienced staff have historically been undervalued but now they're being tossed aside completely. they're simply unwanted and don't fit any longer and the new roles are a way to weed out anyone who's too old or too well paid, the salary cap will see to that.\r\n\r\nThe way organisation expects to work in future is simply unrealistic in view of the types of issues it deals with. The current investigators are already findings themselves out of their depth on such a range of products but dare not speak up. Sooner or later they'll realise that the old system wasn't that far off the mark and could have been refined but how much damage will be done by then when customers who want to speak to experts get someone who can do nothing more than listen and cross their fingers they'll be able to deal with the problem eventually."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Getting worse and worse", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are some niche areas where the work will allow you to develop some new skills and experience.

They have made a number of very poor ill thought out decisions and ran with them with no accountability. The appetite to change is due to poor financial decisions of the past - largely due to a top heavy structure where there are loads of senior staff who do nothing or other poor decisions e.g. even though the organisations was moving offices in 2014 - that same year it paid hundreds of thousands to upgrade the board room to make it look like a hipster cafe. The board table was designer and each of the chairs were also individually made by designers and that alone was rumored to have cost in the 10's of thousands. No idea what happened to all this but it wasn't moved over to the new building. \r\n\r\nThe most frustrating thing when i was there was that that was masqueraded as helping progression made it much harder for people to progress and also reduced all the overall salaries for anyone new coming into the organisation. Alongside this, the senior staff (largely who used to be the old football team) kept getting promoted and inventing new jobs for themselves. For example, one of their mates was alleged to be promoting attractive females who flirted (or allegedly more) with him and when this all came out he was promoted to an ombudsman - despite not being all that bright. \r\n\r\nIt's a massive shame because the idea of the organisation was good but now it just isn't fit for purpose and the real losers are the lower level staff who work there and also the consumers that turn to it for help. The organisation simply doesn't have the specialist knowledge it used to because people are leaving or because new changes expect staff to deal with complaints from all areas rather than specialist areas. E.g. the same adjudicators (or investigators) and ombudsman will look at consumer credit, pension and insurance complaints. It took me about 2 years before i got the hang of consumer credit alone. \r\n\r\nUnless you have no other options i wouldn't work here.

That has massive implications for performance - which appears below par - with the direction of travel changing depending on which way the Borg determines the wind blows. There is a nod to a set of values and behaviours that differ markedly between the said and the done, e.g. 'listen', which seems to only apply to customers not to a core principle for the Borg with its crew. If they did they may realise there are some really excellent people out there with excellent ideas but they may be challenging to manage BECAUSE they have brains and ideas. e.g 'fair', which certainly does not seem to apply to many of the selection and promotion processes, nor to how people are treated who might dare to ask, 'why?' or may have a passion for excellence and know what it can look like because they have brought in their expertise from other organisations that DO have that passion.\r\n\r\nDon't expect one culture.

Or to even justify 25 appointments. Millions of pounds have been spent employing contractors while there isn't enough work to go round permanent staff.

People will get quick, wrong answers from inexperienced staff who don't know what they're doing.\r\n\r\nThe current rumours circulating are that the organisation is going to reduce the amount of redundancy pay in order to save money when the inevitable redundancies come. If so, the executive and board should be ashamed of themselves. It would demonstrate yet again that they absolutely do not care about their hard-working staff.

I have never felt so degraded, under-appreciated or monitored as I did at the FOS. It is common practice for managers to monitor all their staff do and if someone has little or no activity for 20 minutes on the case-handling system they ask that person to give a detailed account of everything they've done for the last 20 minutes. There is an inherent assumption that everyone they employ is trying to not work and do their job. Managers are more like prison guards. The management also talk down to all staff, and everyone is expected to be in awe of everyone who is senior to them.
