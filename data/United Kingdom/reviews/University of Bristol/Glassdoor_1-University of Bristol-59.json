The uni is very much a business and therefore quality for teaching provision is cut at every corner possible. This also is leading to insane student numbers. They want the education to be mass produced and have no concerns regarding the student experience on that front. As a business their model is have a shiny superficial face for student tours but one scratch below the surface and the buildings are in poor and very outdated states. People of poorer character are often the ones to be rewarded with promotions, they want people who toe the line and will be the hench men of the powers that be. Leads to a very strong culture of mid level management and above listening to reply, never to understand. Progression within your role is about as painful as it can be. I have seen colleagues have to apply for the job they are already doing three times and get rejected. They have had to do this because progression within your own job is essentially impossible. With that in mind, the uni is very keen on maintaining its Ivory Tower ways and very well experienced academics get passed over for jobs they are already doing in favour of people with PhDs but little to no experience. The academics without PhDs are facing a future of very stunted progression regardless of excelling at their jobs because they don't have a title. The student recruitment process is still resulting in the scale always tipping heavily towards white students from very privileged backgrounds. The students not in this category are the minority and are well aware of that fact and will report back about how obvious it is and how uncomfortable being an outsider is. Due to how elitist the senior management is with staff progression, it is unsurprising the attainment of students still appears very classist. I have never seen a maternity cover hire once in my years at UoB. When someone goes on matleave, the management just expect you to pick up everything without any help. Its extraordinary considering how much they want Athena Swan prizes. The NSS results matter far more than anything else, for better or worse. The work culture is extremely toxic now and most of my coworkers and I are very stressed out, genuinely quite hurt and burnt out."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Overworked staff, tired buildings", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "29 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Senior Research Associate in Bristol, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "City centre location with beautiful gardens at the top of St. Michael's Hill", "cons": "The Biomedical Sciences Building is literally falling apart and the university will not address it.
