It's not one-off consultancy programmes but long engagement with an issue over many projects and many years. They bring together the knowledge of how to pull in funding, build a coalition, design new ways of working, and stay with the new model over the years it takes to deliver and scale.\r\n\r\nThe organisation's focus is hard to define - Directors added over time have launched initiatives in policy areas from end-of-life-care to bonded labor to school exclusions. I see that as a positive - a group of small teams sharing resources, a culture and a space rather one focused organisation.\r\n\r\nThe organisation's capabilities are similarly diverse. I think of it as essentially entrepreneurial work - establishing what needs to happen and getting the pieces in place. Key skills enabling that are strategy, corporate finance, product management, data science, fundraising, and building/running partnerships.\r\n\r\nGreat examples of the work are Drive (focused on domestic violence), the creation and spreading of Social Impact Bonds, and the digital team's work to make data science useful and ethical in children's social care.\r\n\r\nThe people are great - huge intellects, interesting experience, collaborative, and in it for the right reasons.", "cons": "The somewhat fragmented nature of the organisation can make navigating it a bit hard if you lack confidence working informally.
