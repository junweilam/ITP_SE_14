The allowence offered is not enough for train fare so I had to get a bus, this took 6 hours. I travelled through the night so I would be there for 9am. The assessment Centre was fine although I was the only working class person there, also the only Northern person. By the time I got the bus home I had been awake for over 48 hours and had been unable to afford food/drink for the journey. I was turned down as a candidate, which is fine. What I was uncomfortable with was the feedback I received. They explained that I passed the interview and I delivered a great lesson with appropriate material and confidence. But... 'I looked tired' (unable to afford train or hotel) and 'sometimes the panel struggled to understand what I was saying' (working-class accent). That was it, those were the reasons I was not considered as having the potential to become a teacher. Ironic thing is, I wanted to work at a school in my own area, the children would have had accents like mine. I would have been from a background like many of them which would hopefully show them that they too can go to university, which is supposed to be what teach first is about? Instead it is likely that a privately educated well spoken young person will take that place. Teaching kids that if they want to succeed they should become more middle class. I decided to take up a PhD studentship instead, researching class based discrimination in education. Teach First is often an example I use when teaching undergraduate students. Sometimes even the best intentions are clouded by a deeply rooted subconscious bias. It's in the very name of the organisation Teach underprivileged kids First, do something better later. Involving more people that share a background with these children may equate to teaching for life, not just first. I had worked for Teach First for a few years prior to this, promoting their schemes to high achieving students. Had I had this experience first, I would have been clear that this scheme is best suited to middle class students who would like to spend a couple of years amongst working class kids before going on to do something else."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Rigorous but rewarding", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jun 2023", "job_title": "English Teacher in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- consistent support online and in person - PGDE attained at the end of the two years - assignments enhance practice in the classroom - excellent network opportunities", "cons": "- heavy workload - additional support depends on school"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Hard work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Teacher in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Do not go into teaching unless you are committed.", "cons": "Long days, no lunch break, no loo break, 60 hour weeks"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great mission but can feel like you are cannon fodder", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "31 May 2023", "job_title": "Teacher in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "If you are lucky you get great professional mentors and a supportive school - its all luck of the draw", "cons": "Teaching is extremely demanding and teach first is no different"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good but hard work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Teacher in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great support Good resources Student discounts", "cons": "Extremely overworked Fyll time student and full time teacher"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Shah", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Secondary Teacher in Newcastle upon Tyne, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Being paid whilst doing your training", "cons": "Poor pay and a significant workload"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Passionate people, great benefits", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Engagement Department in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The charity is filled with passionate, talented and dedicated people, who strive for an education system that works for every child, and support our community.
