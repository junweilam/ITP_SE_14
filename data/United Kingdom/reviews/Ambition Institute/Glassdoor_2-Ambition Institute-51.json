There is no pay for the guaranteed overtime that each staff member has to do, the pay disparities by race and gender are a huge problem with people secretly getting a pay rises to even out the data before it is released to the public. No clear pathway for pay rises with favourites being given pay rises and other extremely hard-working staff who go above and beyond being turned down due to budget. \r\n\r\n-Progression \u2013 there is what appears to be a linear line from entering as an associate, progressing to senior associate, to then manager and then getting to director level. Things are not what they seem, with promotions internally being based of who you know and if your line manager puts in a good word for you, without these things\u2019 promotions are extremely hard to get. \r\n\r\n- Training - there are no streamlined training support given to new starters on how to use the systems and what is expected or for new line managers who can have teams of 7+ with no line management experience, it really is sink or swim. \r\n\r\n-\tDiversity and inclusion \u2013 there are several network groups for protected characteristics, for example LGBTQ, BAME, Women\u2019s. Yet these are run by lower staff for no extra pay, recognition, possible promotion or support. Plus, there is no training to be a network lead unless forcibly begging for it. Hilary the CEO attends monthly meetings with all networks leads however no real actions for change that are suggested by the leads is ever taken into account, instead the new culture director steals these ideas and passes them off as her own. (You know who you are!)\r\nThere are several other internal and external groups that are lead by directors, staff get great updates on the discussions that have taken place, yet no tangible action for improvement is ever made. This is probably because the D&I team are made up of white middle class employees who don\u2019t think that tangible change is needed. \r\n\r\n-\tReviews \u2013 these Glassdoor reviews have been a huge contention for internal staff, with old employees asked to write positive reviews of Ambition to offset all the negative, so be careful what positive reviews you trust about Ambition. The main reason for this was that funders were worried about the severe level of negative reviews, however the negative reviews reflect the real internal workings. \r\n\r\n-\tDirector level and above \u2013 as noted directors often steal work and take credit, speak horrendously about other staff members and expect everyone to often work 10+ hour days. However, they themselves are subject to pressure from above and are often online at 10pm onwards just trying to keep a float.\r\n\r\n-\tHR \u2013 the ever criticised HR Team, do try their best, however with the level of staff turn over in that department it is hard to keep up, as well as the resistance from the CEO to actually make any improvements to the company. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am thrilled to say I no longer work here, it was great to start with but then when the illusion fell it was clear that this is a company that has no clear direction, changes focus and strategy every year (future teachers, middle leadership programme, Apprentices , NPQS, ECT\u2026the list could go on). As well as changing names and branding each year (Future Teachers, Ambition School Leadership, Ambition Institute). \r\nIf you want to work in the Education and charity section, look elsewhere, if you are a young 20 something and just want a job to get you by then this is the place as there is no long term reward or support to stay long term. \r\nBe warned though that you may have to work ridiculous hours, your ideas probably will be stolen and passed off as someone else's, you may have complaints filled against you just for giving ideas that are then stolen by others and you will probably be spoken down to and at some point made cry at the complete mess that is Ambition Institute\u2026.hopefully this review helps internal and potential employers to look else where."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great company to work for but poor career progression", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Tutor in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent culture of teamwork and support.

In my final 2 years, they treated me dreadfully, and I can\u2019t recommend enough that you do everything you can to avoid working there. There are several issues I want to draw attention too, many of which have been touched upon by other posters: \r\n\r\n1.\tToxic culture since the merger \r\nSince the merger of Ambition School Leadership and Institute of Teaching, there has been a dreadful culture. Of course, it is hard to unite opposing ideologies (even intentionally!), but instead, IfT began by being oppositional to Ambition School Leadership. In particular, IfT staff were encouraged to view Ambition School Leadership staff critically, which planted seeds amongst the IfT staff not to trust Ambition staff, and to view their work as sub-par. When I have worked with individuals in many instances, I built good relationships. However, the bad culture still exists between these teams- namely: the current design team and the programmes that fall under the 'teaching' programmes umbrella vs all other teams within the organisation. These teams work with the rest of the organisation in a conflictual manner, either micromanaging work, advising on areas outside of their expertise, or trying to take on responsibilities that doesn't sit within their functions. \r\n\r\n2.\tNo viable operating model, or organisational strategy \r\nThe organisation has been running into a deficit each year (which you can see publically on companies house). In spite of this, there has been no clear strategy to address this. These issues lead to continual organisational restructures (3 in the last 2 years), where senior staff are protected and junior staff let go, in spite of where there is evidence to the contrary about who does the work. E.g. the School Partnerships team removed all junior-level postings this year, with no evidence on why this was a better model. \r\n\r\n3.\tIncompetent CEO \r\nHilary has shown absolutely no organisational leadership since joining the organisation and is clearly out of her depth. For a while, it was hoped that she was holding her cards to her chest while finding her feet, but unfortunately, she has not made decisive action on any area and continued to oversee an organisation with no model, and a terrible culture. Only with new leadership can Ambition improve. \r\n\r\n4.\tUnethical & incompetent HR \r\nThis year my job was coming to an end, as it was a maternity cover contract. The organisation decided to place me in a redeployment pool, which means any suitable role that came up, I would be considered first as a candidate. When a new hire was announced one day, I asked HR why I hadn\u2019t been able to apply for the role, they told me the internal intranet post, was the first they had heard of the vacancy, and said it was \u2018out of their hands\u2019. I was then called by an exec director who explained it was just a \u20183 month\u2019 posting, which is why it didn\u2019t go through due process. This was in direct contradiction to the postholder, who said in a call with me that she was expected to be here until December (9 months at the time- going well beyond my contract end date). This postholder is still employed. \r\n\r\nWhen I complained formally about this, I was lied to repeatedly by HR and leadership. The complaint put me out of favor of the organisation, and when suitable posts did come up, the process was predetermined so that I was unsuccessful. When I emailed Hilary to discuss these issues she ignored me on several occasions. \r\n\r\nWhilst there is one particular good HR employee (Janine) and perhaps others in HR are trying to influence the organisation to do better, the fact that the organisational leadership is not listening to the advice of HR (or the law), nor providing enough resource for it (for instance they have not backfilled the role of HR director) shows how little they respect HR. \r\n\r\nNow when you read this, you may just think I am a \u2018disgruntled\u2019 employee, but it is not just me that feels this way. The results of the staff survey that came out this year compared us with other charities. Across most metrics we were in the bottom quartile, yet Ambition took no action to respond to the feedback."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Great people, clueless leadership", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Human Resources Advisor in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues and flexibility of work", "cons": "Leadership who do not listen"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Very nice people and organisation", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jan 2021", "job_title": "Junior Project Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good work life balance, very helpful people, 11% pension contribution from employer", "cons": "Depending on the position salaries can be quite low, but it is a charity after all."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Fantastic people and training opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Jun 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In the short time I have worked here I have had multiple training opportunities as well as the chance to stretch and develop my skills with great support from my line manager.

Since the merger, the workload has again increased substantially and the obsession with performance management targets is truly suffocating and counterproductive.  \r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that the pay of roles advertised is substantially lower than when I started at the end of 2015, whereas expectations and the workload has increased.  Internal promotion opportunities have also dried up considerably. A classic case of layers of management who have done enough boot-licking up to middle and senior management only to subsequently knock the ladder down behind them and having no shame in throwing those below them under the bus.\r\n\r\nMorale across the organisation is palpably low. The internal propaganda machine which  shovels disingenuous talk of 'values', 'mission' and 'moral purpose' down our throats has worn thin, especially as since the merger it is painstakingly and cringeworthilly conceited and inauthentic.  Comparison with North Korea or the Soviet Union always comes to mind, however outrageously hyperbolic, but this is a five year plan that needs abolishing.\r\n\r\nThe HR department are grossly incompetent to the point of countless breaches of employment law, Careless confidentiality breaches of sensitive employer information littered on it's shared drive and around the office printer.\r\n\r\nI do believe, especially on the Future Leaders side there used to be heart to what we were trying to achieve. It's probably no coincidence that problems have been mounting as the focus has shifted relentlessly to chasing money.\r\n\r\nI hope these are teething problems with establishing a new organisation but to ambitious, morally-driven graduates and those early on in their career, I'd advise staying well away if you can help it, for now at least.
