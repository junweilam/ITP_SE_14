Many staff members are unhappy, burnt out or struggling with work related stress and anxiety. This comes from the working culture set by the Senior Leadership Team within fundraising at Mencap. Also there are several SLT members with multiple grievances against them, none of which ever seem to amount to anything. Also SLT do not listen to staff who are unhappy, or made any effort to change these cultural issues that affect staff turnover and happiness. It does not fit in with the charity 'values' of being 'kind' and 'inclusive'. \n\n. It is an incredibly hierarchical management structure with little room for creativity and freedom to fail within fundraising.

As a support worker who does sleep in's and lone working, you basically end up running the place. If there's a medication error which often happens with staff doing a 24 hour shift, you deal with the problem even though you barely have enough time to get everything else done and look after the residents. If a staff member rings in sick you are expected to find cover. You as a support worker will do meds, finances, personal care, cooking, cleaning, arranging appointments, answering the telephone, filling out risk assessments, incident forms, care plans, finance files, medication files, daily records and many more documentation. I as a support worker was responsible for looking after/supporting 4-5 adults from 2.15pm-2.15pm the next day. You can ring management in office hours mon-fri but this is only if you really need to, as was explained to me by the manager 'not if someone run's out of macragol'. Also if someone doesn't turn up to their sleep shift to take you off, you are expected to stay until they can get cover.\r\nLong shifts, sleeps, lone working\r\nNo food or drink allowance when supporting someone out to a pub/restaurant (you sit there with tap water unless you are willing to spend your own money) \r\nAgain no motivation or support from management, they very rarely come to the service and when doing so they do not say hello or speak to staff, they instead stay in the office and write in a communication book to staff to read instead of telling them face to face. On my last day my manager ignored me. You have to seek out the manager, they will not come to you to even check on staff or communicate with them.\r\nA big con is also that if anyone is unhappy about mencap in any area it is seen as being negative rather than a genuine different view. The media side to mencap is extremely good and proficient, again so much so they will deny, refute, try to reason or explain to keep their good image. Mencap do alot of good campaigning and giving advise and information to those with a learning disability, it's a real shame that the residentail/supported living side is let down.\r\nAnother con would be how incredibly strict they are, this sounds like a good thing but in reality they are too strict so much so it is silly. For example, you are not allowed to refer to service users by their nicknames even though this is what they like to be called, respond to and what is written in their support plans. Another example is being declined for a job because you live too close to the residential service, by too close I'm not talking about round the corner either.\r\nTo conclude I really wouldn't recommend working for mencap, there are so much better companies to work for."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Could do better", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Support Worker in Wallingford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people you support for this company are amazing!
