A small team in 1st line support, i found colleagues not answering phone calls and handling a very low number of tickets in a month. Expect about 1500 tickets each month, but don't be surprised if colleagues work on around 100.\r\nThis has a knock on effect where you will regularly, and quite rightly, be bombarded by customers who's tickets have not been looked at in 3 months. I found myself constantly apologising for this to the customers which is highly draining.\r\nSenior management seem to have little interest in the helpdesk and reaching out to them is pointless. You do have a team lead but, the university refuses to appoint a manager and takes little interest in the team leads ideas, \r\nTo impact further, other teams make ridiculous changes without a care in the world of the inevitable impact this has on the helpdesk. You will spend your time picking up the pieces for other IT teams failings. An example of this being the disabling of printers due to printnightmare. Although dealt with by microsoft within 1 week, still the poor management of this means users have no printing.\r\nService downtime seems to occur randomly. you can be working on a busy shift and your essential software goes down due to an update implemented by a team in DTS. No thought goes in to the co-ordination of this.\r\nTo add to the issues, the university announced a pay freeze. This was announced by an email asking if you are willing to accept a pay freeze for the next 2 years. When enquiring what happens when you say no, you are told they will end your contract and reissue you a new one on the new terms.
