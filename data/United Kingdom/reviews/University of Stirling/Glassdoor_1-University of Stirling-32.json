If it was a school inspection the team would be removed and the school put in special measures. Management staff are obsessed with titles and embellishing their email signatures. On the whole their is a deficit of experience within the management team and schoolboy errors are routinely made that could be avoided if they opted for a positive and consultative approach rather than ramming things through that were tried and failed years previously. Within the team it has been known that frontline accomadation staff are turning to food banks to feed themselves due to the low rates of depressed pay. This at a time when the management team has grown 50% in size. Stacking shelves in Tesco or washing cars pays the same these days without the grief and victimisation experienced here. The atmosphere is unhealthy and there is a lot of favourites. A large proportion of staff are related to each other like a family firm with all the issues that entails. Nobody competent would ever be promoted that would embarrass the Head, it\u2019s all micromanaged badly with no decisions approved until the dear leader rubber stamps them. This is to the detriment of the buildings which have been starved of investment in recent times, managers and Directors don\u2019t notice as they are pretty much welded to there office chairs."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Receptionist in Stirling, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great working here.
