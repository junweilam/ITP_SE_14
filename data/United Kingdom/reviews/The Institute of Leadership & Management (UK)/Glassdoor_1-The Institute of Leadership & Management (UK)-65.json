We have extensive workplace benefits, including access to private healthcare, competitive pension, up to 30 holiday days and additional days off at Christmas. I work remotely and have full autonomy over my work-life balance and my workload. The culture at The Institute means that you can take an idea and run with it, exploring the ramifications without being beholden to the constraints of a more traditional, hierarchical organisation. Our focus on agility means that the pace can be fast, but we also have freedom to fail. We also do an astounding amount of work to support our culture, including an internal net promoter score and resolution focused policies. More importantly, I feel able to be honest with the Senior Leadership Team and CEO, without fear of reprisal or negativity. We aren't perfect, but I genuinely believe that my colleagues are passionate about the work that they do, have good intentions and deeply care for the organisation.
