A further advantage of this role is that it assists with confidence building and teamwork as the venue can only operate if the entire staff contingent was contributing to assisting the Manager and therefore each staff member was contributing to the success of the venue. There are multiple venues around Scotland the U.K which are located in the major University cities and the facilities they offer such as swimming pools and cavernous sports halls plus rock climbing in one venue. As a coach is seen as a role model for the children they persistently desire to challenge themselves by beating them in the games so being magnanimous in defeat helps to see that they are developing in their progression in a sport and encourages children to continue this outside of their time in Kings. Should a coach be seen to possess what is regarded as the \"Kings Factor\" they are offered leadership training and phased promotion to lead their own staff and venue which suggests recognition for their ability and dedication to the company, however non-financial awards are distributed weekly to the best staff member recognised by the Area Manager.  The CEO of the charity Richard Holmes was one of the original founders and currently still is heavily involved with the operations of it which is a testament to belief of the business model and is held in high esteem by current and former members of staff for his Leadership Style and personal involvement with its operation. He makes it a personal mission to visit each and every venue during the Summer operations to ensure that the staff and venue conform to the expectations that he expects from his staff base. This charity employs a system were trainee coaches or Rookies are trained by experienced members of staff till they are old enough to be given their own group upon their successful graduation. As these children then become the next generation of coaches over time this leadership programme gives those children an insight into the role of a sports coach should they wish to pursue a career of this over time.", "cons": "As much as this job has many positive aspects there are ones which I think that are negative. Although this is a sports camp the hours can be quite long working from 8-6 at some days playing sport continuously while having to multi-task for other operations. This role is contract based to each year and there is no guarantee of continued sustained work from season after season with no valid reason as so why a coach or manager will be dismissed apart from simply being told so retention of experienced staff can be an issue.  Those who fit a certain criteria are given immediate promotion to Site Manager which has lead to problems of inexperience disrupting the operation of the venue and resentment of experienced staff being overlooked for promotion."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best job I have had in years!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2018", "job_title": "Head Office Employee in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people in the office, working along such friendly and helpful people.
