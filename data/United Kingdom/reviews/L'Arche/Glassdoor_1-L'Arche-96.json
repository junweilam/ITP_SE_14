Prattle on about \"faith\" yet are nasty more often than not. Revelations about Vanier very sad and tragic but in a way not unsurprising; for example, if a colleague expresses romantic interest in a co-worker, it is assumed the co-worker should fall over themselves with gratitude and happiness at the attention, and if the colleague is ignored (perhaps you have no interest in a romantic relationship) then passive aggressive destruction of your character will begin - cowardly actions to be fair. Overall, not that much of a stretch from that mentality to the heinous actions of Jean Vanier - \"God has placed us both here etc.\" Very disturbing to contemplate!"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Canterbury, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very good company I like it", "cons": "They are good nothing bad"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Supportive HR", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great for those who love Community.
