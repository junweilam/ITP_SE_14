All seems extremely positive at the beginning however as soon as you\u2019re on your team taking calls it quickly turns into a less pleasant/more stressful experience. My first con is as a customer experience specialist you\u2019re dealing with complaints/customers complaining practically all day, however have very little scope or the tools to help which is frustrating for the customer and the staff member. You\u2019re criticised and marked down on your call gradings for phoning third parties and going the extra mile to help, as this affects your stats, even though you\u2019re told in training to use your own empowerment and do what\u2019s best for the customer. You feel like you can\u2019t win. If the customer wants to escalate their complaint there are then a couple of further teams you can raise them to which is a confusing process in itself, but the customer will have to wait a further day for a call back which frustrates them even more. I\u2019ve never worked in \u2018customer service\u2019 where the \u2018customer service advisor\u2019 can\u2019t just resolve it all on the first call- surely that\u2019s the whole point of a customer service team? It feels unproductive passing the customer from pillar to post. Secondly the company preaches about how it\u2019s supportive of mental health, however it seems to be that the job is actually the thing having a negative affect on people\u2019s mental health. You\u2019re run into the ground taking calls back to back and they\u2019re even now potentially removing the natural wrap time so you\u2019re immediately put back into a call. The managers don\u2019t realise how mentally draining the calls can be and sometimes you need a minute to breathe and de-stress inbetween customers. The managers and coaches seem to try and morph you into some type of Motability Robot, sounding the same as everyone else. My manager compared me to someone who had worked there for years when I had worked there for one month saying \u2018you should aim to be like ****\u2019 which is an unhealthy approach and made me felt like I was being forced to sound differently on the phone, as I wanted to do what was expected of me to pass my probation. I\u2019ve been pulled up on accidentally logging in 1 minute late or accidentally calling a customer by their first name, numerous other petty things but ultimately I\u2019m only human. You\u2019re made to feel like a child not treated as an adult. Not to mention someone I know of who had mental health related absence during probation so she was let go of. To summarise, MO doesn\u2019t practice what it preaches in terms of mental health. There are a few other annoyances of the role, during probation being expected to listen into calls in your own time after work and unpaid. When you finish at 19:00 and on a Saturday not actually being able to log out until everyone is out of the queue and it\u2019s closed off and a manager emails everyone (which can take up to 5 minutes every day and you don\u2019t get the time back, but it all adds up). They\u2019re quick to pull you up about coming back from your lunch 1 minute late but happily expect you to stay 3 minutes every late/Saturday after work until they close the phone lines. Having no time or phone code to read through emails during the working day, so you can miss important information but can\u2019t do anything about that because you\u2019re always expected to be taking calls."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good if your face fits.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Contact Center Agent in Bristol, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Salary and benefits, some lovely people", "cons": "Targets, favouritism, managers and coaches not held to account for their mistakes"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work, happy environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Customer Service in Bristol, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great recruitment process, thorough due to naturally wanting empathetic and caring individuals for this role, clear and informative throughout, really enjoyed the training and academy - although scared to deal with that first call, the support and guidance was second to none !!, the people are unbelievably friendly, I am really happy here !!", "cons": "the building heating can be on and off at times"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Doesn't practice what it preaches, would not recommend", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Customer Experience Specialist in Bristol, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "*Good Pay for role type (Excellent yearly Bonuses if your face fits) *Good benefits package *Free Coffee Shop *Reduced Priced Canteen *Excellent initial training - with emphasis on Cognitive disability education and awareness * Lots of updates/communications or training regarding changes * Most Staff are friendly and welcoming", "cons": "* Lack of diversity within the contact centre in management/coaching roles. * The job is sold to you as a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 customer service role where you have your own empowerment to make decisions and help your customer. However, the role at present is moreso that of a complaints handler or a switchboard operator. You more often than not cannot solve the customers query at source because resources are not there to do so. This means some of the customers, who have been used to a very responsive quick solve to issues, become very quickly frustrated. These issues are prevalent due to changes in the worldwide car market and are out of Motability\u2019s control. However, this means that staff need more support and means to help. Having empowerment can only go so far when you\u2019re telling every customer \u2018its out of our hands\u2019 and \u2018we can\u2019t do anything here to help you with your query at present\u2019. This is affecting many members of staff mental and physical wellbeing. * Call grading can be very confusing for some members of staff. You\u2019re advised to use your empowerment, don\u2019t be scripted, be yourself, use resources around you and keep a solid call structure and you\u2019ll be fine. However, it\u2019s not quite that simple and more often than not if you do everything asked to get a good grading, you\u2019ve then gone above the call time targets. It\u2019s a very precise recipe and a rhythm you have to find yourself but not an easy skill to grasp. The frustrating thing is\u2026. If you get a sub par quality call\u2026 you\u2019re not given direct feedback to work on regarding that, nor are you able to listen back to that call like you can other calls. There is not enough transparency to help those struggling and coaching sessions alone cannot help with this. This is a vast cause of anxiety with new starters. * 'Discretional' nature of management powers /behaviours give for a vast amount of inconsistency between supporting members of staff with welfare concerns. Some managers are incredibly empathetic and go above and beyond. Others, do not. This culture makes it feel difficult at times to approach your own manager if you have an issue. I know I personally did not feel comfortable doing so unless necessary. * Probation is a taboo word. No one will ever truly discuss it with you and its is a vast cause of anxiety for new starters as its such an \u2018face fits\u2019 system. It should not be treated in this nature. Sadly there is a large turn around of staff. Site security have openly commented on this. * Unfair probation system. To pass probation you are advised you must meet Key performance indicator targets (%) for call quality, statistics, absence etc and a \u2018business decision\u2019 is made. However, this is again discretional and if your face fits/your manager likes you you are passed. They advise that the whole picture is taken into consideration. However, this really does not seem to be the case. I know of many with sub par performance who were passed probation and others who were not. I know of those with excellent quality but slightly higher absence who have been failed and other passed. I equally know of someone with a low performance and a higher absence who was passed. To make matters even more inconsistent, there is sometimes just a call with your manager to advise of a pass or sometimes a meeting with a HR rep. Sometimes your review meeting is brought forward and sometimes it\u2019s not. * Male recruitment manager for the role is lovely and personable during recruitment. However, once you have completed training comes across very unfriendly. He has personally ignored me communicating with him on two occasions. I know of other colleagues who\u2019ve faced the same behaviour which is very out of place as the department is that of friendly personable people who all greet one another. * Lack of support to staff with Cognitive Disabilities. As a company they give their employees access to wellness apps, counselling helpline, an initial wellness passport, mental health allies and medical cover including an online digital GP. This is all amazing and can be really helpful for some. So, at its core there is a want to support staff and keep them well. However, from the perspective of an employee there is a lack of understanding from Contact centre management in how to support those within the workplace with conditions. Occupational Health referrals are often completed too late/not at all and there aren\u2019t enough discussions regarding reasonable adjustment that a disabled employee is entitled to. There are of course some managers that are really supportive and lovely, but others that really don\u2019t care less and view helping those with welfare concerns as \u2018hand holding\u2019 or reasons for them to have extra work to do. Sadly, I faced the latter who I felt really did not always listen or communicate well with me. I did not feel comfortable speaking with them or raising any concerns til it was too late and I needed to take some absence. I know of other colleagues who felt the same way and/or had less support than myself both in terms of adjustment or paid sickness. I see this as a huge con as Motability consider themselves a disability inclusive employer, but sadly don\u2019t offer consistent help to their staff. As the job can be very draining at times this is something that sadly I saw affect many members of staff but they didn\u2019t feel able to say at source with their managers out of fear it would come back against them in probation reviews, which sadly, does seems to be the case. * 6 day working week once per month. That week you only get 1 day off which is very draining. There is a half weekday rota\u2019d in to this. However, you still work the weeks full hours to get that half day. This is not enough time to a member of staff to rest."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Steer clear", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 May 2023", "job_title": "Customer Service Representative in Edinburgh, Scotland", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good pay and potentially bonus", "cons": "False promises.

They keep people on who genuinely care about the customer and go beyond just taking a call. If you want to help people and are naturally kind and empathetic you will pass probation. If you fake the empathy to get through the calls you wont make probation as it will show. \r\n\r\n- Amazing training at start, and through out. \r\n- Monthly coaching sessions, EVERY MONTH, to work on what you think you need to improve, this is on YOU to put the effort in and say what you want to improve on. \r\n- If you ask for help you get it\r\n- If you care about helping people you have empowerment to make your own decision and these are not second guessed. \r\n- PAY is great and above any other call center \r\n- LOTS of flexibility to choose your own shift pattern. \r\n- Great BONUS if you work hard you get a better bonus. \r\n- Great benefits, you can flex up annual leave or down\r\n- Great health benefits \r\n- Friendly people and if you are genuine and work hard you are treated as such, if you want to do the bare minimum and get paid high then you wont make it. \r\n- Home & Office working flexibility\r\n\r\nLOTS OF THESE REVIEWS ARE NEGATIVE, these are mainly from the people that cant preform the to standard they have agreed to preform at.

However, don\u2019t be fooled by this. It\u2019s not an easy job and there\u2019s a number of reasons why.", "cons": "Firstly, I\u2019d like to start on training. Training was excellent, 5 weeks of really in-depth training and our trainer, Lee was awesome. Couldn\u2019t fault him. 5 weeks felt like a good amount of time to learn about the job and the tasks we would need to undertake. \r\n\r\nBut then comes probation. I don\u2019t really know where to start. It really felt like you were thrown in the deep end. The most frustrating part is the \u2018coaching\u2019 that was provided. The coaches are designed to support and help you when all it ever made me feel was frustrated, angry and stupid. Be prepared for your coach to ask YOU questions, not the other way around. They will deflect any questions you ask them by asking YOU instead - \u201cwhat do you think? How do you think it went? What could you have done?\u201d My coach made me feel small, inadequate and there were a couple of times I cried because the type of questions asked were so vague I had to keep asking her to narrow the topic down , feeling like an idiot in doing so. Another girl in my team had this happen to her too. Also, there\u2019s not much point in explaining yourself to your coach because they won\u2019t like you standing up for yourself - so basically you\u2019ve got to suck it up. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to be told that \u2018you are responsible for your own training\u2019. I\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt. You could try, but if your face and personality doesn\u2019t fit the Motability mould then you\u2019re gonna have a difficult time getting through. \r\n\r\nThe last few weeks of my probation, I was told I\u2019d be getting a lot of contact time between my coach and manager. That didn\u2019t happen. As days went on, it was obvious they had already made a decision on my probation. Contact became less and less frequent. \r\n\r\nThey will only make you listen to your poor calls, average calls and never your very good or excellent. They won\u2019t even tell you what you did in those calls that made it very good. They will however, happily dissect what you did wrong in a poor call. \r\n\r\nBe prepared to do a lot of work outside of office hours. If you really want to try and pass, your coach and managers will fully expect you to invest your own time to work on your performance. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s stats based. If you\u2019re 0.2% under your target it\u2019s not good enough and they will make you well aware of this. I got told I didn\u2019t pass probation and was then told that my manager would be escorting me out of the building, in front of my team and fellow colleagues. I cannot tell you how humiliating this was, to pack my things, handover my laptop and lanyard for everyone to see.

I could not fault Leon or sach who were amazing upbeat and offered lots of support and encouragement. We went into training with Lee who was also great although we felt this was rushed through no fault of his. After training we attended academy where we were put straight onto phones which as a group we felt we were not ready for. Our group was 10 people. Thereafter we were put into our teams. The team culture is very different where it feels one side of the room is friendly encouraging and helpful, the other side not so much. Very unsupportive and somewhat cult like. It very much felt on the other side if the face fits which is a let down to the good side. Management are varied and again if the office was sliced in half it was mean to say there was a good side and a bad side. I have to say team Dacia and Chris who manages the team is incredible. Very friendly down to earth and welcoming. Unfortunately this is not the case for every team. I also touch upon facilities. You are shown round by someone who appears very friendly however once you are out academy she will not even acknowledge you are there which is disappointing given your initial first impression. Out with the office the canteen staff and coffee takeaway staff are brilliant. If only this was the case in the later side of the office. You are made to feel like you have a false pretence to upkeep within your probation, where numerous people have actively said through conversation they feel anxious coming into the office as they are the new people and passing probation is notoriously hard, which again makes people feel uneasy. After having a good observation in the office and spending time there it feels very much in the Edinburgh office if the face fits within different teams which goes against the company values. I feel management should be looked at, although I for one cannot fault again Chris and Nat who are both exceptional people and actually care. I cannot say the same for the others where I have heard somewhat negative input. I really do hope as a company that Leon can address these issues and hopefully put a means to an end to this where it comes to new starts as this could be a fantastic company to work for if management
