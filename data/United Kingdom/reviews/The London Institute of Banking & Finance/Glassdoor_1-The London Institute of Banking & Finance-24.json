The company boasts \"flexible\" working as a benefit; however, in order to change your contracted work hours by even 30 minutes, one must apply and go through a 6 month trial period concluding with a review (followed by subsequent regular reviews). How is this flexible? \r\n\r\nRegular working from home is also near impossible unless you are management. WFH days for employees are logged on a system and frowned upon by management and HR, despite the proven advantages. You have to beg for a WFH day most of the time. \r\n\r\nVery few opportunities to advance career. High turnover of staff due to unnecessary bureaucracy, low staff morale and unapproachable management. Examples include: \r\n- Management's and HR's concern when you take sick leave isn't your well-being but the legitimacy of your reason. \r\n- Polarised management style - they expect all employees to fit the same mould and do not use individuals' strengths to the company's benefit. \r\n- Some managers really struggle with empathy such as granting compassionate leave (even when signed off by HR). \r\n\r\nLIBF regard themselves as a mental health conscious organisation; however, they are yet to demonstrate this and have no forward-thinking policies in place."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Aug 2019", "job_title": "VLE Administrator in Canterbury, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly organisation that supports all employees in their career growth and personal development.
