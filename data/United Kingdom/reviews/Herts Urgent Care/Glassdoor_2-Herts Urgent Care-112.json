You can\u2019t take time out to read emails but are allowed to stay behind and read them in your own time (unpaid). You have 30 seconds between calls. \r\n\r\nChatting to colleagues is \u201cdiscouraged\u201d. \r\n\r\nToo many of the low level management are miserable, soul destroying and petty. Some are genuinely great people but when you turn up and find the miserables on shift your heart sinks. \r\n\r\nThey are hot on you wearing masks, no jeans, no trainers nor mobiles but these rules don\u2019t seem to apply to management as they wander around the office.\r\n\r\nIf somebody calls 111 by mistake (maybe they wanted test and trace or have a question about the NHS app) you are told to open a case (NHS pays them by the case) and assess them although they have no symptoms, so they can charge the NHS. Keeping them on the phone for 10 minutes only to tell them to go to NHS.UK website. You do have to pass yourself of as NHS although this is a private company that 111 is outsourced to.\r\n\r\nEverything you say is recorded. Auditors listen to however many calls they want and choose which ones to audit. Face don\u2019t fit they choose your bad ones. Face fits they choose your good ones. Though to be honest I was truly awful.\r\n\r\nVery occasionally they provided free food. But don\u2019t let you know so by the time you see it your pizza is cold.\r\n\r\nGuidance is very inconsistent. So you take guidance from one \u201cexpert\u201d and YOU get marked down on audit because another \u201cexpert\u201d disagrees with them.\r\n\r\nThere is a cadre of employees who have been there since they started on 111 and if your happy to cow towel to them you\u2019ll get on great. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019re paid \u00a39.90 an hour whilst on probation which will last at least 6 months (understand a pay rise is imminent so they don\u2019t go below min. wage). \r\n\r\nOnce I was told to take a 20 minute break after a difficult call.
