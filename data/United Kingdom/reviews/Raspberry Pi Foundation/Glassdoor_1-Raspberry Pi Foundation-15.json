He is particularly good at being open and transparent with employees. He communicates frequently with and seeks feedback from staff, so I have always felt involved and aware of what is going on and informed of the decision-making process. He also adopts an open-door policy, which I have appreciated over the years. - RPF is open to new ways of doing things and is ahead of the curve with organisational tools for staff. I have always had the tools I need to do my job well. - An afternoon each week is set aside for the whole organisation to focus on learning and development. Employees have the freedom to choose the courses or type of learning they want to do and are trusted to do it. - Unique programmes that are fun, engaging and respected. - Truly a people-first organisation. My experience has been that the management puts employees before the job. I have had a couple of experiences during my time at RPF when work was overwhelming and/or times were difficult and the Foundation did everything it could to support me. If you flag it, the leadership team will listen. The way the organisation handled covid was outstanding in my opinion. I felt so lucky to work here during that time. - Flexible working policy is great. People are respected and given the freedom to find a working pattern that works for them. - Collaboration is always encouraged and is embedded in the way we work. Our annual residentials (org away days) in particular are a great (and fun) way to connect with other teams away from the day job, and the organisational tools we use are always collaborative. - I have a disability and I have always found the Foundation to be extremely inclusive and considerate. - Medical insurance and a whole host of other benefits. - As I have mentioned above, people are kind at RPF but that's not to say that difficult conversations can't be had. I've had many frank discussions over the years to get the job done. Communication is key. In a nutshell, if you're thinking of joining the foundation I would say do it. It'll be the best decision you'll have made in a long time. I'm moving on, and despite being excited about my next adventure, I'm so sad to leave such a wonderful team and impressive organisation.", "cons": "There aren't many career progression opportunities and the remuneration is okay, but it's what you would expect working for a charity.

The projects I was working on were very complex and it wasn't easy to pull extra resources in.

Pay was less than half of what other companies in the area offer. Yes they're a charity, but a) other comparable charities still offer more, and b) they certainly find the money for a bizarrely large number of mediocre \"leaders\". They'll talk about passion and their mission, but that doesn't put food on the table (especially in Cambridge) and none of their other benefits are anything to shout about. \r\n\r\nThere is no performance-related raise structure - discretionary bonuses are pitiful, and entirely at the whim of the leadership team, meaning anyone who isn't close friends with their boss is going to miss out. There's also no hope of career progression - it's \"Dead Man's Shoes\" for every role, except (funnily enough) in the leadership team, where new roles seem to crop up every 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere's been a huge amount of employee turnover in recent years, and this is purely down to the company's toxic leadership, starting with the CEO. He plays favourites, hires his friends over more qualified candidates for leadership positions, and forces out anyone who dares to call out the mediocre results his methods are achieving. \r\n\r\nThe leadership talks a big game about taking employee feedback seriously, but the only action I saw them take was to bully and patronise anyone who left negative feedback, including trying to find out the names of those who left anonymous feedback (and not to clap them on the back and say \"well done\"). If you aren't smiling and saying how great everything is, don't expect to have many friends in high places. \r\n\r\nWhen allegations of racism were raised, the leadership promised to act but did nothing. When the question of a member of the Royal family being the charity's patron were raised, the leadership's only concern was of their own reputation.\r\n\r\nGood people are leaving in droves or going off sick with stress, and replacing them is getting harder and harder.
