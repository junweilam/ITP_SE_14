End result is either recruit internally or usually go and get expensive contractors if its a resource issue\r\n\r\n- Pay will not be great because you are working in the Charity sector.   You will have to accept this before you join which some people don't.  Even so having too many contractors does not help continuity either \r\n\r\n- Incompetency is rife because of the lazy attitude within the Legion - too often managers cannot be bothered with doing a proper recruiting process and paying for someone with better skills, experience required to do the role.  So end up with promoting people within who are actually found to be inept, useless, inexperienced and clearly not suited and who have no right or credibility to be given the job.

Even worse was allow these people to waste money and nothing done about that when it was clearly detrimental to the Legion.\r\n\r\n- Senior Managers show little interest and do not do enough and act decisively to recognise when something is wrong to take corrective action and therefore everything is always left in a complete mess and create too much uncertainty.\r\n\r\n-Lack of decisions and directions from Senior Management means you either have people in their jobs who are lazy, underachievers or inept or wastrels, spendthrifts - both types do not justify their pay\r\n\r\n-Some departments are weak because there have been too many changes and they are out of touch and not kept pace with what is going around the rest of the organisation this makes cross functional working relationship difficult\r\n\r\n- Work Life balance - if this begins to suffer then my advice would be to leave as not enough is done to help individuals\r\n\r\n- Bullying culture - you might be left to fend for yourself if things get tough as not enough is done to stop this behaviour nor support from line manager.    I did not even get feedback and felt isolated from key discussions to help with the direction of the team.  Worst was felt always get blamed for things went wrong and easily picked on whilst others were clearly being protected nor was my manager willing to show leadership skills which includes empathy, objectivity, being listened to and able to get the team working together because it meant others having to work harder or change their own (selfish) behaviours\r\n\r\n- No real training or career progression programmes in place  \r\n\r\n- High staff turnover -  this is not surprising given the above things seems to always happen"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Byng House - break centres across Legion", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "26 Feb 2019", "job_title": "Manager in Southport, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great organisational ethos which unfortunately doesn\u2019t extend to the staff.", "cons": "Bullying is rife from senior management who manage through fear and threat, creating a controlling environment.
