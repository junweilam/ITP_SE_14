Good step away from all the bad connotations of charity shops full of tat.

I worked 45 plus. HR response will tell you I chose to work those hours. Not true, and they know it. The other Boutique managers, too, work even longer hours and go without days off at times for a week. I refused to work seven days in a go. If you like this job be prepared to do the extra extra hours , you will be \"in\". \r\n\r\nAfter hours merchandising was not a free choice, I was needed on the shop floor during opening hours. The business was just building up so training volunteers was a fundamental part of my day.  Yet I was told to stop working  the extra hours. With hindsight this was to ascertain they had proof they did not break my Contract by getting me work more hours than  contracted. If you are under probation you can still claim for unfair dismissal if your employer breaks  any of the points in your Contract.  \r\n\r\n I am about hard work, but also against exploitation in the workplace so I asked for help from my line manager. She,  instead giving support I had been promised, not written in Contract, but in my interview,  I was told I failed to live up to the terms of my Contract and was therefore terminated there and then. Although the Contract did never stipulate the sum of the weekly target my Appeal was turned down. To say I feel robbed, of my efforts, my rights for fairness, and my professional standing is no exaggeration.\r\n\r\nI was not given fair treatment during my entire work with Shelter. Another person left a feedback about that on 10th July, she is spot on. If you have professional standards this organisation is not for you. \r\n\r\nSo be aware that the Contract you sign is not full set of documentation that will tie you to your post.
