There were no risk assessments done for staff resulting in staff members getting attacked, training was insufficient for what we had to deal with I even mentioned it on more than one occasion even the police were willing to put in a complaint on one occasion. To say I was stitched up is an understatement and I\u2019d advise anyone considering working there to get a good union on your side. Document everything you do and what your management has said to you in meetings and let them know you know your working rights and what the conveniences are for constructive and unfair dismissal is.
