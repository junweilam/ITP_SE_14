The work culture has massively improved, and within the fundraising department the Director has built a very supportive team who are genuinely the most talented fundraisers I have worked with. I don't think there is space for weak links at CP, you do work hard and at times the workload can be challenging but this ebbs and flows throughout the year. The impact of your work can really be seen and the hard work pays off when you see how it really helps young people in need. If you demonstrate yourself then you will be rewarded with a good work/life balance, and I do think Centrepoint are strong in this field. Particularly if there is a lack of progression route, they will try to benefit you in other ways. A lot of work has been undertaken in the last 2 years to improve the culture and benefits, from visible inclusion initiatives to really excellent health benefits such as Medicash/BUPA that tangibly help and are rare in the charity sector. The HR team are supportive and receptive to feedback. The majority of colleagues are very willing to help when you need it, and it generally feels like a supportive workplace. All in all, it feels like a safe and supportive workplace that also accepts that you have a life outside of work - HR and my line manager have been very supportive around a challenging change in my health over the last year and ensuring I have the adaptations I require to be able to carry on succeeding in my role. While there have been a couple of blips in the last years, these have always been effectively handled by senior members in the team and/or HR when required. Centrepoint is a pragmatic workplace, no organisation is perfect but they really are trying to improve things as best as they can and I really can see the effects of this compared to when I started. I think it's a great charity to be part of.", "cons": "- Departments can feel silo'ed at times - Progression routes are not always there - Some senior management changes needed - a mixed bag"},
