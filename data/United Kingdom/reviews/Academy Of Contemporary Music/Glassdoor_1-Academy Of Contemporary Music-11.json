The team I worked with all turned blind eyes to what I was experiencing - not one of them had a decency to atleast ask if I was ok. The only one who reached out was a lady (ex employee) who had seen me being spoken to in a manner that was not acceptable. Her advise to me was ACM was a lost cause and not worth my mental health and bullying that I was suffering. I regret not taking her advise sooner but I had my reason (obviously that being acm my only source of income). I approached HR and requested external counsellor who I could speak to about my experience and get unbiased advice. I was given no support but instead referred to in-house counsellor. I was in desperation so I contacted the in-house counsellor only to be told her service is limited to students only. I dont hold anything against the in-house counsellor but shouldnt HR know better? What was required of me to be taken seriously? I have always been a diligent worker with good work ethics. And what I experienced at ACM wasnt my normal. I have always been well respected personnel of companies i had worked for so it was important for me to get a clarification on why I was being made to feel the way I did ... the person I was picked on by said it wasn't my work that she had issue with. Which basically means she hated me for me being me. My ethnicity perhaps? For these reasons, I would not recommend ACM to young professionals from different ethnicity who hasn't yet build a tough skin. Also to the lady I met on the supermarket - No it wasn't the work at ACM that I found overwhelming, I reached a decision to leave because your chummy did not treat me well.

No one feels safe in their job and if you spend at least 5 minutes talking to any member of staff, they will tell you their own horror stories, and some of them are truly shocking. \r\n- Pay is inconsistent and you will spend the days before payday trying to figure out if you have enough money for the month despite working hard and long hours. \r\n- HR department seems to be non-existent, but if they do exist, they are not there to support employees. Feels like the chairman is standing behind them in any meeting or discussion. \r\n- The chairman is very disappointing and runs the place like he's never met another human being before. The place is run like a business rather than educational institute, however the chairman seems to have no idea how to run a business. \r\n- People seem to fall uphill here all the time - people walk into high paying roles with no experience in the role, and this impacts everyone negatively as no one at the executive level seems to know what they are doing. \r\n- No communication at all between managers and their staff, huge changes happen seemingly on a whim and no one knows until the last minute.\r\n- God forbid you cross the chairman and his ego - if he feels you have stepped out of line, your professional life will be made hell until you leave. Tutors don't get fired, but they will be pushed to the ends of their limits until they lose spirit and leave of their own accord.\r\n- Turnover of staff is astounding, at least 10 people have left within the past 1 month period alone. \r\n- Big promises are made to students and staff and they are not delivered, I feel dreadful for the students who are promised the world during open days, but as soon as they agree to come to study here, they become a bag of money to rinse as much as possible. \r\n- Staff regularly made to do work outside of their role and contract (if they have one) which they are not trained for, and if they get anything wrong here they will be belittled and bullied. \r\n- Higher Education benchmarks and REF don't seem to be very important or focused on, in my experience I haven't had more than one conversation with a fellow employee about these topics. There is no appreciation for excellence in teaching, the best teachers and tutors leave as they are not empowered at all in their skills. \r\n- Zero-hour contracts are not only commonplace, but seem to be the majority. This may seem better than nothing if you are desperate for a job, but these hours can be stripped from you at an instance if you rub anyone up the wrong way. Don't walk, run from these kinds of contracts. \r\nOverall the place is run like a pyramid scheme, and if you care about students and teaching, this place will ruin that care and passion. The chairman is quite frankly unhinged and incapable of running such a large scale operation. It is a shame that he feels the need to be so unkind and lacks basic empathy, and I hope one day he will reflect on why he is this way for his own sake. \r\nI personally thought all these reviews were over-dramatic when I joined, but I was proved wrong within months. It is truly a miracle to me that this place is still running, there are a great deal of unethical practises and the culture is thick with anxiety amongst all staff. \r\nLastly, if you are still not sure if you should take these reviews seriously - there are a number of positive ones, but look closely at the dates of them. All the clusters of positive reviews here have been done on the same day, and this is likely not a coincidence - if I were the chairman I too would worry about the low scores and perhaps 'encourage' staff to post glowing reviews, regardless of the lies within them."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Mentor in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have been with ACM for 3 years now.
