Steer clear at all cost! They do not have a clients best interest at heart. its all about fitting in as many clients as possible in as little time as possible. It's all about the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 to them.   \r\nThe same message goes to the carers; this company will chew you up, spit you out and have you replaced before you have left the door. They are constantly short staffed and having to hire new staff because nobody can stand the company for any length of time once they discover the truth for themselves. \r\n\r\nIt's sad to say but every single one of my clients held a grudge with the company (Allied) due to the way that it was run and would voice there concerns to me on a regular basis.

The supervisor just laughed it off and said that it's fine to go in there.   \r\n\r\nThey rarely give travel time between each job and if they did on occasion it was never enough.  \r\nPetrol paid for is minimum at 24p per mile. Most places pay 45p per mile. \r\nThey are legally required to pay travel time, which I never once received despite my many messages to management.  \r\n\r\nMy wages were short on a regular basis, which meant I was having to spend my own private time sorting through pages of paperwork to pin point the exact calls I had not been paid for only to contact them each time and have them tell me that I was wrong. After a drawn out debate and system research they would finally agree that I was owed money but would make it seem like I was making a fuss about nothing saying \"Oh yes, I see you were not paid for 3 calls but its only \u00a3 (whatever amount it was).
