Poor management, lack of direction, inconsistent demands and I would say a lack of interest in staff wellbeing and flexible working arrangements are all issues here. \r\nBroader, I do think there is an issue with hierarchy at the trust. Leadership teams/executives are not visible and many of them do not seem to make an interest to be so. In some ways it is a very old fashioned place to work, with senior people being able to behave in ways or get away with things junior staff would not. This is not across the board and the CEO has made efforts to be more visible and accessible during covid-19, but there are a few individuals who have been at the trust for a long time who seem a bit untouchable. The trust has been through a lot being at the heart of covid-19, the medical services and teams seem second to none and very proud to be part of the trust, but different standards seem to apply in some - not all- non medical divisions."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Amazing work environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "16 Mar 2021", "job_title": "RN Staff Nurse in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "lovely colleagues to work with", "cons": "Very old building however with modern technology"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Feb 2021", "job_title": "Charge Nurse in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Centre of excellence & great teamwork", "cons": "no significant problems different to any other major London teaching hospital"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Very good to work in this hospital.", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Feb 2021", "job_title": "HCA/Phlebotomist in Harefield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Helping covid patients & taking blood.", "cons": "Very challenging, satisfaction, confidence & happy to work."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bullies", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "None.
