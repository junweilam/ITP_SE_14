cost of living not great, many people have to work overtime hours to boost pay.", "cons": "Physically and mentally draining, increasingly complex service users / high medical care and challenging behavior. \r\nNo breaks, even on 12 hour shifts. Breaks are paid so due to the busy environment you are expected to continue working throughout. \r\nRarely see the senior management team mix unless inspections are taking place.\r\nLow pay for very high responsibility and stress. \r\nSome individuals in other departments look down upon care staff, lack of respect is evident.\r\nRefresher training not planned and given when it should be. \r\nCurrently a very high rate of care staff turnover resulting in continuous and constant recruitment drives, lowered standards and a high use of unfamiliar external agency staff many of who's level of care commitment is questionable. \r\nRequired equipment to carry out job role is not always readily accessable such as laptops / computers, recording stations. \r\nNo staff rooms in residences / no time away from the work floor. \r\nRecent years appear to be employing many people who are unqualified, unskilled and generally lack any sense of a caring nature. \r\nIf your face fits and you do exactly as you are told you will be left alone and may be able to progress into senior management roles, if you question anything or speak up you will eventually be constructivley dismissed or out the door.\r\nTerrible sickness policy, front line care staff sit within the same policy as office based staff. \r\nEarly / Late shifts. Finishing at 11pm and back in at 7am. Little sleep / fatigue, no social life, long hours on alternate weekends. \r\nSenior management team are rarely seen  mixing \"on the floor\" or checking in on service users or co-workers, until there is an inspection or visitors then they are tripping over eachother to support!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Best place I've ever worked", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Aug 2017", "job_title": "Support in Cheltenham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It's a great place to be, with very good training and lots of opportunity to get involved with new things.
