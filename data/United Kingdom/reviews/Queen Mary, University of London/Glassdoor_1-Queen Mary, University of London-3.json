The job is unbelievably lonely, ignoring the directors all doing their own thing, the staff age gap was averaging around 40+ years to a recent masters grad.

The staff events numbered in around 3 for the whole year I was with them, to which all the staff promptly went home after 9. If you don't fit in the clique (very easy to do that), it becomes even more isolating. Essentially - if you are finding yourself, trying to meet people or just generally an extrovert, do not bother working there. You'll find yourself to be depressed very quickly. I admit the staff were all nice to a degree, but they do not care about you outside of what they have to do, and will readily leave you in your box office for an eternity, or until you just stop working and then they complain about you."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great Company to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jul 2023", "job_title": "Reward Analyst in Whitechapel, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Friendly work atmosphere.

This results in them having 5-7 PhD students, while early career researchers (ECRs) or junior faculty find themselves with 0-1 students, with no support when they need it the most, at the very start of their careers. This limits the ECR's career advancement prospects and hurts their grant applications, which results in a snowball effect, that amounts to career suicide. Many ECRs departed the Schools of Mathematics and Physics after last year's fiasco, highlighting the lack of support by the School. Do you think that changed anything?
