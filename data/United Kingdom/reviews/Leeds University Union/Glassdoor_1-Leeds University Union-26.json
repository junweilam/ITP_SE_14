Beyond the sabbatical officer team there was a wider culture issue regarding psychological safety, with many colleagues roles being axed unfairly or colleagues feeling scared to provide genuine contributions if they didn\u2019t align with the senior leadership\u2019s own views. In LUU there is a schmoozing game to be played in order to succeed and those not willing to go against their own values to accommodate this will suffer as a result.

The pay is incredibly poor, the place runs on underpaid graduates who work way above their pay grade for a couple of years before leaving and realising they\u2019re worth more, at which point LUU hires a carbon copy graduate and the cycle repeats. \r\nThere is a huge divide between commercial and non commercial departments. Commercial departments slog to make money to keep the union literally with a hot water supply, while non-commercial departments spend the money on unnecessary events and pointless campaigns. This is done all in the name of creating a better space and experience for students, without realising that without the commercial teams there would be no money to keep the building and staff, never mind put on campaigns in the name of inclusivity.
