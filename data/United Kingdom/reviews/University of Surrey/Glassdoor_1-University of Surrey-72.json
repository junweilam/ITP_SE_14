And the staff at university is really trying to do their individual bests to achieve excellence and a lot of funding and effort is spent on this.", "cons": "On the higher levels the policies taken are horrendous sometimes. For example they had this Bonus Scheme where if the university made a profit at the end of year they distributed \u00a370 to each member staff as a yearend of bonus.  I would rather they gave this money to supporting staff (e.g. cleaners or other low paid staff) than to academics which was more like a slap on the face amount to be paid to skilled workers. I think most thought the same as later on they scrapped it and made it a performance related pay scheme, which was equally bad: at the end of the year those who have exceeded expectations in their appraisals received pre-tax 250\u00a3 bonus which again came to nothing. Giving such amounts to academics who excel is just laughable. It is more demotivating than motivating.  Academics have high intrinsic motivations and when they want to be recognised for their efforts they want to get comparative salaries to those that are paid in other fields in private sector and not some crumbles.\r\nAnother thing I experienced as an international staff member was their miniscule and often selective contributions towards visa costs. While most other universities reimburse visa costs in full (visa+NHS surcharge) and sometimes that of dependents, Surrey only pays for visa cost of the main applicant. Yet we know of many cases where some senior staff members have received reimbursements both for their visas&NHS surcharge + for their dependents... So the policy seems to be quite selective and discriminating. While I can understand university\u2019s aversion to reimburse the full cost of visa and add-ons, the recent policy taken by the university in claiming tax from reimbursements is beyond my comprehension. The university decided to classify visa fee reimbursement as a \u201ctaxable benefit\u201d which meant that only 2/3 of the visa cost is now being reimbursed. \r\n\r\nOh and finally.
