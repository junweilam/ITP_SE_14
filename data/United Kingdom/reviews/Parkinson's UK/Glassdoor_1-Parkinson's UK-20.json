Then again, it could be a chicken/egg situation. Ie have the new leadership and senior level changes spurred this unpleasant culture? Many colleagues think so, as the atmosphere at Parkinson's UK massively soured after the old CEO left and new leadership took the reins. A running joke at Parkinson's UK is how there's a ridiculous excess of line managers because people hire their favourites to management positions. I'm not saying this applies to everyone, but there are a lot of managers with a worrying lack of management experience and in some cases, employment and life experience. This has opened up a culture of bad leadership which lower level employees are lumbered with and have to bear the brunt of. In a lot of teams there's one person managing another person. This makes no sense especially in very small teams. Either the CEO and big cheeses haven't noticed this, or they just turn a blind eye and don't think it's important enough to challenge. Because there's such a culture of nepotism, there's very little opportunity for people to develop in their roles and be given fair opportunity for promotion (unless as I said, you are a favourite). This is why so many people end up leaving. They don't want to stick around in an environment where they don't feel valued or appreciated. It's been sad to see many talented colleagues who had so much potential leave because of this reason. There have also been many redundancies at the charity in the last month. This has made the atmosphere very unpleasant and shown a very horrible side of colleagues who were/are worried about losing their jobs. If you come to work to work, and not get swept up in petty politics and power trips, this might not be the place for you. Many longtime colleagues reminisce about the glory days with the old CEO Steve and how they wish he had stayed. He was a much admired and human CEO who made an effort to know his staff by name and treat everyone respectfully, no matter what level they worked at. This created a really lovely working environment and high levels of morale among staff. It's very sad to see this old atmosphere change completely and turn the opposite way."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Used to be great, now toxic and corporate", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "6 May 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Some great colleagues who are passionate and driven about the cause, good location and flexi-hours policy.", "cons": "As another reviewer has expressed, Parkinson's UK was a great place to work until the new CEO joined and made copious changes - for the worst- alongside dismantling a once positive working culture and turning it into a thoroughly unpleasant and corporate-like environment.

This has resulted in some highly ruthless and unfair behaviour.

In the past few weeks, two notable members of staff were made redundant, and this has naturally instilled a widespread feeling of fear and unease among many remaining staff. I have no doubt that this recent chop was merely the tip of the iceberg and that many more redundancies will likely follow in the coming year. \r\n\r\nAt the helm of the charity is a neurotic CEO who has a habit of chopping and changing things without giving her decisions due thought. She hasn\u2019t done a great deal to ingratiate herself with staff members either. Many have been at the receiving end of her frosty and arguably haughty demeanour. She\u2019ll only acknowledge you if occupy a higher level within the charity, otherwise she\u2019ll just stare right through you, like you don\u2019t exist. This has created a frosty and unpleasant atmosphere, which has personally put me off coming into the office, and opting to work from home instead. She also has a giant wallchart of the entire organisational structure in her office. No doubt she spends a great deal of time surveying this chart and deciding who\u2019ll be next to get the chop. \r\n\r\nTalking of working from home, the CEO also enforced a strict \u201ctwo day a week\u201d working policy in April, which opened the floodgates to many staff exiting the charity. While I personally had no reservations about the new policy, it seems odd to me that it\u2019s completely fallen by the wayside as hardly anyone (including management) currently abide by it. It just makes you wonder/lament how many staff needlessly left the charity in recent months.

This was down to the presumption that we were too busy with our BAU work - the operative word being \"presumption\".

However, ultimately I have confidence that the decisions being made come from an excellent senior leadership team and board of trustees.\r\n\r\nI also believe internal comms hasn't quite hit the nail on the head yet. There are far too many different channels of communication which can impact on the effectiveness of cross directorial communications. Additionally, there is a lot or irrelevant comms, as such staying up to date with all that is happening in such a wide-reaching organisation can be challenging.\r\n\r\nI can understand previous comments about changes to working environment and frustrations pay, but I believe they are not unique to Parkinson's UK. \r\n\r\nThere does seem to be a high level of turnover, which is frustrating. Recruiting, in any organisation, is a pain, and there can be a loss of continuity and momentum as new recruits to get up to speed, but I believe this shows how much opportunity there is to take on new challenges and learn new skills.
