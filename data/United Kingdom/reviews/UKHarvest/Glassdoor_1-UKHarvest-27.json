There's a brand new office, which is still all coming together but is already one of the nicest places I've ever worked. \r\n\r\nThe team and culture that we have is absolutely perfect, and the whole management team put a lot of effort into keeping it that way.\r\n\r\nThere are SO many opportunities! Organising the volunteers is one of the most exciting jobs as no matter whose walked in the door, it isn't hard to find them their perfect placement, and start to build a great relationship with them.", "cons": "Almost a victim of their own success, UKHarvest is growing so fast! It's being managed very well, however, and I am not concerned that they will be able to take on the challenge."}], []]
