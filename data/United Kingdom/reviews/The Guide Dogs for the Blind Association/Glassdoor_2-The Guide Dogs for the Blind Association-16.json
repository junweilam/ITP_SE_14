But this isn\u2019t really a pro its not an achievement of the organisation, you could go and stand in a field with them and its the same result. Its a failing really that the staff have to be so supportive of each other as its lacking from leadership. If only the EB and management had the same humanity as these people.", "cons": "After almost six years at guide dogs and now having been in a new role for a new employer I have had time to reflect on my time at Guide Dogs and want to offer an honest and constructive review of the continued failings of this organization. - This is by any standards a toxic workplace, it has been for years and years. Bullying is pretty standard at mid and senior management - my view is that it is driven from both known incompetence of individuals covering their own lack of experience. Worse it is driven by the belief that bullying is an acceptable form of behavior for staff. It is driven from top down but is visable throughout the organisation. - I have a thirty year employment history, never have i had direct reports in tears as I had at Guide Dogs - never have I had my concerns dismissed by my managers and senior leaders. -As above the mental health of staff is sadly deplorable. I had two team members experience a crises in my time at Guide Dogs, this I have never experienced in 30 years of managing staff. The support I received to deal with this was non existent and it was brushed under the carpet. I had evidence and was a witness to the verbal abuse experienced by staff from senior management that resulted in this crises. No action was taken outside of talk of resilience training for staff!. - I was witness to outrageous accusations of staff by senior management. Verbal and email abuse was common and vulnerable team members were singled out - red font type and upper caps in an an abusive email is childish and deplorable. Face to face meetings and conversations an acceptable means of communicating were not a reality in this organization sadly. - its a big organization but communication is awful. There are many big organizations who do not have these problems. The fact being that plans and strategies are not brought into, they are dropped on staff by senior leaders who then wash their hands of it. Because the plans are not fully supported it causes division in teams those trying to work hard conflict with those resisting change- creating more work, stress, frustration and disillusion. Of course HR and senior leaders do nothing, more bullying happens and things don\u2019t change. - Nepotism is rife, I can\u2019t count how many times incompetent staff were promoted by long term friends into senior positions. The amount of long service awards means there is an entrenched group of staff who have been employed for 20, 30+ years. This group resist change and promote from within the clique. - A common experience was huge directorate meetings where often the director would hold court over the entire directorate and single out individuals in such a humiliating way it was awful. I was shocked to see this behavior but also the style of meeting was so old fashioned and dated - completely unproductive in a modern organization. It seemed to be an exercise in bullying and fear. - Literally how long are you going to use \u2018The Pandemic\u2019 as an excuse for every failing at this organization?? Come on the whole world went through the pandemic- that means every single company and organization did too, why do you think you can keep using this as an excuse? What you do is review the impact of the pandemic and then take the relevant changes and adapt to conditions, not blunder on regardless and then when it fails say \u2018oh it was the pandemic\u2019 - are you going to keep saying this until 2033? - Honestly if you are a reasonable human being with good social skills and a experience of typical organisational processes- basically an everyday person good at their job - avoid working at this organisation, it will ruin your mental health. There are many other places to work that will not crush your soul. - Overall nice people attracted to working for a charity will be ruined by the other type of person employed, a incompetent, narcissistic bully who seems to be attracted to this organization as its one of the only places where they can get away (be rewarded even) by their toxic behaviors. (could be the norm in other charities I don\u2019t know). If this is was a school it would be put under special measures - avoid."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Rewarding job", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Mar 2023", "job_title": "GDMI in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Rewarding role that makes a difference", "cons": "Senior management make questionable decisions to detriment of clients"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "People are the culture", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "15 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Programmer Manager in Oxford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I love the team I work in and have an amazing line manager.
