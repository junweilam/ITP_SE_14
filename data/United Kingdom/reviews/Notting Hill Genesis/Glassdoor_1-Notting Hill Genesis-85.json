As an 'employee' I too have been through lots of changes of circumstances including; maternity, juggled the childcare of a young family and have also worked in 3 different job roles so I have experienced life as a 'Genesis employee' from a variety of perspectives.\r\n\r\nThe 3 main pros of working at Genesis are as below:\r\n\r\n1) Career progression and opportunities:   For those who work hard, get involved in extra projects/forums and go the 'extra mile' within their roles there are lots of opportunities for career progression both sideways into a different team or upwards into a more senior role.   This has been the main reason I have stayed here for so long rather than looking externally for new opportunities.  I feel like I have really invested in Genesis and its residents in the long-term. Its such a big organization with a wide variety of teams so there really are lots of opportunities to keep learning for those who genuinely want to learn. \r\n\r\n2) Agile working practices, working from different locations flexibly, hot desking- This might not be for everyone, but I personally love the freedom of being able to move around depending on the needs of the job. Some days I'm in head office or if out of office and in-between meetings I can work in a coffee shop or library.  There is a big focus at Genesis (at least within my team) on outputs rather than being visibly stuck to the same desk 9-5pm which isn't necessarily efficient. I also find this helps my general wellbeing and maintaining a good work- life balance. \r\n\r\n3) Great staff: Staff at Genesis on the whole are friendly and helpful. My team colleagues are amazing and so is my manager which makes it easy to get on with the job at hand rather than using energy dealing with internal politics. \r\nOf course, as with any large organization there are some areas of the business where I think job satisfaction is low and this affects how they interact with other internal staff but on the whole the majority of people are helpful and really nice at Genesis.", "cons": "1) Few accredited training opportunities- This may very well soon change with the introduction of the apprenticeship levy but currently there is nothing in terms of accredited training opportunities internally or externally. \r\n\r\n2) Lots of restructures, mergers and changes causes staff to feel anxious- The restructures itself aren't the problem as I like change I think it keeps things fresh, however for many staff  the constant change is disruptive and causes people to feel anxious.  As a result the run up to the restructure/change date  can be quite a difficult period of time to work in."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Poor employer and bad stock", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "21 Jul 2019", "job_title": "Plumber in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It\u2019s a job  if you can stand working with poor management", "cons": "In my opinion and in the minority\u2019s opinion it is a racist company that does not like white people. \r\n All the pictures that you see online are fake as I never saw a clean and nice property all of the properties I was working on what I would run down smothered in damp and mould but we was still told to spend less."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Love it here despite a few niggles", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "15 Jun 2016", "job_title": " in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent employer, flexible working, great place for women, lgbt people to work and hot on diversity and inclusion.
