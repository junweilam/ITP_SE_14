The TSC is given money by Innovate UK and it wastes it. I've seen it first hand, if you want to take your foot off your career and catch a breath before you get back into meaningful work, try and land a gig at the TSC. You will go in with all the energy of the world, huffing and puffing, then after a period nothing happens. You become disillusioned, you contemplate your options, then think, this is easy money, like a high paid footballer sitting on the bench. It's a passive income.
