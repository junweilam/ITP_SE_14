We were still sharing a small space in our trustee's office in Moorgate, London. I don't think I could have imagined how much we grew as a team in such a short space of time.\r\nSince I joined we've moved office a couple of times, finally making Bermondsey our home. Our team now includes a Research department, as well as offices in Berlin and New York.\r\nLike most young organizations, we've become a family. It's corny, but we're a group of friends who happen to work together. Work can be tough, busy, stressful, but it's never dull.\r\nI'm often asked what my favorite thing about FP is: We have a shared intellectual curiosity. Everyone here is curious about the world, how it works. We don't all think the same way, but we have a mutual respect for one another's views and are open to discuss these in detail.\r\nAnother perk is the perks: there weren't many options when I started, as is typical of young teams. But as we've grown we've brought in new benefits for the team as people have described a need; better holiday plans, a clearer sickness policy, LOTS of free food in the office!\r\nThe management style is also far more collaborative than other organizations I've worked at. There's always an open dialogue with team leaders and the Exec Team, and plans are put in place together so that everyone knows what they're working on and what is achievable.\r\nFP is a challenge, but it's one we like to get stuck into to!", "cons": "Being a young org, there are things FP can always improve on, such as a focus on individual's progression as it relates to their personal goals and ambitions.
