Much change underway to significantly grow the presence and effectiveness of ECRI outside of the USA as well as in. An exciting time with great plans for both a sustainable and ever improving business that should be an attractive option for talented individuals who also seek a greater purpose in their work.", "cons": "At this time, some people may fear the risk of change, without having yet feared the risk and consequences of not changing.  Change is being driven through a thorough, evidence based process, balancing not for profit obligations and advantages with the commercial realities of building ECRI to serve more members globally, so not much of a con really and is an opportunity to grasp, if so minded."}]]
