Over recent years, things haven't always run smoothly and I understand that that's not fun for some of the staff involved.  But some staff seemed to complain about literally everything, making it their business to bring down the morale of everyone round them.  Looking at some of the previous reviews, there are things being said that are highly personal, grossly unfair, and in some cases, laughably wrong and inaccurate.  I think one says \"they only turn on the heating for an hour a day\", and \"only 10 people have  been here longer than a year\" - both of these are so far from the truth it shows the lengths some were prepared to go to to find things to  complain about.  I only reference it here as I think the reviews these former staff have left on this site skew the perception of what it's like to work at Bloodwise, and it's important to provide an accurate picture rather than the hugely unfair negative ones previously left.

In just about six months I saw at least 30 of my colleagues quitting (some of them feeling quite depressed and anxious), whilst the senior management did nothing to sort it out.
