Overworked. Always short staffed due to the workload, pay and how staff get treated. Managements attitude to staff was absolutely disgusting. Any concerns reported never get sorted putting service users health, wellbeing and life at risk. Anything goes wrong that wasn't your fault even when on shifts you wasn't in for your blamed for. Shockingly run. The house needed so many repairs yet were never fixed. They didn't wanna know if it cost money.\r\n\r\nLoved the service users and did my best as some others (not all) did. Unfortunately team leaders and management never listen to the staff that work hands on with service users. When you try to put forward things that will work as dome things aren't working causing behaviours. In end Ian a couple of others implemented changes in how we dealt with things on my shift with each service user as it worked and made the service user happier and safer even helped them learn to communicate abit better. So we started to have less and less problems/behaviours when we was on shift but during days when management etc was in their was behaviour after behaviour. Even after all that the management (who didn't work with the service users) still refused to make changes and just made everything more difficult and unsafe for staff and service users.\r\n\r\nSo badly run and it's a shame that staff can leave but the service users are stuck their.\r\n\r\nIf their was better management. If staff were listened to more. Even if management listened more to team leaders too. If they managed the house more and if staff were given better pay instead of minimum wage (get paid more at McDonalds) then you would retain more staff and have a happier environment for the service users and the staff.\r\n\r\nI was offered a team leader role and laughed in their face. The pay was disgusting for how much you do. They either needed new management for me to take the job or id happily become manager and turn the place around.\r\n\r\nA big thing to was you pulling the slack for other people not doing their job or the ones that actually preferred to sit around and go sleep.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on about incidents that happened and staff and service users ignored by higher ups.\r\n\r\nNo realistic career progression either."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Ok but pay not the best", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "22 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Support Worker in Doncaster, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Rewarding, feeling of making a difference", "cons": "Pay is poor\r\nI left to go to a supermarket that paid more"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "A Small business", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "21 Apr 2022", "job_title": "IT Technician in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Exposure to some new IT equipment", "cons": "My Team was too small"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great charity to work for", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Doncaster, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I have really enjoyed my time with Autism Plus so far.
