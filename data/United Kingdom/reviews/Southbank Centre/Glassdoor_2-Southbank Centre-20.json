Staff are always worried about approaching management about concerns that they have and HR are 'friends' with the management team of my department and are therefore often unhelpful when resolving requests. Working environments are sometimes pretty bad (no air conditioning in certain places in the summer, making it impossible to work without regular breaks which we often don't receive) You are not praised for going above and beyond in your role or if you take on additional hours when someone calls in sick or temporary members of staff don't turn up for shifts. Calling in sick is difficult and there have been times where I have called for hours without any response. This would be a lovely place to work but team members are always worried about doing something 'wrong' and don't get the support they need and therefore it makes for a horrible environment to work in.
