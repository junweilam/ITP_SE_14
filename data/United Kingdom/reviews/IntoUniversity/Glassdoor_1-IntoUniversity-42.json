Some HR reps have very cavalier attitudes and believe that rules and laws don't apply to them. Unfortunately this is no surprise as they have been able to get away with very questionable practices with little or no consequences and/or oversight from their direct superiors. Furthermore, some HR reps seem far more interested in supporting managerial staff than those in what some may regard as 'normal' roles. This has led to mistrust among some staff members who believe they will not be treated fairly and justly. There is a general fear that if a staff member complains about mistreatment from their superiors that they will be 'black listed' and this may affect job security. This has inevitably led to the declining morale and mental wellbeing of staff and a very poor work culture. There is also very little support for disabled staff as no expert training is offered to raise disability awareness among managerial staff. \r\n\r\nThat said, all hope is not lost as I believe this could be overcome with more support and oversight from the senior leadership team and the hiring of individuals with high moral character to lead on a much needed cultural shift and overhaul.

As an able bodied person it was challenging, let alone if you have any disabilities which contradicted their D&I ethos. Senior management should allow more than one wfh day a month for the sake of retaining their staff. We were told off for having one day off a month but senior management because it was in our probation period (6 months), which they backtracked on as they didn't know their own policies. I commuted over an hour to work mostly so my working day door to door could be 7.45am - 7.15pm. During the training period senior management did not seem to take into account where people are living and did not explain the thought process behind sending you to a centre an hour away from where you live, despite there being 4 much closer.

There was not enough time to brief properly for programmes which were often delivered at a poor standard. The second focus programmes are outdated and not useful for the students. No real chance for progression - the senior education worker position seems like a strategy retain staff but based on nothing. There are no real extra responsibilities and there is no progression up from there (other than centre leader which seems like a very stressful and underpaid job).

Given the point of the charity, how could this have been in place for such a long time? -HR can be brutal. No leeway given with strict notice periods - depending when you hand your notice in this can be around 3-4 months. This will definitely put off your future employers if you are at the start of your career, despite what HR will tell you. Please keep this in mind before you apply -Charity feels in a transition period between smaller and larger organisation, and is holding on to its old practices despite them not working with its current larger scale. For example frequent cluster and whole team meetings are mostly waste of time and serve to stress out regional staff having to travel to London around train strikes -Cult vibes. Singing songs and doing little drama skits for when the favourites leave the charity. Leaves a bitter taste when you give up so much of your time for the young people -As a Centre Leader I felt like I did not have enough time to reflect, conceive and implement CPD for my team. There is always a hundred fires to be put out and plates to keep spinning - some new idea by Head Office which needs to be implemented, a spreadsheet to be filled in, or logistical issues of the centre -Funder and corporate visits to the centre are organised last-minute with minimal support from Head Office. Attitude of 'deal with it'. -Centres are often dingy and depressing. It takes a toll on mental health in dark winter months finishing at 6pm -Logistics of onboarding and training new Education Workers doesn't make sense. If you start outside of the January/August cohorts, you will receive a very rushed initial training by Centre Leader, then learn everything as you work. However you will still have to attend the full 6 weeks of in-person training with the next cohort in London. It will be redundant and largely a waste of time. Taking away Education Workers in these instances only adds pressure to centre teams -6 weeks of training feels like it could be done in 3.

There is a sickeningly toxic 'can do' positive attitude that can be found throughout the charity and is forced whenever it's a hard or busy time, which is often. They never actually address or seem to want to solve the cause of the issue though. \r\n\r\n- there are so many issues with how the charity handles issues around D&I. Quite fankly, if you have a disability or from a minority ethnic background then the job will be 10x harder than it already is. From covert to casual culturally offensive comments from new to senior staff and sometimes disguised as 'feedback', and constantly moving tables, going on campus tours and commuting to and from schools, this job isn't for anyone who ticks these boxes. \r\n\r\n- There is a concerningly lack of diversity within the senior management/leadership team which is poor considering the diverse background of students. \r\n\r\n- the charity will say they're doing things to improve D&I but everyone is too overworked to actually acknowledge this behaviour and commit to improving this. Ironically those who need D&I training most are those in Centre Leader roles or above. \r\n\r\n- your experience will very much depend on the centre/cluster youre based in, which is down to luck. There are a few staff members who are known to be hard to work with but you can't complain due to their seniority (no matter how much they say you can, you can't). \r\n\r\n- there is a very high staff turnover and a lot of people leave after 1 year, sometimes even sooner. This means most centres are understaffed or have staff that are still learning the role but are still expected to hit target. This then means most centres are overworked. \r\n\r\n- TOIL isn't recorded accurately enough. The salary might look good on paper but when you break it down, you do a lot more than your contracted hours. The charity makes up for this with 'discretionary days' but its still not enough in my opinion. \r\n\r\n- you have to attend whole team meetings in London 3 times a year but they're mostly a waste of time because everyone is either tired from travelling, in their own friendship group or your friends have already left the charity. You dont really get the chance to meet new people so you have to like your cluster to able to enjoy these meetings. \r\n\r\n- you usually eat lunch with your team which just feels like more work. Also since most centres aren't that diverse, it can be really uncomfortable sitting there but then if you do other stuff, you feel left out of the centres social circle (which is already really small). \r\n\r\n- the only reason why I put 2 stars for career opportunities is for everything you can do once you leave. If you stay in the charity, the promotion you could realistically successfully apply for is Centre Leader. \r\n\r\n- you can raise these issues with whoever you want, however many times you like, communicate this in so many different ways, have as many meetings as your free time allows yet it's very unlikely anything will change (unless you're friends with someone). The issues I have written about have been raised by myself and other before me but nothing was changed no matter how much they say they are 'addressing the issue'.
