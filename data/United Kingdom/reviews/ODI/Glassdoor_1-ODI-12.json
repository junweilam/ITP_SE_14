I have seen white staff being promoted over non-white staff in some circumstances and yet those who knew the non-white staff would say that individual was a more stronger candidate than the white member of staff. ODI has huge turn-overs. Each month at-least 4 staff leave and arrive considering ODI staff is only 200 head count, or there about. A lot of people even question the work ODI does and does it really have any benefits? Researches spend far more time at their desks in London than do they do in the field, yet they describe themselves as experts.\r\nFunds are wasted. I have been told by some research staff that a lot of the trips they do abroad is unnecessary and they could have done so other more economical means. The carbon footprint is huge due to the number of unnecessary overseas trips staff, yet they have a huge Climate team. Some staff try and use and abuse the lack of a expenses policy at ODI, which is shocking, both the fact that ODI does not have a clear expenses policy and that staff try and abuse this. It has been known that staff have blatantly tried to claim travel expenses of items they know is questionable. One example was a staff member claimed for having a head massage due to their flight being cancelled and as a result they had a migraine and need the massage to help them!!"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Stimulating workplace", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Oct 2018", "job_title": "Communications Specialist in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Passionate people work here because they care about tackling poverty and making a positive difference in international development and humanitarian affairs.
