As a high performer I could not fathom why my manager suddenly started making my job and life impossible. The manager seemed to be only focused on self-preservation and felt threatened by my successes, so started putting up barriers in everything I did. I also had to be at mercy of my manager\u2019s moods - they could be unpredictable, voices raised, eyes rolled, meetings cancelled for no apparent reason. It was very confusing to me because I just wanted to do my job well.\n\nUnfortunately, working at Prostate Cancer involved a lot of backstabbing, politics, smoking downstairs with the right people, gossiping, begging for pay rises, holding people over barrels, blackmailing, being mates/going to the pub with the right people etc. For someone who wants to come to work to do their job this can be really exhausting and unnecessary, however unfortunately my manager thrived on that approach.\n\nAs was raised in other reviews - you may enjoy working here if you are white, British, able-bodied and ideally without caring responsibilities. That sets you up in good stead for flexible working requests, pay negotiations, flexility to do your job how you see fit and generally fit in. If you don\u2019t fit that profile - prepare to be excluded from everything, marginalised, blamed for everything and eventually pushed out (to be replaced by someone White British). The charity has all these lovely football and reading clubs etc and on paper \u201ceveryone is welcome\u201d but in reality you are only welcome if you fit the bill of a 25-35 year old white British person with a name like Holly or Jenny or Sam, else you can come, of course, but no one will talk to you. The people who work there seem delusional about how \u201cinclusive\u201d and \u201ckind\u201d they are when really if they look at themselves and people they call their friends and colleagues - they almost always look and talk the same. \n\nThe decisions made by leadership are very slow, risk averse and driven by fear (of potential legislation, of GDPR breaches and other unlikely events) rather than common sense. Team members who promote scaremongering of these unlikely scenarios seem to be received very well. Salaries have stagnated and haven\u2019t changed since 2018 falling a long way behind the market. Promotions on merit don\u2019t exist, but promotions for people whose managers are pushy/matey with the right directors etc are commonplace. \n\nOverall, the build up of unnecessary stress and bullying I experienced at this charity, mostly at the hands of a middle manager who did nothing and feared losing their job as a consequence, caused me lasting mental and physical health damage that may take years to repair. I am very happy to have moved on from the charity and knowing what I know now, I would never have joined it."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Openly Discriminates.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Team Sports Associate in Southwark, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Location\r\nnear station \r\nnice office\r\nSociable\r\nTeam sports", "cons": "Some real flaws deeply imbedded in the management - I\u2019d taken this role with real hope and belief that I would be supported and given time to progress.

My line manager was very inexperienced along with poor people skills. I was given another line manager as she was making the situation very stressful for me and was clearly out of her depth.\r\n\r\nIt then became clear they were trying to push me out of the door, they went though all the motions and ticked all the boxes so they couldn\u2019t be hit with a constructive dismissal claim. After bringing in additional support of whom pointed out they felt the charity were being unreasonable and felt this was boarding on disability discrimination. Even had my train times checked by my line manager due to a delay I had communicated, as he didn\u2019t believe or have faith in me. \r\n\r\nThis was the case as they started to ramp up the pressure and the unrealistic expectations. I was even at this point was getting counselling due to the stress and anxiety of the situation PCUK had put me through. Even to the point where I signed myself off sick. Even then they were guilt tripping me and suggesting my metal health issues were having a detrimental effect on the charity as I couldn\u2019t perform my role. I did put in a grievance out and called discrimination but they had there own people review this and it was clear they were only Interested in protecting themselves due to the bias and own panel of investigators.\r\n\r\nIf someone was in a wheelchair you would expect them to walk up a flight of stairs? Would you? Try walking a mile in the shoes of the person with a hidden disability who is battling a condition on a daily basis. PCUK didn\u2019t want to be inclusive enough but we\u2019re prepared to go through the motions and tick the right boxes in order for them to not be legally challenged.
