That is exactly what happened to this one. Many groups forget how to generate their own ideas and find their own external funding for research but rather purely rely on large companies funding their research, which is obviously also dictated by these companies. This situation definitely causing serious issues with lack of research freedom as the researchers are not allowed a single step outside the scope set by funder (who have specific business agenda).\r\nThe remote location of the campus is also a bad thing because to get to the closest reasonably sized supermarket or any other services takes at least 15-20 minutes by car or 30-60 minutes by bus. This is causing serious troubles when you need to solve some personal problems during lunch, because it is not possible (not enough time).\r\nThe employment contract is rather strange in this university. In normal universities (most of the UK) they never specify working hours and even the FTE equivalent number of hours per week is usually notional as you are required to fulfil your duties, but when and how many hours you will spend for this nobody cares and in most cases you are not required to be at the working place from 9 to 5 every working day. Here it is different. The contract specify working hours and many groups and departments actually enforces them. So, even in the regime of work it is more like a commercial consultancy than a proper university.\r\nWhen I was joining the university, I was accepting one job title and it turned out that it was changed later on without my knowledge. And because there is no proper job description, the work actually turned out to be on absolutely different topic, which I am not particularly interested in.\r\nI was also trying to find support for applications for external funding and could not find any, although was trying to contact various departments... They said that it is not in the core direction of the university and nobody will support it here...\r\nFinally, my contract is coming to an end really soon and by law (I found it later, but still on time) this is considered as a redundancy nevertheless what your arrangements outside your relationships with your current employer. And the employer has to pay you a Redundancy pay or offer similar (in terms of duties and pay) position, which you can (!) take. What the HR in this university was trying to do was to make me to write a resignation letter for the end of my contract saying that I have found another position after this one and this is not considered to be a redundancy. DO NOT WRITE OR SIGN ANYTHING!!! This is actually violation of the law from their side. Remember, you do not have to write and/or sign anything! And I mean anything.

Thus, they expect the PhD students to express significant abilities for autonomous work and self-management. While it IS expected that a PhD student is self-motivated and able to work well on their own, only consulting their supervisors when the most critical issues arise (it is highlighted in the book named \"How to get a PhD\"), some of the less-mature or guidance-dependent students may regard this as one of the most significant challenges.\r\n- Prepare to work hard.
