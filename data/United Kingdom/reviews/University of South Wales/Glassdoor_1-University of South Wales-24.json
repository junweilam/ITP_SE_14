It took over a month to be provided with a laptop which enabled me to effectively work from home (as was necessary due to Covid-19), during which time I was left to 'get on with my role' without having access to any documents or information that were absolutely necessary to carry out my job effectively. \r\nThe management that I experienced was extremely unprofessional, upsetting and biased; on multiple occasions I was verbally asked to carry out a piece of work, which I would complete, only then to receive a highly critical email (so there was written 'proof') telling me that I was never asked to do the work, had done it completely incorrectly, ignored instruction etc. In addition, the instructions were kept deliberately vague, giving the feeling that you are just being set up to fail. When I asked if these could be clarified, my manager replied that they 'earn too much to care about the detail'. \r\nThe manager of my team enforced long working days, of 12-13 hours, and if these hours were not kept, your professionalism and work ethic were brought into question. On numerous occasions, I was accused of being 'inappropriate' and 'unprofessional' merely as a result of asking for help and guidance with my new role. My fellow team members were constantly visibly stressed and worn down because of this environment, yet very little was done to ensure mental wellbeing, unless it 'ticked boxes'. \r\nWithin my team, and the wider student services, there was an extremely unpleasant culture of mean gossip, not only about colleagues but also the students we were tasked with helping. \r\nI witnessed, and experienced, multiple occasions of bullying from senior members of staff. When I raised this as an an issue, I was told that there is a hierarchy that I must respect, showing that this behaviour is not only tolerated, but actively encouraged. \r\nThe manager had certainly made up their mind that I was 'not fit for the role' (despite me having tried my absolute hardest on very little to no support given), and thus invited me to unwittingly carry out interviews for my replacement the day before I was invited for a 'casual' catch up with said manager, in which I experienced such a torrent of wild accusations, criticism and a general bullying attitude that I handed my notice in on the spot.

Member of staff who are not following their rules are considered as enemies and will have the same problem i.e. continuously monitored, deprived from all the social events or any useful information, they will completely isolated and continuously undermined. Managers do not have the skills and experience to deal with it and sometime they don't want to stop it...\r\n\r\n- No encouragement for research. University focused on teaching only.  University is loosing and looking for \"cheap\" staff so most of the hired lecturers don't have even a PhD and usually related to or a friend of a manager.
