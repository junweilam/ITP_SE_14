I think the office politics are really bad there, whereas in the projects we had no bad vibes at all and worked very well together.\r\n\r\nMy main gripe was that the work is really hardcore, but yet managers will just heap more and more and more on you. New residents are traumatised; they need you every day and heap story after story of abuse and heartache and unbelievably bad things onto you.  It is hard to cope with.  On top of this, you have managers at head office thinking of ways the service can improve and who has to do it?  The staff.  On top of everything else.  'Do this. Oh we forgot this idea; do it again. Oh yes, and this!! Yes, for all 96 clients you saw the last quarter.' No matter if residents are knocking on the door in tears, you're expected to redo work and tick little boxes. I really did feel like the staff were not respected and the reality of the role not understood.\r\n\r\nIn the end I'd say I kind of disliked the organisation while loving helping the clients, but the level of work was having a negative affect on me and periodically I would see incidents unfold where managers took against staff incorrectly, and I just felt alone in the role, and at risk from it.  Yes I felt at risk from the work and knew I would not be supported if push came to shove.  I felt hurt by that, after all the hard work I did for 11 years.
