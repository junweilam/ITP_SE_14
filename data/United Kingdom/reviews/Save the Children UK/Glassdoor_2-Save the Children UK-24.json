Even before its current restructure most staff felt broken by the unapproachable and unsupportive HR Leadership Team. There is no trust from the HRLT who demand that every little decision must go through them and it leaves competent staff second guessing every decision and is completely demotivating as well as being against the wider movement towards an agile way of working.\r\n\r\nThe department has gone through a restructure, while trying to continue to support the wider charity through COVID-19. No workloads have been lightened for people to properly engage with the process and if anything we are told that we have a huge strategy to deliver on. Opting to restructure a department during a global pandemic is debatable but the lack of comms, support and consistency has been nothing short of a disgrace. A huge amount of the team had no consultation notes recorded. No consultation feedback was shared back or used to redesign any element of the new structure. The rare timelines that were announced weren't kept to. The HRLT themselves have been confirmed into their new roles and have had their salaries matched accordingly while the rest of the team are still waiting months afterwards. We have weekly department meetings where the restructure is never mentioned and it's the elephant in the room. We are finding out by accident that colleagues are leaving and those leavers are actively told not to tell their colleagues which causes a huge amount of stress. Those people who have verbally been confirmed into new roles/slotted in havent received any letters. The new structure was supposed to encourage better career progression but its actually increased the gap for people to be able to progress up the ladder. The list goes on...it's like a handbook on how NOT to do it.\r\n\r\nStaff have asked for a way to provide feedback on the restructure and we were told that we could have 1:1s with members of the HRLT even though we know that there is no trust in the team (reflected in the HR staff survey results). We also know that no feedback would be acted on anyway it would only be a tick boxing exercise. Risk assessments of before and after the restructure need to be completed and shared widely including the diversity of the team. We are apparently \"recruiting for resilience\" implying that current staff don't possess it. But how much resilience are individuals expected to have after the way they are continuously being treated? We have had too many good workers go off with stress or leave the team already and there is a pattern.\r\n\r\nFor a HR department to get a restructure this wrong who's role it is to support other departments in doing this properly is unbelievably shocking. We dont have managers or leaders we have dictators who came in with an agenda and will do anything to get it."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Too much time spent soul-searching", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "27 May 2020", "job_title": "Communications in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Best place to work in the world when the stars align", "cons": "Far too much time spent soul-searching about 'the mission'; senior leaders offering little vision; not much career progression; salaries are average"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Getting better", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "13 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The people, the importance of the work.
