It really is an amazing charity to work for, and you can tell right away how passionate the staff are at providing optimal welfare for the cats and finding them suitable homes.\r\n\r\n* Management was very good at my centre. Booking time off and taking holiday was a breeze (however I always gave adequate notice). I felt listened to as a team member and feedback was discussed and fed up the chain. Unlike a lot of jobs, I felt like very comfortable discussing concerns and the like with my managers. They also took PMR's seriously and encouraged setting up goals for personal growth. I was booked on to all of the training courses available.\r\n\r\n*Training: Your experience may vary depending on centre and resources; I had a lot of one-to-one guidance from other staff members in the beginning who welcomed me with open arms and showed me the day to day in detail. It did not take long to pick it up with their help. Over my time there, I had the opportunity to attend teams meetings for training. These go in to depth on various important and relevant topics to the job - it was also an chance to network and see things from another centre's point of view. Very interesting topics too.\r\n\r\n* PPE and barrier nursing are taken very seriously - as they should be. There are no cutting corners when working at CP. In any animal boarding setting, there is a high risk of passing infectious pathogens between animals; and with a mix of healthy and vulnerable cats this is a serious threat. Fortunately CP are well aware of this, and all of the staff are very thorough. We had plenty of PPE supplies and training on orders of cleaning and awareness of fomites. I really respect the amount of effort put into maintaining this mindset.\r\n\r\n* Co-workers: Again, this will vary from person to person and centre to centre; but during my time here I could not fault a single person. Everyone was a pleasure to work with, and I formed some strong bonds during my team here. Working towards a common, moral goals that everyone felt passionate about is a huge motivator to work together properly. Of course, there were differing ideas at times but these are discussed and a fitting consensus reached. I felt so welcome and appreciated during my time here and I wish all the best to the team going forward.\r\n\r\n*Work-life balance: I worked four days a week - this was the contract I was offered, however it was a fitting life balance for me. The beauty of this job is looking forward to every shift. It was such a fun, rewarding job that I never woke up and begrudged going in. I easily could have worked more hours and felt content. I find the pay to be very fair for a position like this. I did not have special requests, but some of my co-workers had to do school runs in the morning, and another worked two other jobs and could only manage specific days. This was all fine and management helped work around their schedules. The company is also very generous with holidays; and I believe the longer you stay with the charity the more you will gain the following year.\r\n\r\n* Responsibility: Obviously, mistakes will happen and you learn from them. There is a lot of risk if the job is not carried out properly however, and you need to make sure you are putting in effort to do it correctly and mindfully. I found having responsibility, and trust from my managers and team to carry out my job to be very fulfilling. I have gained confidence not only from this, but from helping to train volunteers and from dealing with the public. This job offers a lot in terms of personal development and growth and I know the experience will stick with me, what I have learned will aid me greatly on my future ventures.\r\n\r\n*Exercise: Depends on what role you take on and which section of the charity you work for. I was on the ground, taking care of the cats. You will be on your feet for most of the day, lifting and bending and stretching. Deep cleans can be particularly tiring as we had very big pens. I enjoyed this aspect though, if you value 'getting your steps in' or keeping active and you would like to do that whilst you work then this job is awesome for that!\r\n\r\n* Cats: One of the best parts of the job was the interaction with cats. We have so many coming in and out, you really get to see so many quirky personalities and learn a lot about cat behaviour in practice. You will meet some of the most loving ex-strays, nervous multi-household cats, mothers and kittens, sometimes aggressive or temperamental cats. You will meet sick cats that need a little more effort to safe guard, and you will also face heartbreak in some sad cases. You get to play a part in making these cats comfortable, seeing positive shifts in their personality, helping socialise kittens and setting them up for the rest of their lives. Yes, volunteers get more one on one time playing and cuddling with them and actually working here means you will see them a little less, during cleaning, feeding and medication etc. but being in so frequently you really do get to know them. It was amazing. Seeing these cats go from scared and shy, to falling in love with a new owner is incredibly rewarding.", "cons": "My centre was split across two sites. It can be a little difficult coordinating supplies, passing information and driving to two separate places at times.\r\n\r\nWhilst the online system was good, at times it was impossible to access. Couple that with poor wifi signal on site and it could be frustrating trying to organise the paperwork aspect of things.\r\n\r\nSometimes, hearing what the cats background and what they have been through can be very upsetting and it's easy to get angry about it. Of course everyone was amicable with the public, but if you cannot keep calm and deal with it appropriately this may not be the role for you."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Carings employers", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "23 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Cat Care Assistant in Newbury, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Caring employers\r\nPlenty of training and opportunities to grow", "cons": "Nothing about thing company itself, but some of the situations that cats will come from can be upsetting."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Wonderful place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "5 Aug 2022", "job_title": "IT Services Technician in Chelwood, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great place and people to work with.", "cons": "I can't think of any except career path in IT is limited."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Review of a former employee", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Front Desk Receptionist in Bridgend, Wales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There are no pro's for this company", "cons": "Did not come up to expectations as kept questioning me about me about my disability and my medical conditions how it would effect my ability to work.
