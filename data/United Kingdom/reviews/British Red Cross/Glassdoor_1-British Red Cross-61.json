I was in a role that had me interact with lots of different parts of the organisation and while none of them are in a good place I\u2019d say the cons vary a bit depending on where you are.\r\n\r\nIn general\r\n\r\nPoor quality leadership/unfair advancement: especially at the higher echelons of the organisation leadership is shockingly mediocre, often promoted due to office politics or due to being mates with higher-ups. A couple of times I ran into people at senior level who had been transferred elsewhere in the organisation and knew less about the brief for their department than new starters. Most of the organisation (not all teams but majority) is generally more focused on appearing to be successful than actually doing well and there\u2019s a big culture of overly inflating results to try and show you\u2019re getting results, and ignoring actual problems.  Quite a lot of middle managers spend a lot of time covering for their heads/directors. I think the chief executive himself is fairly competent but unfortunately he relies entirely on what he hears from his senior staff so is largely responding to a series of fictions.\r\n\r\nBurnout: people are worked really hard, with deadlines set with little understanding of the reality of the work involved (in part due to be aforementioned leadership issues). This leads to a lot of issues with burnout (line management training treated your staff signing off due to stress as unavoidable and a common event\u2026), one of the most common points for people to leave is at six months in and few people last more than 18 months\r\n\r\nOn boarding is atrocious: people routinely didn\u2019t get the contract in time (a couple of weeks after they started was seen as normal), people often wouldn\u2019t have phones or accounts properly set up and in some cases this got really problematic if people had to handle sensitive information. This is particularly exacerbated by issues with turnover (people are not there long so something that messes up their first couple of months is a big chunk of them)\r\n\r\nBullying: not something I ran into a huge amount while I was there myself but I knew many people who had a really big problem with bullying/aggressive management style,  particularly from the most senior parts of the organisation (the three worst offenders I was aware of, including the only one I ran into personally, are/were all directors). \r\n\r\nDiversity/tokenism: they desperately want to appear friendly to diversity but it\u2019s all very tokenistic. Disabled people are so intimidated by HR they tend to hide their status, loads of micro aggressions towards BAME community; generally not a nice place to be if you don\u2019t fit the mould.\r\n\r\nVery poor management staff relations: there\u2019s been a lot of badly planned and botched restructurings in the last few years and some teams have been quite redundancy happy. This, coupled with all the above problems, have led to really bad staff management relations. The senior leadership is absolutely terrified of this leading to unionisation which they\u2019re very hostile to (especially the chief executive) but they\u2019ve not provided a workable alternative\r\n\r\nIn many teams you don\u2019t get make a difference: probably the worst thing you can say for a job in the charity sector, all of the above has a real impact on effective service delivery. I left after I realised I wasn\u2019t able to use my time to best help people in crisis, which after all should be what everyone in the organisation is there to do.\r\n\r\nSpecific team/functions\r\n\r\nThe administrative functions and people and learning are badly underfunded, with people provided insufficient training and no real way to pull levers in the wider organisation to actually make things work better. \r\n\r\nFrontline staff are very poorly paid: it\u2019s more of a mixed bag when you get to the support roles or middle management but people on the front line are paid very badly even for the sector.\r\n\r\nPoor communication between the centre and the periphery: people based in small local offices tend to be rather out on their own/lack support.
