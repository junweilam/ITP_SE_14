Where once it stood for academic excellence and well-produced academic publishing, it now stands for dysfunctional management, appalling staff relations and a complete lack of  attention to its product. At the end of the day, the 'brand' survives on trust and respect of its customers, and how can the customers be expected to invest in that when the staff cannot?\r\n\r\nImaginative, clever and innovative staff have little to no means of progression. The organisation is laughably top-heavy, with so many levels of management that no decisions are ever taken in the interests of the long-term future of the company, but only ever in the short-term interests of the managers. Think the wonderful TV Series W1A and you have working at CUP in a nut shell!\r\n\r\nThere is no appreciation of staff. There is no respect of staff. There is no consideration of staff. It amazes me that management do not see that an under-appreciated, de-motivated, dissatisfied workforce that is coming in to work every single day fearful that there will be yet another round of 're-structures' and management desk-shuffling announced, is not likely to be willing or capable of producing good results. The best asset any company has is its staff, and CUP fail spectacularly to appreciate this. \r\n\r\nIt is an organisation where top management have no interest whatsoever in the long-term future of their staff. That means that talented and knowledgeable people, who CUP have 'trained' simply walk out of the door to other companies. That is an enormous waste, and is bleeding the company dry.\r\n\r\nThe lack of compassion and sensitivity shown is staggering. When the almost weekly 'restructures' are announced and people are yet again concerned for their jobs there is no sensitivity shown or understanding - it always communicated as 'in the best interests of the business'. Of course, it is always notable that what is 'best for the business' is for those on the lowest rungs of the ladder to lose their jobs whilst middle managers (and those higher up, where the biggest mistakes are made of course)  amazingly retain theirs. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to work in an environment where you are valued, look elsewhere. If you wish to work in an environment where your imagination and initiative will be rewarded, look elsewhere.

But overall the workload was about right for a full-time job.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months the department was subjected to a restructure, which seems to have been very poorly planned and implemented by management, and has caused utter chaos. Many people found their job roles changed and were offered very little training to cope with their new responsibilities. Workloads that staff were expected to deal with rose to totally unmanageable levels, many book projects ground to a virtual halt. Staff have been left feeling very stressed and unsupported, and not surprisingly they have started to leave on a weekly basis, many of whom who had worked at the Press for years and had a wealth of experience (just the people you would want to be keeping). These are then replaced with younger and less experienced staff, brought in on short term contracts, who require training, and so it goes on with an endless cycle of new staff and training - nobody in their right mind would tolerate the current job roles for very long.
