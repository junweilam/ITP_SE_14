The re-structure overall was handled appallingly with no empathy whatsoever from senior management. I had been in a situation where I was undermined in large meetings. I raised what happened with my line manager saying I even thought they enjoyed putting me down in the meeting. They said they probably did and this went no further. Senior managers: The outcome of the restructure was the opposite of what the BHF needed. The 'doers' i.e. the people whose jobs involve delivering the strategy were stripped back, whilst new senior management roles were created. We needed more senior managers like a hole in the head. Bureaucracy: the BHF is scared to acknowledge the main reason for new initiatives not happening is the lack of ability to collaborate effectively. Teams are thrown together with no training on how to work together or in some cases even what their roles and responsibilities are. New initiatives are taken around the houses and torn to pieces by Directors before they've had the chance to be tested with actual supporters. Good ideas and bad ideas look the same at the start and senior managers personal opinions are more valued than expertise and supporter input. This led to poor decision making, underperforming campaigns and people left in their droves. Shifting priorities: I understand change is constant, but senior management would change the direction at the drop of a hat. At times, this meant 6 months + of work was now completely redundant - this was happening regularly so people felt they were having no positive impact (at worst a negative impact) for the charity and often a cause they care deeply about. This was sometimes seen as something we just had to put up with rather than address. Busy work: There was a huge amount of busy work being completed. By this I mean, spending days making powerpoint presentations look nice for senior managers and sitting in poorly structured meetings."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Diss, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Benefits, good working environment and team", "cons": "Always increasing targets each year"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Accountant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great working dynamic.

work with.\r\n\r\nCompany offers coniderable benefits package - 30 days holiday, gym subsidy, dental insurace and the like.", "cons": "Before anything else is said I would like to mention to whoever might be reading this that this review portrays the situation specificly at Ebay department in Leeds, \r\nplease consider this while reading the overall reviews for BHF which are mostly made for jobs at local stores and by volounteers which might not neccesarily be indicative of what awaits you at Ebay position.\r\n\r\nOver my nearly five years working at BHF I've been witness to the slow, gradual decline of the company from the best place I've ever worked at\r\nto a very unique blend of a ruthless corporation and charity organization which somehow manages to offer the very worst of both worlds without the benefits of either.\r\n\r\nUpper management seems obssesed with targets and will push hard for high performance completely disregarding the reality of the situation on the ground,\r\nstock levels are often times simply too low or of too low quality to consistently achieve demanded targets and while on the surface level management will acknowledge that there is a problem they will still require you to meet the demands all the same - whether by rushing at exausting pace or worse by processing stock that has no chance of getting actually sold just so that the numbers on the end of week report excell sheet look good.\r\n\r\nThere isn't much to be said about career progression or development because those simply do not exist, everything ends on dangling empty promises of promotions and useless in-house courses that never end with anything substanial.\r\nCurrent staff is most of the times overlooked or completely ignored when better vacancies open. \r\nI wouldn't have to use fingers on both of my hands to count the number of people that got advanced to a higher a role during my time at BHF.\r\n\r\nEspecially in recent years the company has been increasingly having this sweatshop feel with the ever higher employee turnover, disregard for long standing loyal employees that still choose to remain and difficult work enviroment with poor equipment - all this while offering salary that is below market average.\r\n\r\nWhen asking about pay, equipment or suggesting changes to the way stock and work in general are being handled the suggestions and ideas are quickly dismissed under the argument of BHF being a charity and being unable to afford any investment into the staff all the while openly boasting about record high sales week after week in the company communcations - however when talking to you about targets and performance BHF undergoes momentary transformation into \"we are business and we need to make money\" resulting in nothing ever changing aside from staff morale consistently sinking.\r\n\r\nWhile my time at BHF has been an overall good memory, mostly because of the early years and friends I've made at it's current state I would say it's probably decent enough as a part-time job for a student or someone looking for something quickly while in-between jobs but I could not in good faith recommend this company for anyone looking to start a meaningful career."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career

You also often will have to end up opening slightly earlier and leaving slightly later with no option to put this through as overtime to reflect the extra time and effort that the role requires, in terms of my actual experience in the store:\r\n\r\nThe first day i arrived at the store after being trained, my manager and me got into a disagreement due to her using cellotape to attach the end of day receipts together, I advised that using a stapler would be more effective and it took me a full month to convince her to actually use a stapler (additionally a stapler was used instead in the Grays store which seemed to show the manager would just run it differently due to personal preference)\r\n\r\nA big one: When my grandad passed away naturally the volunteers were upset, my manager had been talking about it behind my back asking why \"id been upset about it , its just his grandad\". I confronted her about it and immediately got into a verbal confrontation to the point where i very nearly left the company and would've gone on social media about it as its completely disgusting for a Manager in a charity shop who is supposedly caring in regards to bereavments (as the charity often deals with customers/donaters who have lost family members) to be making inappopriate comments regarding this.\r\n\r\nI also only got 2 days leave to actually go to the funeral which was in Scotland so barely had time to even attend the funeral due to travel times and costs. Due to the inability to find time off i also was unable to visit my Grandad before he passed away from cancer. Im sure if it had been a heart condition it would've been very very different. I believe a different store manager would've been more supportive in this situation. \r\n\r\nMy manager was very rude, and would often make snide remarks or digs about former members of staff who had left. This also included regarding the volunteers who the manager clearly had a case of favouritsm with (if she did not like you she would often blank your questions and not be supportive, ive heard she has also gone on to do this to other staff since i had left the role) \r\n\r\nMy manager was unable to deal with a complaint regarding our Sunday staff member who was violating health and safety rules (leaving glass on the floor, leaving large donations on the shop floor, the volunteers all complained to me about this and i approached her to help me deal with the situation) she ended up asking me to email HR which the staff member then saw and caused further disruptions because she did not want to deal with the problem herself. Something she even admitted where he had been breaking the health and safety rules for a year at this point. This caused a massive disruption to the management of the store that could have been resolved if she has supported me effectively and actually dealt with the problem instead of pushing it onto someone else and not dealing with it as a result. \r\n\r\nMy manager broke the accepting donation rules: At the store we were based in we were not allowed to take electrical goods or furniture due to not being the appropriate store for these items. I would often approach donaters who tried to donate these items and inform them of our policy and alternative stores where they could donate these products appropriately.

Keeps you fit", "cons": "Overworked, underpaid, very stressful, not valued, diabolical health & safety, poor working conditions, no care for paid staff let alone volunteers who give time freely, trackers for everything, unrealistic targets to name a few!\r\nAs a manager I am very outgoing, love new challenges and have a lot of drive, this company how ever have sucked every last ounce of passion out of me to the point they have finally broken me and I am currently seeking new employment!\r\nThe biggest problem is lack of measure in change. Don't get me wrong they are the best at what they do as a charity retailer on the high street, but what is shown to the public on the shop floors is far cry from what happens behind the scenes.\r\nShops generally consist of a paid manager, assistant manager and paid assistant if you lucky, the rest of the team is made up of good hearted volunteers some of who work as though it is a full time job!\r\nThe back working areas are horrendous, no space for storage and mounds of stock (if you're doing the job correctly) the environments are more than often dangerous. There is a huge problem when it comes to getting any form of repairs done, you are often told \"that will cost too much money\" so jobs are always bodged.\r\nShops have to work with rats/fleas/un-safe equipment etc.\r\nWhen you try to communicate problems the area managers who are equally under as much pressure seem to live in fear of the regional managers so things often get swept under the carpet.\r\nWhen a visit is due from anyone higher up you are told to make sure everything is clear, totally unrealistic as for one it takes a good week to sort it out and two it does not allow the real daily working environment that we work in to be seen!\r\nCurrently I am working with 9 different trackers! These generally are the brain wave of an area manager that is then shared amongst all the others. These trackers are repetitive in their nature. Then you have the conference call scenario, there is around 15 shop managers on one call, these take up so much time as you are always waiting for people to dial in who are late, then you can't hear a thing due to all the background noise and the area manager is constantly telling people to be quiet, these calls can last up to 40 minutes a time and some days you end up having 3. This is all detracts from being able to run your store and achieve targets of 250 hanging items to the shop floor each day. Whilst sitting on a call you see the donated stock flowing up the stairs and know your workload has just doubled. If it's a day where volunteers don't turn up and you are short staffed you don't stand a chance! Then you are made to feel incompetent when your stock hasn't hit the shop floor because you have been tied up in conference calls throughout the day.\r\nMy store receives around 500 bags per week, which if you saw the size of the store you would understand, if you don't work that stock continually you have major problems.\r\nMore recently the company have become suddenly OCD about health and safety, sending managers on risk assessment courses, great yes but all it's doing is passing the buck back down to the store manager if anything goes wrong, we were told we would be the ones who would serve time in prison if we don't keep on top of it all and accident occur, yet they refuse to spend money on improvements that are desperately needed! They take on cheap rents to be able to maximise their profits.\r\nFundraising..... Where to start! The company has its own fundraising department who appear to have the easy job, as the small stores are expected to fundraise daily, targets often set at \u00a350 per day, you are expected to turn it in to a \"fun\" challenge for your volunteers, believe me there is no fun in this at all, you have no choice but to send your best volunteer out to collect this money which then leaves you short handed in the store. Volunteers who are vulnerable and there are many in these stores are the preferred ones to go out collecting as they have the \"pity factor\" it's disgusting! However if you are like me and many other managers you more often then not end up putting your own money in the collection so you don't feel worthless when you have to report your figures on yet another conference call.\r\nGift Aid, the company expects a minimum of 5 new sign ups per day and a 40% conversion rate each week on gift aid sales, the pressure from this leads to many managers fiddling the gift aid system i.e using donor id's from a person who hasn't actually donated any stock recently. This is a grave concern as this is illegal and an imprisonable offence by the HMRC, but this is what the company's expectations are doing to store managers. When you are honest and speak up about the pressure you are told that there are worst company's and bigger pressures that you could be working for and that maybe you are just not cut out for the job.\r\nThere is no consistency with plans, organisation or communication. You are spoken to very rudely by certain departments when you have a problem.\r\nThis company spend an awful lot of time sending out emails and surveys but never actually do anything about the results that have been given from them except to send out yet another glossy, colourful piece of laminated art work to place on the staff notice board that nobody ever reads as they simply don't have time.\r\n\r\nI really wish that more outside organisations would really start looking at these stores as I know they would serve notices and close them down, the danger is very worrying especially when you have vulnerable people volunteering for you.\r\n\r\nI have met Peter Hollins once during my 12 years in the company,  he was a lovely gentleman, he did mention he was a little shocked at the conditions but then disappeared back to London, of course everything was spick and spam for the visit!\r\n\r\nThere are no real incentives as such working here apart from a 25% discount on donated stock. Bonuses are now virtually impossible to make due to the recent restructuring of the bonus scheme. There are no health packages, child care vouchers or anything else, yet the regional support managers/ area managers/ regional managers all get health packages/ phones/ lap tops and cars. I dread to think how much all of this costs, there are so many wasted and needles roles in this company that could save hundreds of thousands of pounds that could go towards more research.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare you see much bad press about them as things are kept quiet and they have an excellent legal team. They are very clever at getting rid of problems if a disgruntled person comes forward.\r\n\r\nThis organisation needs investigating at a very deep level especially when it comes to wasting people's generous donations.\r\n\r\nAm I an angry employee? Absolutely! After 12 years of giving everything I have, I have now finally woke up to the sad reality that I have been a victim of nothing more than what can only be deemed as a cult! \r\nThere is so much more than what I have written here, but I am so overwhelmed with it all I am aware I have vented too much.\r\n\r\nWhen I have gained a new position and got away from this place I fully intend to expose the whole lot to the national media and anyone who will listen with the evidence I have built.\r\n\r\nGood luck to any new potential employees, you have been warned."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great place with Great opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Apr 2019", "job_title": "Program Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "working with a large group of like minded, talented people who have the same goal in mind which is to make a difference and help save lives\nHaving good exposure to all different types of technology, ways of working and delivering life changing projects and programmes  \nopen to ideas and new ways of working to help depts. and functions across the organisation", "cons": "Some of the facilities could do with updating at some of the offices (I know that's being looked into)"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Sales assistant", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Oct 2016", "job_title": " in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lovely lower paid members of staff and volunteers", "cons": "Company doesn't look for people who work hard and loyal, promotion is based on how far you crawl up your area managers backside or if your face fits treatment.

If you don't have enouhg stock to hit target, you will be chastised. If you have enough, they will complain at you for listing items that are too low value.\r\nThey are the ones providing you with stock and yet you somehow end up being the one taking the blame for it.\r\nThere is a distinct disregard for the wellbeing of all employees.\r\nThere are posters and meetings that all frequently discuss mental wellbeing, and yet I've never known a workplace to feature so many employees who are clearly suffering from severe mental duress.\r\nDepression and mental illness was a common topic of conversation amongst staff, and often the consesus was that the department is the cause of it.\r\nFrom what I heard from other listers, multiple people actively quit due to mental health concerns in the past.\r\nOne of the managers is known to have actively said he believes stress makes people work better, and seemingly acknowledges and justifies the poor treatment of his employees because he beleives it will lead to better numbers.\r\nThat seems to be the major issue here, that the managers simply care so little about their staff and are happy to see them suffer if it means they can make more money.\r\nThere is seemingly no career progression whatsoever. I'm not sure I saw a single person ever receive a promotion during my time there?\r\nThere were plenty of people who would voluntarily do extra work, go out of their way to prove themselves and so often their eagerness was simply exploited by the management. They would make empty promises and in time people would grow tired of doing the extra work and seemingly be blamed when they want to go back to their regular jobs after realising all the extra work they were putting in meant nothing.\r\nThere are occasional social gatherings outside of work, which can be good fun as a lot of the coworkers are a delight, and it was honestly one of the more releiving experiences to realise just how many others that worked there had the same negative feelings towards the job, but these are rare and often seem to devolve into odd rumour spreading and gossip mongering. It's hard to say what is and isn't true but some of the things people seem to believe goes on in that building is quite shocking, though I imagine maybe talking about such things is one of the few ways employees let off steam and manage to cope with their working conditions.\r\nDuring my time in the eBay department I routinely saw examples of sexism and racism outright denied or dismissed by management, on one occasion one individual went to submit a complaint about sexual misconduct and was actively encouraged not to submit a complaint to HR by a manager.\r\nThese issues are treated as an inconvenience, something to be dealt with so that everybody can get back to work rather than the serious issues they clearly are.\r\nI can't speak for the rest of the BHF and how it is, people from outside of the eBay department visited on occasion and often seemed pleasant enough, but every time visitors were coming eBay management would make a big show and dance of cleaning up and hiding away the rough edges to make the eBay department appear much more competent than it really is.\r\nThey would hand pick a few people to talk to visitors, pretend that everything was running in a smooth and orderly manner and the visitors would leave impressed with the falsehood they had been shown. I would love to see what a lot of these people would think if they saw the mess of a true day to day in that building. But maybe they know and are equally happy to just let the place run as it is as long as the money keeps coming in. I'm not sure if many people ever tried to contact HR or upper management to discuss the problems in the department, those I talked to just seemed to be under the impression that any attempt was pointless, either because eBay management had persuaded them that is the case or because attempts in the past had gone nowhere.\r\n\r\nI honestly can't encourage you enough to avoid working here. Other jobs have their stresses and bad days, but I've never known anywhere to be as consistently miserable."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Friendly and supportive environment", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "22 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Claygate, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The site that I work at is very friendly and the social side has improved over the years.
