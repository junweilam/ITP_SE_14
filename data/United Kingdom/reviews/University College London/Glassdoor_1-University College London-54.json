Funding for conferences, work equipment etc. is left completely at the discretion of the supervisor. Unfortunately I had a very stingy supervisor, meaning I had to either find my own funding, or not attend conferences at all.\r\n- Badly organised and inefficient HR and admin for the department. Every time my salary needed to be adjusted (typically every 6-12 months), something would go wrong on the admin side, and I would either end up underpaid or not paid at all. As a student on a 17k annual salary living in London, not being paid for a month means that rent and bills can't get paid. This normally takes several weeks of chasing up and sorting before the payment arrives. This happened 5 or 6 times throughout my 4-year PhD.\r\n- Inefficient system to claim back expenses, from conferences or work-related costs. Several times I ended up just paying out of pocket for conferences, because the rules for claiming back expenses kept changing, and I was treated very harshly for 'doing it wrong' (despite not knowing the rule changes at the time). Seems like a UCL way of trying to retain as much money as possible. \r\n- Lack of departmental funding for events. There is a HUGE discrepancy between the amount of funding each department has. When I was on the PhD committee, we had a budget of \u00a320 PER EVENT (which happened every fortnight). This was for a huge department consisting of 10s of PhD students.

First I found extremely useful all the university services such as the Career and Doctoral training services, with plenty of non-academic courses and events being organised during the term. Second, being in London is a fantastic opportunity to network. If you are interested in staying in academia you can visit people at nearby universities to discuss your results or to solve possible obstacles in your research. Its incredible how many conferences and science divulgation events are organised in London, you just have to keep your eyes open. If on the other side you are not interested in academia, but after a PhD you want to move into a industry...well, in London you can find Industries in all the possible fields, so even in that case it is easy to find good opportunities.", "cons": "What I mostly disliked is that UCL is so central in London that all the facilities are badly distributed and of very low quality. Recently there has been a continuous refurbishment of obsolete areas around the Uni, so I guess that UCL is trying to invest strongly on new buildings and new areas.

This is common, widespread knowledge amongst staff, yet despite this, and innumerable complaints from multiple staff members to those in a position of power and authority (directors), no action is taken to eradicate this unprofessional and harmful behaviour.\r\n\r\nConsequently, there has been an exodus of excellent, intelligent and qualified people who have sought employment at other HE institutions, leaving behind poor employees who have no place in customer services. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the departmental HR team is in complete disarray and you're lucky if you get paid correctly from month to month. I know of several colleagues who have claimed and received large amounts of compensation due to the ineptitude of this team.\r\n\r\nFurther cons include:\r\n- an absence of support and motivation from your superior\r\n- no career progression opportunities\r\n- an absence of basic training to fulfil your role\r\n- ironically, it's a non-challenging and non-stimulating environment\r\n- an inability to contribute ideas and suggestions  - no opportunities are extended and feedback offered freely is dismissed\r\n- poor standard of/inadequate staff facilities \r\n- dirty environment which attracts pests (the cleaners are fantastic and do the best they can.
