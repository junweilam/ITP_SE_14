At band 4, my salary is barely ahead of minimum wage (band 2 is the lowest salary). There are other people on the same band as me who line manage people, which is crazy for the money they are on. I know the government set NHS salaries, but still, I could be earning more elsewhere for the same sort of role. The policy on working from home isn't great. I could do almost 100% of my work from home, but need to be on site 3 days a week out of 5. I could do 4 days at home and the quality of my work would still be very good. The clinical staff work very hard and are overworked, but it's the same with admin staff as well. It's normal for people to work extra hours for free. Management don't ask for, or expect it, but so many people do, because they're conscious that things won't get done otherwise, which has an impact on patients. Clearly there is a problem with admin teams being too small for the huge workloads. I've seen people cry because of the stress."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "5 May 2023", "job_title": "Senior Pharmacy Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Allowed to self manage and trusted to get on with job", "cons": "Lots of staff who do not pull their weight.
