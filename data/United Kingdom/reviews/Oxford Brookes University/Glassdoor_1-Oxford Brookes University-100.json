A factor which brings both advantages and difficulties for the institution. The city is beautiful and a great place to live. However it has a a high cost of living and house prices are exceedingly high in relation to lecturer wages. The tired university buildings are slowly being demolished to make way for a new campus. Generally a friendly and congenial place to work . The students are mostly of a good standard for what is, in effect, an ex poly, - though many of them are very much grade focused. Relatively few students show any passion for their chosen subject. The university does want to see research take off but it is not a strategic priority and it is unlikely to happen without proper strategic investment which is unlikely to be forthcoming..", "cons": "The impression is that the senior management are remote and cold. Academics are not listened to or consulted about meaningful decisions regarding the university and its core policies - or at least that is the impression most of us get. Consultation is usually done as lip service when a decision has already been made. Obsessive restructuring and attempts at teaching 'innovation' - usually without an evidential basis for their effectiveness. Highly centralised academic management system which is often procedure-obsessed and frequently acts against the interest of students in ways which academics are unable to influence. \r\nResearch takes very much a back foot.  Expect long working hours if one wants to have any research career of any kind -it gets pushed into the evenings and weekends.\r\nThe university frequently attracts high calibre academics but few of these last more than a few years once they realise how the place operates. Most are worn down by the petty bureaucracies, high workloads and appalling facilities. The library is terrible - lacking many mainstream journals. Ultimately the place is incompatible with being a serious researcher  Other issues are the lack of proper IT support -all of it is centralised and slow to respond and focused on teaching. There is little to no technical support for research. The university lacks a proper 'research culture' - there is no intellectual 'buzz' from working at the university - most departments have several members of lecturing staff that do no research at all, which doesn't help."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Trying to improve on a very tight budget, with limited success", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 Mar 2013", "job_title": "Senior Lecturer in Oxford, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "In Oxford - good student town, Nice area for employees too.

Severe lack of research-active staff of professorial rank to provide leadership for research-active junior faculty, and to facilitate success with external grant applications.  Higher than average staff turnover with strict recruitment moratorium currently in force on replacements, leading to ever higher workloads for remaining faculty and reduced time available for servicing needs of students.  Teaching very difficult over last few years due to noise and disruption from building works.  University spread over several geographically isolated campuses, making coordination difficult.  Quality and dedication of teaching staff highly variable.  Not much social interaction between teaching staff - no common rooms and very few after-work drinks. \r\nStrategic focus is entirely about increasing revenue by finding additional sources of income, as well as improving student satisfaction to maintain recruitment.  While the latter is laudable and has led to a more responsive and student-focused system, there still remain a lot of contributory factors that have nothing to do with quality of the lecturer or module leader.  The standard duration of all teaching sessions is 3 hours, making it challenging to maintain students' attention and enthusiasm for the entire duration.  Quality of teaching environment is highly variable, ranging from the modern, light, comfortable classrooms featured on the website and prospectus, to dingy, 1970's polytechnic-style rooms with uncomfortable plastic chairs that are not cleaned regularly enough.
