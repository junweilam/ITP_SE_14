I could write an excerpt similar to war and peace after my experience. Rampant bullying of staff by higher management who to be fair you have never even met. Just before I left we all had personalised letters regarding attendance of students amounting to bullying tactics. No mention of the sheer incompentence of the progress leaders (nobody knows exactly what they do about from strutting round the building thinking they own it and occasionally find the strength to make a phone call home). You could have reported an issue to progress leaders and ive had emails ignored. Its utterly disgraceful how they manage their own caseload of students. Similarily some of the teaching assistants who had been there years thought they owned the place and where interested in keeping a lid on issues rather than supporting students. There is a culture of 'ive been here years so I can say what i like' regardless of being to be frank not very good at their jobs. I always felt it needed a really good clear out of the dead wood of the TA's. The support of disabled students is clearly an issue in an already stretched support team and this became apparent quite soon after i started 3 years ago. Apparently its ran by someone (manager) who is not even the building and I genuinely never met once in 3 years. I know some students in my classes had dyslexia issues and were still waiting for an assessment almost 18 months after starting the course which is utterly appalling. I know some other students with EHCP Plans that is essentially a legally binding contract not being provided support in class for weeks sometimes several months on end. Bullying is also an issue I know of several colleagues who were bullied by higher management when they decided to honour us with their prescence in a classroom space despite you simply giving 110% in reality towards your teaching and supporting the students. Its not a place for a fulfilled teaching career; its where you go to kill your career and passions for teaching. Its good as a starter to learn the further education system - then move on before it turns you into something you don''t want to be. Pay is absolutely appalling. I could have earnt more working an Amazon warehouse.

OFTED grades quickly crashed from Grade 1 to a disastrous Grade 4 and observations of teaching and learning went from once every two years (if there were no immediate problems identified) to 6 times a year. This policy was unworkable. \r\n\r\nThis twelve-fold increase in scrutiny was a clear indicator that staff were no longer to be trusted but implicitly blamed for the OFSTED collapse since the change in \u201cleadership\u201d. It poisoned good will and devastated morale but was only one very damaging element in a far larger change in attitude.  \r\n\r\nFor me, a caustic atmosphere of bullying eventually led to a breakdown in any meaningful communication with line management.

The college was haemorrhaging long standing experienced staff and all the years of dedication that went with that, (particularly as union reps who challenged this seemed to be loosing their jobs at a shocking level). \r\n\r\nThe grievance procedures were ineffective, communication was hierarchical and one way, listening to staff concerns was extremely rare and many of us considered that our positions were made untenable. \r\n\r\nThe level of stress and damage to wellbeing after decades of faithful service cannot be forgiven.
