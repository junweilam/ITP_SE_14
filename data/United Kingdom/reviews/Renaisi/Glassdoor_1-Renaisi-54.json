I was provided a line manager, a senior project manager who was new to his role a few weeks after I joined. I did not receive a proper induction from HR or any support for my learning difficulty of dyslexia, all of which I had raised on my application form and interview process. My line-manager blamed HR for this yet he himself did not take the initiative to peruse this support  until I pushed this.  Given that I was new to the world of work, I did not know what support I could receive and therefore, as I have always done, did my best to not let these challenges affect my work. Although at first I felt welcomed into the team, over time, the working culture in the head office felt corporate, individualistic and departmental, heavily reliant on how well you knew senior staff.\r\n\r\nI gave my very best to my work and inspite of the work itself being monotonous and repetitive, I believed it was a crucial step for me to learn how to understand the programme I was working for. I put in extra time, working when I was on sick leave and until 8pm at night for several months due to the high work load and lack of staff on the programme. I was subject to horrendous micromanagement, cold behaviour and I constantly felt undermined by both a Senior project manager (my line manager) and another staff member who evidently wanted to prove they could manage and assert their authority.  Although the line manager I had took me out for one-to-ones, it was mainly him doing the talking and all about how to \"impress\". I never felt he genuinely cared about my progress or interests.\r\n\r\nI was put on a probation plan 6 months later for reasons I strongly feel I didn\u2019t deserve and of which reflected my learning difficulty.  For someone who has always been praised for their work ethic and positive attitude, this came to me as a shock. I was subject to appalling emails and condescending comments from my manager. I would be penalised for the smallest errors, even when it was my first time doing a task such as producing reports based on financial data. I had actively seeked support from other colleagues and him to make sure I was doing it right.  Although we had frequent meetings about my 'progress', they often lacked purpose and where I could have spent that time giving my best to my job. I never once felt he or aNetwork Manager I was working for sincerely cared about my wellbeing or progress. My probation plan was dropped 2 weeks after they had realised they had failed in providing essential support that I needed and I had complained about their management style. After this, they started the process of providing me with some support and I did see a change in their management style. I'm disappointed that it took all this time for them to provide me with this support. Had I not complained or disputed it, they would have continued with their passive-aggressive bullying behaviour.  In addition to this, I don't feel I was given the same opportunities as other Project Officers had received. \r\n\r\nMy manager's manager had sympathised with me and apologised for the behaviour I had endured, yet he approached me with \u2018what are we going to do with you\u2019. This was evident to me of how much this organisation lacked in sensitivity towards employees with additional needs. I stuck this behaviour out for a year and I was encouraged to leave this job several times by doctors, mentors and another manager and colleague at Renaisi who empathised with my experience. Giving my notice and leaving this job was the best thing I did for myself and my health.  \r\n\r\nThe only time I really felt listened was when a new HR manager joined the team before I left. I am hoping the working culture and sensitivity awareness for people that have additional needs has improved.  It was an exhausting and emotional experience where I didn't feel I was growing professionally or personally.   As this was my first graduate job, I am disappointed with how I was treated. Since leaving Renaisi, I have been able to enjoy working and have experienced what it is like to have a supportive and caring manager and be a part of a team where I feel like an equal."}], []]
