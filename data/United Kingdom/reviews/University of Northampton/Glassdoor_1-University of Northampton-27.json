It is mainly a teaching university with increasing focus on vocational, employability and money making courses. \r\n\r\nIn about three years time the university will be leaving a lovely leafy campus downsizing to move to a much smaller inner city campus.  The reduction in physical space means that academic staff will no longer have private offices and there will be no lecture halls.  There will be limited, if any, facilities for student and staff parking. \r\n\r\nThe decision to sell the existing campus and borrow a lot of money to build a new smaller campus was quite sudden and not based on any rationale. No compelling reason for the sale was communicated to staff.  No options were discussed and staff were not consulted in any meaningful or effective way.

This means that experienced staff have been cut and retiring staff not replaced. Budgets for conference and research have been limited, and support for academic events is offered on the basis of the potential earnings the enterprise may bring in.\r\n\r\nIn order to try to meet the reduction in staff educational and support services have been mechanised  with over reliance on central electronic systems.  the consequence of this is that academic staff are asked to fill in the gaps and do more and more work that previously would have been undertaken by administrative and support staff. The systems appear to be introduced almost on an ad hoc basis without any consultation or reason being given.\r\n\r\nThe disregard  for academic autonomy and freedom is reflected in the use of metrics and manipulation of staff to promote a corporate plan and marketing image."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent working environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Sept 2016", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Northampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The support provided by colleagues and management enhanced the quality of the working experience.
