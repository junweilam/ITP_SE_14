You are usually signed up to \"Regular Shifts\" which means that the company can get rid of you or take away your hours without any reason/notice but if you wan't to take a day off as your contract states you can with 48 hours notice the management will tell you that you can't do this unless you find cover you have to come into work.

Management from the CEO down is a complete farce. \r\n\r\nIneffectual layers of management upon management make GLL a micro-managed mess. GLL inflicts a one-policy-fits-all procedure upon all its' leisure centres taking no operational specifics of any one leisure centre into account. This usually leads to a trail of chaos wherever they go. For instance GLL \"dont do part-time contracts\" which presents a lot of indirect sex discrimination and leads to leisure centres desperate for staff at weekends.  From the cheap ASDA-esque branding (including the poorly constructed uniform) to the horribly violated health and safety policies and procedures this company doesn't know how to look after itself let alone its employees. \r\n\r\nHealth and Safety doesn't seem to be an issue for GLL. At one point a very busy pool presenting zero chlorine content in the water was far less important than ensuring all staff were wearing their name badges (which carry first and surnames  - surely a safeguarding and privacy issue in the year 2015?) Lifeguards were left guarding inadequately lit pools, or for periods of nearly 3 hours. \r\n\r\nNo two members of regional management have the same information as each other and none of them seem to be able to convey important information to operational staff. Legend, The computer system used for bookings and cash register operation is an embarrassment and even Fischer Price would be ashamed of it as a childrens toy. One would assume the ego of the head office cretin who pitched the system to management is being protected by keeping it rather than admitting defeat and putting an actually usable system in place. This system gives reception staff regular cause to apologise to customers (who rather helpfully, have come to understand its inadequacies and are most sympathetic)  \r\n\r\nI could go on but even the internet itself has limited storage space and I wouldn't want to take it all up with this.

No guidance and assistance in claiming statutory sick pay.  \r\n-Poor communication from management and head office.\r\n- Savings and profit are prioritised over safety and  quality of service.\r\n\r\n-There is no interest in quality of teaching. Some teachers, though qualified, can barely swim and have very little interest in swimming. Yet casual teaching work is often offered on a first come first served basis, rather than ability or performance of the teacher.\r\n\r\n- The timesheet payroll system doesn't work properly and many staff are not paid correctly or on time.\r\n \r\nTeachers are only paid contact time.\r\n\r\nThey are however, expected to perform additional unpaid work. \r\nFor example:\r\n1) setting up and putting away teaching equipment.\r\n2) setting up lane ropes\r\n3) picking up, returning,  synchronising and charging devices used for taking register and assessment. \r\n4) Finding and organising cover if they are ill or unable to attend work . Some managers even distribute notices claiming: \"It is not the managers responsibility to find cover\".\r\n\r\n5) Changing into and out of work wear*\r\n\r\n*Teachers are expected to teach in the water, yet they are not paid for the time to get changed or have a shower. Showering before and after swimming is necessary to keep the pool clean and wash away the chlorine which is toxic.    \r\n\r\nNB. Interestingly, in  monthly pool training session (first aid/lifeguarding) which is compulsory for lifeguards and centre management, at least 20-30 minutes of the two hour session is  given to  getting changed and showered. They are still paid for the whole two hours of training.  Swim teachers are not paid to get changed or shower however.\r\n\r\nTeachers are not paid or provided expenses to travel between teaching jobs at different centres either. So a teaching day might consist  of one hour at one centre followed by two hours at another centre and four hours at yet another centre, Teachers are only paid for contact time however.
