Then you are told the signature is not sufficient and the paperwork is sent for another evaluation which will take take several weeks. The attitude is semi-rude and the comments are bewildering - each side says different things. The whole way of doing this safety evaluation suggests that the idea of doing something new is irrelevant and invasive. After idle attempts for three-four months, you realize the true state of things, give up and try to make up on the wasted time with some in-hand methods. No collaboration. No potentially exciting project.\r\n\r\n- IT support is more of an obstacle\r\nExamples: \r\n  you arrive to a workshop and discover that, despite a proper early notice, IT did not manage to install the required software. You can not install it yourself as the computers are locked for new installations.\r\n   \r\n  IT will not help you with any problem related to your privet computer even if the software required for your research runs on PC only and you use your own computer to run this software. They do not support PCs in general. No discrimination here, just a rule.\r\n\r\n  In general, what matters here is your personal relationship with the IT guys. If you are lucky to be pretty young female - you may get the password required  to install any software of your machine. If you are just another research stuff, male, no blond - you may wait for a month (no exaggeration here!) for your software to be installed. \r\nBesides this, UoW is short on the number of I-net plugs. So you get a table and then are told that there is no I-net port available and you have to wait until somebody will leave and inherit you his/her port. \r\n\r\n- Working place: There is NO respect for the \"thinking\" part of research - you are placed in a walk-through room with 20 other people, with no privacy whatsoever, no proper ventilation, slamming doors and poor lightening and are expected to find it a productive environment.\r\nThe office furniture is from 80s - 3 chairs I have tried were all broken. Not enough power points = we have chains of extensions running under our tables.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, money is invested in all the open spaces e.g. cafeteria, halls etc. People are of a less value that the look of this place.\r\n\r\nRecently they removed kitchenettes and installed water coolers. But nor kettles, no hot water. A glass of hot water in cafeteria is 50p.\r\n\r\nWCs... you must manage flushing only once! co'z after you flush - it takes 6-7 mins to get the water tank refilled. The results = restrooms are rarely clean in afternoons.\r\n\r\nRecycling bins have recently been installed and you get an email that trash bins in offices will be emptied once a week to \"encourage\" you to recycle. By the end of week, all the organics that can not be recycled and are dumped in the office bins stink. I am afraid to this what will happen in summer.\r\n\r\nBottom line - very much in UoW is invested to make up the place as cool and nice and great. Unfortunately, after some time you discover that it's a very provincial University that tries to grab as many students as possible without investing neither in its people nor in its research facilities. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a PhD or a post training - I would suggest skipping this Uni, unless there is no better place to go."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Teaching Fellow at the Economics Department", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Teaching Fellow in Coventry, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great work/life balance.
