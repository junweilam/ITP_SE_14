There is a lot of inconsistency between roles, you could be a manager of a 10 person team, with twice the workload of a person managing a 3 person team but you get paid the same. Staff turnover is high and there are constantly gaps in teams, there is no contingency plan for resource gaps which creates bad feeling within teams and falls back on to you as a middle manager. The systems are very outdated and a lot of data entry work is done manually, this creates a lot of pressure especially at busy times in the academic calendar.
