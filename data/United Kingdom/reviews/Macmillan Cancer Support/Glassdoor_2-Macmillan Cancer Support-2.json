The amount of knowledge and personalities lost have been staggering. However, the directors and senior management kept insisting that millions of \u00a3 will be invested in the department. The mother of all lies that was! If you are an IT professional who is eager to learn new skills or wanting to progress in your career, then avoid this place like the coronavirus.

Although I then passed this on to another member of staff of slightly more senior position and this person agreeing with me, I got manipulated and harassed by my line manager. This person would from then on constantly bully me. When I brought this up to senior management, they sided all together and tried to intimidate me with their horrible mind-games. On my request for reasonable adjustments, I was not provided any of that - even though there were clearly resources available and this is being imposed by the government by several legal/ public Acts. Thy simply wanted me out and continued to bully and manipulate me; knowing that I was not coping well anymore and got extremely stressed because of their actions. - Most of the staff of many years left due to the bullying culture and severe control patterns/ micromanagement and since the 're-structuring' process it got even worse. \r\n\r\nInitially they appeared friendly and welcoming, only to turn the table without warning and pounce on you. \r\n\r\nI became very ill, which my doctor confirmed was the effect the dysfunctional dynamic of this workplace had on me. - Never before did this happen to me.
