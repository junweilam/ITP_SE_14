In the early stages of my work, when things were new, I had consistent supervision and guidance which was incredibly helpful. When I first started, I received monthly supervision meetings with my manager, which were incredibly helpful (to say the least!). These meetings gradually taper off as you gain more experience, but supervision sessions are extremely useful and you can always call in or email for further help with specific cases. \n\nAs a volunteer I meet monthly with other volunteers and guest speakers (virtually due to COVID - in usual times I understand that these sessions would take place in person). I really enjoy speaking to and supporting clients, and VS is a very supportive and fulfilling workplace. VS also offers free private counselling for all volunteers (which I have not used, but can appreciate is a very good workplace benefit). \n\nThe time I have spent working for VS has been during the pandemic. Although I have not yet physically met any staff members at VS Leeds, I have really felt a sense of community within the workplace. I also like that the position is flexible - when I first started I was unsure what 'flexibility' would encompass. I receive clients suitable to me - my clients match my remit/level of training. I choose my own shifts, I stick to them, there are no set deadlines for work (so long as I call clients at our arranged time). I also quite like that support takes place over the phone and I can work from home, at least for now, though home visits would be good too. I like that I have received a volunteer phone too for texting. This position has given me a great sense of fulfilment and I am proud to work for Victim Support.", "cons": "For prospective applicants, I will say that the interview process is (justifiably) difficult and does require 'revision',, like you would in secondary school for an exam. It is a long process with intensive training and you really do have to remember everything (and take notes!) to receive/pass your accreditation. It is also nerve wracking to have your manager listening in and taking notes on your first session with a victim - but it really is ultimately very helpful for feedback and self-improvement. The training is also quite intense but is very useful, and you have to keep a mental note of all that you learn... it will help when you begin solo support.\n\nAnother 'con' might be that you don't know what you're going to get - it may be an ASB case, a fraud/forgery or a GBH assault, and you need to recall specific training and know how to tailor support to the individual on the spot. Thankfully there is a huge amount of crime-specific guidance on Surf, honestly I couldn't have coped without it at the start. Importantly, the final interview questions are HARD and you will need to remember everything from training, in detail, and apply it to your work.\n\nVolunteering for VS has also occasionally made me feel a failure. When I cannot fully guide the victim towards their preferred outcome; if they make a formal complaint about my support; if they show little improvement across support, it can feel personally discouraging. It's part of the job - impartiality is crucial, but sometimes that can be difficult. Whilst the job is flexible and very volunteer-oriented, it can be taxing. You grow to like your clients, you enjoy speaking to them. When support is unsuccessful, that can be hard."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Brilliant mission but over stretched", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Service Delivery Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing opportunities to deliver front-line work. \nReally dedicated employees\nInteresting training and development opportunities", "cons": "Lack of team resourcing - many people are burnt out and stressed\nA lot of middle management is ill-equipped or their role\nLow salary\nRestructure occurs every 3 or so years due to funding bids, which completely chanegs ways of working and is disruptive"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Support", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "26 Mar 2022", "job_title": "Deputy Team Leader in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "My team supported me a lot on my growth.", "cons": "Senior management can get political"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Good Company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "12 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Leeds, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Gain good experience \r\nWork within small, close-knit team", "cons": "Often understaffed \r\nHigh workload\r\nDemanding roles"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "APPLY APPLY APPLY", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "8 Feb 2022", "job_title": "Team Leader in Cardiff, Wales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fantastic supportive team\r\nDifferent every day", "cons": "24 hour rota which can be tough"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Alright for a short while", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "21 Jan 2022", "job_title": "ISVA in Barrow in Furness, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Interesting work and training opportunities", "cons": "Has a Poor salary for workload"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "My experience", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "24 Apr 2021", "job_title": "Independent Victims Advocate in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I feel honoured to have work with a group of people who are supportive, friendly, dedicated and caring.
