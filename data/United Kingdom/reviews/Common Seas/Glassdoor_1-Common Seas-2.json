The team meetings are to be endured, and the ever-decreasing members of staff all share the same misgivings."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Culture issues = high staff turnover", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Oct 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Positive mission and nice colleagues.", "cons": "Has an extreme culture of micro-management.
