There are zero development opportunities and correct salaries are only paid to employees who are liked by HR and the CEO.

These have been filled with people from their immediate circle. There is a lack of transparency in how these positions have been created and also how these people have been recruited. The majority of these new individuals that have joined have been placed on high salaries with many existing staff being told that they could not offer them a pay rise.\r\nIf you are not part of the immediate circle that has been referred to above, you will find it increasingly difficult to progress. \r\nThere are individuals within the Senior Management structure who I would not classify as, \u201cfit and proper\u201d for their role. If you look in detail at their experience, you will note that some have no background in the roles that they find themselves in. Hence; there is a lack of competency.  \r\nThere have also been instances of unethical generation of funds with projects failing to be implemented. For a charity that proclaims to follow the teachings of Islam; I find this both questionable and deplorable. There was an instance where by funds raised remained dormant in an account for a significant period of time with no project implementation, yet when another crisis struck in the same region; management pushed for more funds to be generated. \r\nThe fraternity at Muslim Aid are all about generating noise. To this end, if you carry out searches on the internet, you will see that they have gone about this objective by seeking media attention. There is an agenda to propel certain individuals at the Charity in the media. Conduct your own searches and you will see it\u2019s the same faces. As mentioned it\u2019s about being in front of the camera and for these individuals to tell a story and simultaneously generate interest in Muslim Aid. The idea is to depict the notion that Muslim Aid is responding/doing work, in most cases there is a lack of substance. As mentioned above this view is further enhanced by the fact that they do not report back to their donors. Their donors only ever receive vague feedback in the lead up to campaign times. Furthermore, the website does not provide you with enough information about what they are doing/ what they have done with funds/ implementation of projects. This in my view reduces any credibility the Charity has.\r\nThere is also a lack of competency within the HR department with extremely poor record keeping being prevalent.   \r\nA word of advice to any potential candidate(s) seeking employment with Muslim Aid, if you are using the opportunity of employment as a stepping stone in your career then it is worth it. If you are looking to develop a career long term within Muslim Aid, you would be hard pushed to find opportunities here.\r\nIt is a highly unprofessional environment with underhand tactics deployed by management. I witnessed first hand how a number of ex-colleagues were managed out which I found extremely distasteful. They proclaim to serve humanity, but they have little to no compassion for staff members."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great organisation to work for!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "- Fantastic culture in the teams I am working with. \r\n- Wonderful cause and feel like I\u2019m making a difference\r\n- Brilliant people\r\n- Great opportunities to develop", "cons": "Shortage of volunteers at times"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Lots of flexibility", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "1 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Very flexible employer, given space to work independently and use initiative.", "cons": "Lack of direction,  no clear vision"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Best intentions but slightly chaotic management", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "8 Mar 2016", "job_title": " in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "People are polite and considerate\r\nThe work is meaningful and valuable", "cons": "Program implementation/humanitarian response often gets bogged down in bureaucracy"}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Average", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "14 Nov 2019", "job_title": "Officer in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Culture\r\nFlexi working \r\nFriendly environment \r\nApproachable senior staff (sme)", "cons": "Staff Morale Is low \r\nLack of progression\r\nNo training opportunities"}]]
