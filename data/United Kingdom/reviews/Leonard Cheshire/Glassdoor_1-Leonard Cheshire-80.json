Dangerous work practices including no manual handling or risk assessments shown to staff new or agency before using equipment for transfer and broken equipment information not handed over to next shift and untested eqipment told to be used by nurse leads to carers equipment that is not suitable for bariatic patients who weigh over the maximum load.
