Everyone I know that is a MB graduate would HIGHLY recommend it and have no regrets about their decision to go.\r\n\r\nAdvice: When considering the program, the value shouldn't be about how much you'd be paid monthly or the cost of the program because it's an investment into yourself and the value you'll be after you have this experience. Life is about taking risks, and this is one you definitely want to take (actually I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d consider it a risk considering I am SO happy with my decision to go and would consider it the best year of my life so far)", "cons": "Since you don\u2019t get paid much (granted you also don\u2019t have to pay for housing- which would be a lot based on the excellent location we had) \u2013 you will probably find your income the most frustrating thing about the program. Luckily, everyone else is also in the same boat, and everyone makes it work in their own way. \r\n\r\nEveryone has their own vices and willingness to give things up (i.e. I brought one suitcase compared to 2; I barely bought new clothes, etc)... You just need to go into it knowing you won\u2019t be making the average salary but the experience is worth EVERY penny (and every penny you don\u2019t make!).\r\n\r\nI travelled to 12 countries while I was there, so giving up the coffee before work or eating ramen for a month was SO worth it for each trip \r\n\r\nYour teams are also extremely understanding of your situation (want to travel/also broke during HH)\r\n\r\nThe only other thing that some people found challenging was living with roommates from other countries (you get to pick your roommates halfway through the program). I was usually never home (working, classes, travelling, etc) so I didn\u2019t find this as challenging as others."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Reward Specialist in Investment Bank", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "27 Feb 2017", "job_title": "International Projects Director in Blackpool, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It is a very good opportunity for me to change my career from Social Science background to business background.
