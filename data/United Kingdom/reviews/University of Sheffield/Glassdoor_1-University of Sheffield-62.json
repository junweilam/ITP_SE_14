The actual salaries are often less competitive when comparing to other technical or STEM roles.\r\n\r\nEvening and weekend work seemed common, even though it usually wasn't rewarded - particularly as certain grades of staff had a note in their contract regarding their responsibilities towards completing a project and their limitations for paid overtime or working extra hours to meet deadlines. This isn't an issue in my opinion, but it does grow old quickly when the bonus or renumeration structure does little to highlight or reward this dedication (salary type bonuses were completely non-existent in my experience).\r\n\r\nOpportunities for CPD and training can sometimes be missed if a particular project is deemed urgent. This makes sense from the organisation's perspective but is perhaps unfair on the employee who would value such training."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Overall, a good workplace", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2023", "job_title": "English Language Tutor in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "-Supportive working atmosphere -Flexible hours", "cons": "-Minimal professional development time. -Number of students is constantly increasing."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "18 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Postdoctoral Research Associate in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working hours Remote working opportunity Lots of seminars Opportunity to work with renowned scholars", "cons": "In city campus May not have personal room for research"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Very good", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "6 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Working Student in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Genuinely kind and caring, learn many things.", "cons": "Large workload, not all computers are good."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "A decent place to do a PhD with the right supervisor", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Feb 2023", "job_title": "PhD Student in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fellow PhD students are very friendly and collaborate.", "cons": "University administrative staff are of very little support to students."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "-", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "7 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Admin Officer in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good money Good employee benefits", "cons": "Bullying culture Blame culture Old systems"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Former lecturer", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Mar 2023", "job_title": "Lecturer in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It has a Friendly environment", "cons": "It has very Poor management"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good company", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "7 Feb 2023", "job_title": "Queue Manager in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "friendly staff who are willing to help at any given time.", "cons": "none was a very nice place to work"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Working as a researcher at the University of Sheffield", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "16 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Post Doctoral Research Associate in Sheffield, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "I personally did not have good experience working at this University.", "cons": "It is not really an international university.
