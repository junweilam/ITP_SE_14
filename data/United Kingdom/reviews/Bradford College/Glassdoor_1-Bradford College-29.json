I can comfortably say working at Bradford College has been the worst experience of my career. The college as a whole is a toxic environment, allowing a culture of bullying to thrive amongst staff, making it an unbearable place to work. Very few staff members actually care about the students, and instead focus their energy on complaining, putting down other members of staff and refusing to take accountability for their work. The consistent restructuring creates a sense of uncertainty, and leaves behind a chaos of confusion. The \u201clow level staff\u201d (as we have been referred to as) are left to feel overworked, underpaid and undervalued. Personally, having worked here for just over two years and experiencing three restructures/redundancies within my department, I found it extremely difficult to maintain motivation and a positive attitude towards my work. Management do not take the time to understand you and your role and neglect to support your work. Professional development opportunities are very limited and of poor quality, and there is little opportunity for progression in an institute like this. Not only have I felt unsupported in my work, but also as an employee with a disability, I spent my first few months here chasing HR for support in working with a disability, help with making reasonable adjustments and occupational health support. After being consistently ignored I had no choice but to give up. This was extremely disappointing and unacceptable. The list of negatives is extensive and personally, I don\u2019t see Bradford College improving and would never return to such an awful place of work."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Bradford college", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Service Desk Analyst in Bradford, Yorkshire and the Humber, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good working environment for staff", "cons": "Pay isn't the best here."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Inspirational place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "28 Jan 2022", "job_title": "Project Manager in Bradford, Yorkshire and the Humber, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The staff are dedicated and care deeply about their students, which makes the college a lovely place to work.
