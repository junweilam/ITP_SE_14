The senior HR team rule with fear and so are never challenged on decisions, idea's, practices or management style. Growth, in HR the gaps between roles are so large you'll never progress unless your personally liked, regardless of skills, abilities or merits, furthermore, they do not invest in their own, they will happily recruit externally when there is enough talent internally to fill a position. If you raise a discrimination claim, either be ready to be told 'we will look into it', or be suspended and investigated for how you raise the claim! Additionally, with working in HR, the way managers within HR would manage their teams and staff was disgusting, I can't imagine how the rest of the organisation is behaving, if not even HR can manage in an ethical manner. In terms of the role, the amount of work is completely disproportionate to the amount of hours / your salary and banding you are paid, you are expected to get work done regardless if that means staying until 8pm at night, or working at the weekends, when you challenge this, like I did - you get the response of ''you need to get the work completed''. \r\n\r\nA colleague told me something that will stick with me for life, they said that they were told by a member of staff that it was a Master / Slave relationship. In terms of Equality and Diversity, you can count the amount of BME Managers on two hands, and on one hand those that are Senior Managers, doesn't that say it all?"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Overall a good experience", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "6 Oct 2020", "job_title": "Healthcare Assistant in Northampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Excellent floor staff, great team environment\r\nGood duty pay for weekends and evenings\r\nExtremely flexible working patterns, good for self-employed, students and those with a second job", "cons": "No danger pay\r\nCan be very high stress\r\nStaffing rotas are sometimes not well thought out\r\nNot many other benefits\r\nStaff turnover is quite high\r\nLow ceiling for advancement"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "as a bank healthcare assistant you get to work in many different wards and gain very different experiences .", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Sept 2017", "job_title": "Healthcare Assistant in Northam, South West England, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "gain many different experiences around the whole organisation.There is a lot of opportunities to work your way up.", "cons": "working on the bank you get really badly treated in different wards and you sometimes don't feel like a team member as some ward staffs can treat you very bad."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Worst employment experience of my life", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Feb 2018", "job_title": "Manager in Northampton, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice grounds, patients and staff are motivated a motivated for the sake of the vulnerable patients.", "cons": "Bullying is rife, it seems fully acceptable to shout at staff for being unwell. \r\nThe business was not able too support or provide reasonable adjustments for long term disability, which had been supported by other employers, response was eye rolling, huffing and either walking off or blaming me for being in significant pain caused due to their failures to provide simple adjustments. \r\nThe strategic approach is flimsy, decisions for multi million pound changes are made on rhetoric and who shouts the loudest/is the biggest personality, rather than reviewing and assessing options using sound evaluation of risk, opportunities and threats.
