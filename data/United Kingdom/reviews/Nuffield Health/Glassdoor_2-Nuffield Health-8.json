back bone got left behind.\r\n- Managers rude to members in person and behind their backs\r\n- Managers rude and overly open about views of other employees in the club \r\n- Very corrupt from all

All this whilst other clubs in the area are getting new equipment and refurbishment.\r\n\r\nWas in a management team where if you did the bare minimum you were left alone, if you did extra there was bland platitudes of thanks but then your workload would increase or you'd be expected to do it everytime. It was less about performance and more about who could you blame for the failures instead and what \"buzz\" words you could mention to make you look better in conference calls. \r\n\r\nMy GM was very quick to discipline some staff and not others for reasons that are very trivial at times.\r\n\r\nDistinct lack of budget for training staff which leaves teams woefully unprepared for situations and can lead to sometimes dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nInternal academy training is a joke and needs hugely reworking as some of the mandatory units are pointless for a lot of staff - lifeguards and cleaners do not need to complete IT governance training at all is just one example. Having \"Nuffield\" courses instead of paying for industry-recognised qualifications is also ratehr dangerous way to as this opens the company up to all sorts of potential safety issues in the event of a future incident. Academy units are meant to be completed on the first (or as close to) week of work yet I found that almost none of the logins would work. This, again, lead to an overactive GM asking for disciplinary actions for incomplete training.\r\n\r\nSeems like upper-levels cared more about memberships sales numbers than anything else, didn't seem to care what it took and no excuse was good enough which lead to many people being mislead into taking out contracts. This also meant that the attrition rate was appalling and people cancelling in droves when they find out new members are paying less than them.\r\n\r\nGiven I had a salaried role, I was expecting that I would have been able to get on with my own work but found that my hours were dictated by how much sales daily rigour I had to in order to \"help out\" so I ended up with no time to complete my other important work. Any time worked over, I was told to \"take back\" but it was never when it would be beneficial to me but rather when it was of no use. With constant cuts to staffing being asked for from above, more work was being done by less people.\r\n\r\nRegularly worked over my allotted hours, week in week out, only to be told that I could use any owed time to deal with an urgent family matter.\r\n\r\nWork life balance was awful towards the end.\r\n\r\nNever got commission once - the structure is unrealistic and does not promote people to achieve to gain more commission but more out of fear of being disciplined. You can have hit your sales target (even over-achieve) and get nothing before someone defaults on their first DD payment and don't pay within a small window. SO you've done the hard work, got them to sign and sorted everything only for them to not be paid right, go into arrears and not be able to pay until their wage is sorted.\r\n\r\nI can't speak to other clubs, but it felt like my GM was out of their depth and either not getting the support or couldn't handle the pressure."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bad management, \u201cstaff are temporary\u201d attitude", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "14 Nov 2018", "job_title": "Front of House in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Free gym membership,  friendly environment, lovely members, some flexibility in shifts.

Nuffield prides itself as a non-for profit but through my 3 years of working there I saw many times customer service and patient care compromised in the sake of profits. \r\n\r\nI would regularly see patients who would have been send to me to have inappropriate tests and assessments which the bookings and referrals team would tell them they need. Sadly after the hefty bill for services the patients still don't have the answers they need. \r\n\r\nAdditionally Nuffield uses their staff like profit machines, and in my 3 years I saw many good staff members come and go, as they were poorly treated and over worked to see as many patients as possible. \r\n\r\nAs a result the quality of care they gave would quickly diminish and they would end up leaving only to be replaced by new and much less experienced staff only for the cycle to repeat. \r\n\r\nEven staff members who worked in the high-end, high profit centres located in London were payed the same as centres throughout the country that saw less patients and made less money. This type of imbalance and their failure to correct it is one of the main reasons I left.  Additionally Nuffield management wouldn't let its team members in Physiology join a union, even to point that when I tried to join some they said they didn't recognise any of the unions, which was clearly intended to reduce the employee's rights.\r\n\r\nOverall I did learn a lot from Nuffield and it got me to where I am today, but it was not without it's sacrifices and a lot of pain.
