Is giving staff an extra day of holiday as a reward for getting the Top 100 Employer award appropriate? Lack of competence across all levels of management. What a waste of nurses' subs and a missed opportunity to do good. Unfortunately it's a monopoly so not much incentive to improve unless member numbers drop. A weird, sad place.

Exectives board members reading out emails they have received from staff (I'd assume were meant to be private) in order to belittle them at staff conferences is commonplace and does little to make staff feel that they are equal in their eyes. The 'Dignity Charter' doesn't seem to apply in these circumstances. Get in with the right person and promotion after promotion on the fast track system is a given. Offer up an opinion or ask questions and certain managers will ensure your RCN journey ends there.  If you are female applying for a job in one department for instance, I've heard the RCN isn't the place for you as apparantly as \"women don't belong in it\". I'll give that department a wide birth then, it obviously requires a reboot.  I wonder how our membership would feel about that sort of language in the workplace? Of course the vast majority of managers and staff are excellent, supportive and offer a wonderful service to our members.  The staff really do care and it's this that makes the RCN a bearable place to work. Talk of transparency, continued training and development, and technology being embraced in previous reviews are unfortunately just words plucked out of the air with no real foundation, scribed I presume by our HR department.  Do real people actually use that language in a proper review?  I'll let you make your mind up but to me they sound more like job adverts than reviews. Hats off to them though for joining Glass Door.  Maybe now they'll get some proper feed back."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Great employer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "11 Sept 2015", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Amazing pay and benefits\r\nReally 'nice' people to work for\r\nAspires to be a really great organisation", "cons": "Future planning could be better\r\nDecision making can take a long time (although there are processes in place to tackle this)"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good, open employer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "22 Apr 2016", "job_title": " in Chiswick, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Transparent pay structure, good flexible working policies, diversity celebrated", "cons": "Difficult to move up to a higher grade, recruitment system cumbersome"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Geat place to work first class employer supportinf its team through covid-19", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "14 May 2020", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Cardiff, Wales", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Executive Team who are committed to doing the right thing", "cons": "Nothing that would warrant noting here."}], [{"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not the place for career progression", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "4 Mar 2020", "job_title": "Senior Marketing Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary and benefits.\r\nSupporting nurses and the future of nursing.", "cons": "Poor for career progression. \r\nHigh pressure with little support."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Ok place to work", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "11 Dec 2019", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working options.
