I was really worried about asking for the time off as we were entering a really busy time at work but my manager and HR were extremely supportive. Through out my time off I received gentle check ins to see how I was doing - never once was I pushed into returning before I was ready. It is so refreshing to work somewhere that cares about their staffs well-being. \r\n\r\nMy return to work after being away for 2 weeks (which I was really nervous about) couldn\u2019t have gone better. HR ensured to check in with me and helped me prioritise what I needed to focus on.", "cons": "I can\u2019t think of a con. Any issues I have had, I have raised with HR who have dealt with it quickly."}]]
