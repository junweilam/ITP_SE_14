Still don't have a contract.\r\nCompany has had the biggest boom in profits in the past 2 years due to the pandemic and more people wishing to/needing to study from home, workload has escalated and duties increased but they do not pass on the huge profits to their hard working employees. They do not pay competitive market rates. The profit they make per staff member far surpasses the profits made per staff member of competing companies. OU is greedy. \r\nPension scheme is completely unaffordable to ordinary/lower level staff members but you have the 'choice' to be either all in or all out on it. they have proposed over \u00a3336 per month from my measly wage (that's 20%!!) part of which is set in to recover a deficit from past poor management of the pension which was in place before my employment. There has been a recent strike to keep the contribution for pensions at it's current rate....currently at \u00a3168 per month (10%) which is also not affordable at all either. OU is out of touch. We are in a crisis as it is with many staff members stressed about bills and affording heat, food, petrol already. Higher up staff with a fairer wage can afford this but most of the workforce can not, they seem to be looking after the more affluently paid staff members and their futures and not the poorer ones.\r\nThey don't practice what they bleat at all. Always talking about mental health awareness, the environment, support etc. But they do not listen to what employees need and/or want, they do not increase pay and do not support you in providing proper training or support on the job. You get a quick two word answer to a complex issue and then you are left to guess-work or trying to connect the dots on your own, you are rarely sure you have done the right thing for your student. The workload and nature of the workload is so varied and so vast, you could come across a completely new query every work day. I feel disadvantaged as i do not get robust or even rounded answers or competent training and I feel stifled to advance. You just have to blag it and hope you have done the right thing. If you can't blag it, you will not last.\r\nThe office is in an awkward location for most people to get to, it is in a more expensive area that most of the low level staff can not afford to live in and to get there on public transport from just about anywhere in Manchester, you need to go into town to go back on yourself, which results in 1.5 hrs in commute each way from pretty much anywhere. They talk of the environment but they want you to travel in, paying out for a ton of petrol or eroding your work life balance due to how long it takes to get there on public transport, 3 hrs a day gone in commuting, also they insist on mask wearing when walking about the office as Covid is still present but they seat you shoulder to shoulder with other staff members??? They also make you bring in all your electronics, laptop, pens, paper, mouse, knife, plate, cup  and personal items etc etc every day which means after work you can not be free, you need to take these valuables all the way home to safety rather than them just allow us to work from home more permanently or at least until there is a more practical work environment to attend and leave these items at. Why not have personal lockers only touched by you???

This is pretty starkly reflected in the unit's results in the staff survey, and in terms of staff turnover, with the period from mid-2014 onwards seeing a very high number of resignations at all levels of the organisational hierarchy. \r\n\r\nThere is a fundamental problem with the way that the unit is managed, and there have been examples where colleagues have been publicly - in open plan offices or large team meetings - belittled and humiliated as a means of exerting power and control; a bullying culture is rife. Any degree of autonomy seems to have been removed, with previously well-respected, responsible, accountable managers being undermined on even the simplest of decisions. There is a constant undercurrent of mistrust and it is implied that management do not have faith in the abilities and competencies of their teams, a specific example being sheep-dip training and development activities, which are patronising, and well below the level of a mostly very experienced and highly skilled staff body. There have also been comments to the effect that involvement with the trade union is generally frowned upon by management. \r\n\r\nDespite what is formally communicated to the unit staff, there is a very real threat that people will lose their jobs if they fail to hit unachievable targets for exponential growth, and there are known examples of people being performance managed out of the business when they have failed to achieve, despite having flagged these measures as being too aggressive, unachievable and unsustainable, especially in a rapidly declining marketplace; individuals are all too often made into scapegoats. The party line seems to be that targets are being met and that therefore, there is no problem however, there is seemingly little consideration for the cost in terms of impact on staff morale, sickness and turnover. The BDU and therefore, the wider OU has lost some amazing and talented individuals of late; an awful lot of skill and expertise has simply walked out of the door. \r\n\r\nThe university is first and foremost there to service students, and so is not operationally capable of delivering true Business to Business value, often doing so in spite of itself. The OU machine is huge and diverse, and as such, there is a constant political struggle between units in terms of budget, resources, objectives etc, often creating a conflict of interests, and in many cases, results in a blame culture with a lack of ownership or accountability. Despite repeated flagging of these business blockers and the everyday challenges faced by operational level staff, management has failed to act on their positions of responsibility and influence in terms of breaking down barriers to enable and facilitate achievement.  \r\n\r\nIn my personal experience, when I asked for help and support, expressing that the pressure was manifesting as stress and seriously impacting my health, and explaining that I was working an unsustainable number of hours just to scrape the bare minimum of what was required of me, my concerns were dismissed; I was reminded that \"the OU is a fantastic employer, and we get a generous amount of annual leave\", therefore, the view was that I am afforded plenty of time to relax and I should just get on with it.
