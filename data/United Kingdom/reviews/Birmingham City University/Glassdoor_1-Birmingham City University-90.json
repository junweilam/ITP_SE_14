Best to just keep your head down, not a nice feeling.\n\nNot much opportunity or encouragement to develop career within the institution, it seems like you have to go somewhere else if you want to develop your career or even get new skills."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Placement officer", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "8 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Placement Officer in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good place to work, no complaints", "cons": "Nothing much to be said regarding cons"}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Work in progress", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "25 May 2022", "job_title": "Placement Coordinator in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Welcoming team, helpful and understanding", "cons": "Unorganised, very scatty, needs major development but they are working on it"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "teaching", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "4 Jul 2022", "job_title": "Teacher in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "nice, life changing , busy life", "cons": "long hours and demandin shedules"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Good company to work for", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Administrator in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good holiday and great colleagues", "cons": "Going to the office when job could be done from home"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Excellent", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "22 Jun 2022", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible working, empathy and supportive", "cons": "Progression opportunities, routes into new roles"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Turn your industry experience into teaching success", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "12 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Visiting Lecturer in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "With the right qualifications and industry experience, the university is happy to offer you part-time teaching roles which have become available.

Clueless management with perhaps the worst communication I have ever witnessed. I feel sorry for the students, so sorry to see them suffer and not get the best experience possible. \r\n\r\nDue to a number of Vice Chancellors in quick succession, the morale is at an all time low. Several employees of this once great University are on sick leave. There is nothing organised about this place or any communication between your own team. \r\n\r\nWork can get tiring because of short breaks. There is no support from senior management. The main issue with BCU was the management and the team leaders. In my position I had a few of these to deal with as they left or were moved to another department due to conflict. No one liked upper management unless you were their golden boy/girl. Although the new VC seems to be fresh and reasonable, who wants to make changes for the better. \r\n\r\nThe pressure was pushed down to my direct managers. This was apparent by the fact that one of them would ask you to do one thing and then another would tell you off for doing that and ask you to do something else. This was constant. Basically, no matter what you do, it would be the wrong thing. They didn\u2019t communicate with each other at all. \r\n\r\nContradictions were constant. You\u2019d be told to speak to the team manager when you had a query, but if you did you\u2019d then be told not to bother them because they\u2019re busy. If you used your initiative and passed something to a fellow colleague you\u2019d be chastised for not going via the team manager first. It was impossible to win, and when you\u2019re in a busy environment it just crushes morale. They were also too focused on the wrong things. Silly small things which had no meaning. Instead of trying to improve the University or boost morale, they were more concerned about nitpicking at little things. If they didn\u2019t like you then they would make sure that you knew it. \r\n\r\nGenerally, the staff who dislike you or view you as a threat will propagate rumours and false lies around regarding certain staff to make them feel as if they were above you, when the reality is the staff are excellent and decent who do their jobs effectively. This is because they do not want you to be above them or progress within the University job or salary wise. After I had started, I began to realise that I had made a big mistake as they sold me the world during the interview process. After a certain period of time I realised the extremely high staff turnover . Every department has staff continuously leaving. Certain staff have just handed their notice in and quit, just as they have started because of the hate politics. The long hours and the apparent extra time we all have to do which happens to increase more over time will just push us away, we are already pushed to the limit. \r\n\r\nBullying management who will speak to you in a belittle manner and there are cases of victimisation which is shrugged under the carpet . The team keeps on changing as staff constantly leaving due to this it is causing current staff more work load as it takes BCU months to re hire the person or persons who have left. \r\n\r\nIT team is highly under staffed and I used to see a new different person working there every few months which was just so bizarre. As for the IT systems they were and most likely still very out dated, slow and non responsive. Systems constantly crashing, students moaning they lost their work as computers used to crash or moodle was down. Wifi was not working or disconnecting. They were really unhelpful and when wanting help I was just passed around. This was when I was able to get hold of them as I could hardly see any IT staff around. When trying to call for IT support, there was no answer and after several emails I still did not get any response. Just gave up in the end. IT management are weak and take no responsibility, they need new management and a new system.   \r\n\r\nEffectively, you will do the job duties of three people as you will have to act like your own glorified PA and TA. No pay rise and no progression will be made available and they will attempt to restrain you in current role with low pay as much as possible, unless you are their favourite as mentioned earlier. No staff development or training to improve staff. \r\n\r\nI was criticised in meetings with team managers and a dean/director for no apparent reason at all, they will call you into these unsolicited meetings with no warnings and will not inform you what the meeting is about. They will bully and incorporate fear tactics against you. Meeting was all hearsay and no concrete evidence was provided against me. After speaking to other staff members, it had happen to them, I'd known I was not the only person to have faced this. \r\n\r\nThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me though was when I applied for an internal position elsewhere in the department, something just higher than my role that I was under taking. Once the application window had closed, only another few colleagues and I had applied for it. They started after me and had less experience but were favourites as management liked them personally. I had heard nothing back at all form HR or the managers who was doing the interview. for weeks. After the job was given to someone else within the department I was told that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to waste my time\u201d because she wanted someone who would be able to jump straight into the role with little training. Had they read my CV and application she\u2019d have seen that I had years of experience doing everything that the job required and more. Instead, she already knew that she wanted the other person for the job and wasn\u2019t interested in me at all. I found out later that the person was approached before the interview to just apply and that they would get the job. This was the blinkered outlook that management at BCU have in my department. I was not about to wait even longer as I have the experience and skills for something better already. The person was always spoon fed who got the job and was treated better in any way possible. At this point, I put my CV out there, was approached by someone about a job, applied for it and got it. If BCU aren\u2019t interested in cultivating their own staff then, guess what, there are thousands of companies out there who are happy to snap them up.\r\n\r\nFor extra context, I was good at the job and would often receive positive feedback from staff and my lovely students, was always on time, etc."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "This year working at BCU I won't forget my whole life", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "28 Jun 2012", "job_title": "Operations Administrator in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good atmosphere around the office, new opportunities being provided to explore your skills in different areas of the university.\r\nGood structure and team work spirit in Student Services Operations and Finance team", "cons": "University should invest more in the City North campus, should upgrade the facilities"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "BCU must do vastly better if any chance of moving up 'league table' ladders", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "13 Jun 2020", "job_title": "Visiting Lecturer in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "\u2022\tWonderfully friendly and helpful support staff (e.g. IT, HR, library, catering, admin etc).\r\n\u2022\tAdjacent multi-story car park.\r\n\u2022\tCampus lies next to Aston University.", "cons": "\u2022\tWant to hire best possible expertise at the lowest possible rate (beware!) \u2013 e.g. professor or assistant professor grade of person given a lecturer\u2019s rate.\r\n\u2022\tPayment only for time spent lecturing \u2013 no payment for time spent with preparation, setting up or marking (can drive a \u00a337.4/hr rate down to less than minimum wage).\r\n\u2022\tNo reimbursement of expenses \u2013 e.g. travelling time and cost, car park charges.\r\n\u2022\tDumping marking responsibilities onto visiting lecturers for work set by full-time staff (grossly unethical exploitation).\r\n\u2022\tSome amateurish and professionally unqualified academic staff (even a Prof without a doctorate!) holding the belief they know better.\r\nLeadership failure\r\n\u2022\tNo departmental induction training to H&S or IT systems or how to get paid \u2013 have to sort it out yourself in your own (unpaid) time (thankfully a very helpful IT Dept).\r\n\u2022\tIgnorance (slovenly at best) by academic staff of data protection (GDPR) regulations - seemingly no training has been given through absence of effective leadership.\r\n\u2022\tPoor student discipline and motivation arising from absence of effective course leadership.\r\n\u2022\tTechnical standards taught are not applicable in the UK e.g. ASTM instead of British .Standards.\r\n\u2022\tCourse teaching not up to date with current standards of professional practice \u2013 duty of care failure?"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Case Officer", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "5 Nov 2015", "job_title": "Student Casework Officer in Birmingham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great team and great atmosphere!
