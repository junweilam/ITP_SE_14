I had to chase up HR several times to understand such a basic aspect of any employment. HR was also very a temporary thing, no true hr. Which is very strange. A Toxic Workplace Likely Has Rapid Employee Turnover, and this company has one of the highest one I've ever experienced. \r\n\r\nThere is unprofessional behavior from senior staff, particularly in my experience. As a professional often you can feel a little discriminated against due to experience, age, and particularly gender. Often experienced degrading comments, or talked down to. Often comparisons are made between you and others, which is immensely unprofessional.\r\n\r\nOften in junior positions, you can feel like a PA to your seniors made to do minuscule unrewarding tasks, simply because your \u201cBoss\u201d cannot be bothered or doesn't actually understand how to do some simple things. There is a sense of authority which is held by senior staff, which never quite sat well with me. There is no true growth in the role.\r\n\r\nKeeps you in the dark regarding a lot of important business information that can impact you as an employee. \r\n\r\nThere is no transparency between the management team and salary increase, when I joined I was told there will be a \u201creview\u201d after 6 months, regardless of how many times this was brought up by me, they aren\u2019t interested in having any reviews. Salaries are below industry standards.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult working with people who are extremely set in their ways. Collaboration is not an easy process when you are expected to do all the work around it and the seniors are just expected to get their way regarding an easier workload.\r\n\r\nMicro-management was a huge issue - expected to provide often daily updates of all tasks I had to do, and the breakdowns of them in a written format (how long exactly each task took in minutes and hours) if something takes longer due to a blocker on the item, then you are made to feel guilty, no matter what the issue is. However, not a two-way thing, only you are to provide updates, however no such updates from your \"boss\". If you ask about their schedule, or what they are doing it was taken very very defensively. When in a team you are supposed to communicate schedules, updates etc. \r\n\r\nA very toxic working environment in my team. No matter how positive you try to be, the situation is too toxic to overcome. A supposed charity has made the work environment so toxic, it's appalling. The senior employees do not receive criticism well, at all, which is ironic, because all you hear is criticism from them. \r\n\r\nDuring the initial lockdown, they favored those who went into the office. Regardless of the situation. If you didn\u2019t due to health concerns, and just by following the governmental advice you were made to feel extremely guilty and like an awful, undedicated employee. Regardless of whether your goals were achievable remotely, you were guilt-tripped if you weren't desperate about going into the office. \r\n\r\nThe company doesn\u2019t take much of an interest in the growth of its employees (there is no true \u201ctraining\u201d when you onboard either). \r\n\r\nLots of expectations from the employee to go above and beyond, without true recognition. \r\n\r\nDepending on the role, you are often expected to do overtime without truly getting your time back (most companies provide either overtime pay or the idea of taking time back, not the case here...) \r\n\r\nMessy Organisation Structure, no business continuity plan, no strategy. \r\n\r\nI blamed myself for feeling this way, but only have realised after reading the reviews wasn't just me. I wish I saw these reviews before accepting the job and jeopardizing my mental health and confidence."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Please do not ignore the reviews!", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "28 Feb 2020", "job_title": " in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The travel - depending on the team you\u2019re working with and my team members were great", "cons": "Where do I begin. \n\nI\u2019ll start off by saying again, please listen to the reviews you are reading.
