Sadly this isn\u2019t consistently the case from the top down, as you will discover when you read about my experiences in the \u2018cons\u2019 section of this review. \r\n\r\nThe supporters of CALM are an inspiration, and it's a privilege that they enable such an organisation to thrive.\r\n\r\nThe helpline (funded and promoted by CALM, but managed by a third party) is a literal life line for so many people and is run by an absolutely incredible woman supported by a team that works tirelessly to help others who often have nowhere else to turn at their lowest point. I hold everybody who does and has worked on the CALM helpline in such high regard.\r\n\r\nIf I was asked this question in my first 6 months of working at CALM I would have been waxing lyrical about what an amazing opportunity I was given to grow a department and focus on innovative and impactful projects that would make a real difference to the most vulnerable and unsupported people in society, but sadly these opportunities never realised their potential due to resources and sponsorship being removed and diverted elsewhere in the organisation without proper consultation, consideration, or cause.", "cons": "There are multiple issues with the way the organisation is structured, managed and governed, which when coupled with the personally degrading and professionally incapacitating treatment that I both witnessed others being subjected to and directly experienced myself meant I had no choice but to leave in order to maintain my mental health, sense of dignity and sense of self.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue for me was the pattern of people abruptly falling out of favour - often due to misalignment in views with, or presenting well-intentioned challenges to the leadership team - and the unfounded ostracisation that would ensue. This was driven by the CEO and certain members of the leadership team in the form of reduction or removal of team members, projects, sponsorship and support, alongside the introduction of exclusionary behaviours coupled with unfounded challenge, criticism and \u2018gaslighting\u2019 aimed at the individual who was being unofficially \u2018managed out\u2019 of their role, or the wider organisation.\r\n\r\nThese behaviors and the related practices almost felt like a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 at times and were incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling to witness, and eventually experience directly.\r\n\r\nSome members of the leadership team played a much more active role in this than others, who, in my view, remain culpable and act as enablers of this behaviour by choosing to stand back and watch these issues unfold time and time again, and doing nothing about it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, multiple members of the leadership team directly expressed their discomfort and disagreement with how I was being treated directly to me, but remained silent when I asked them to support and challenge the related behaviors and decisions.\r\n\r\nThings got to a point where I felt I had no choice but to leave the job I\u2019d once loved in an organisation that I\u2019d genuinely believed I was safe, secure, and supported in; when in fact the opposite was true. This happened amidst the backdrop of a pandemic and looming recession, and heightened my feelings of vulnerability, confusion, isolation and anxiety at what was already an incredibly difficult time.\r\n\r\nMy experience at CALM is something that I am still working through with the support of a therapist to this day. That said, walking away and taking back my dignity, power and sense of worth was the best thing I could have done, and I\u2019m feeling like myself again now that I am free from the physical, mental and emotional tolls of working in such a dysfunctional and destructive environment.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m still not sure if the practices and behaviours that I have described so far are intentional or an unintended consequence of the lack of suitable skills, knowledge, and experience that the current CEO and leadership team possess and their related inability to run the organisation in the right way, and / or the influence of the dysfunctional rose-tinted bubble that they have created for themselves but to be honest it doesn\u2019t really matter; it is wholly unacceptable whatever the cause or intent.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, some members of the leadership team are great in their individual fields, but they don't collectively possess the knowledge and experience required to run a rapidly growing and ever-evolving organisation addressing such a complex issue.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, the rapid growth of CALM coupled with the lack of suitable leadership, governance and poor and sometimes impulsive decision making meant that there were a number of long-standing issues with the organisational structure, strategies, systems, policies and processes that contributed to an unstable, insecure, stressful and often conflicted working environment.\r\n\r\nThese issues, although acknowledged, were not properly impact assessed or addressed, and the insufficient improvement initiatives relating to these matters landed ineffectively and were often deprioritised in favour of \u2018shiny new things\u2019 and quick fixes that masked or dodged the underlying issues.\r\n\r\nWhen projects were repurposed, paused, delayed or discontinued the guise of the cause was often used as a \u2018get out of jail\u2019 free card when managing difficult conversations with funders, partners and suppliers.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the insufficient and ineffective strategy and planning, the helpline is struggling to adapt to the rapid and broad expansion of its remit, and whilst they are supportive of the broad concept of helping as many people as possible and would never turn anyone in need away, they are finding it very difficult to maintain the level of service they have become known for due to the poorly thought through yet hastily implemented decisions that have been made to position the helpline as being \u2018everything to everyone\u2019, rather than keeping it focused on its core purpose of suicide prevention to those in greatest need.\r\n\r\nAs other reviews have mentioned, proper mental health support for CALM staff and understanding of the related risks and issues is truly lacking, which is a real concern.\r\n\r\nOn multiple occasions I highlighted my concerns that CALM lacked the appropriate risk assessments, supervision and support mechanisms for (a) people at risk of vicarious trauma due to the nature of the work undertaken and the information they are exposed to, and (b) people who have been personally affected by the issue, and my concerns along with similar issues raised by many other colleagues were routinely dismissed by the CEO and leadership team.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I received no proper check in or support during or following a short period of \u2018holiday\u2019 which the leadership team & CEO were well aware was actually leave required due to work related stress and burnout compounded by an incident where a very tense, abrupt and dismissive interaction with the CEO had me in tears. I know for sure that being brought to tears by the CEO was not an isolated incident; there had been 2 similar incidents that I was aware of in the weeks surrounding this event alone.\r\n\r\nMy return to work was handled very poorly, and I was publicly and aggressively shut down and told in no uncertain terms that I had no alternative when I flagged a capacity issue affecting my ability to meet a last minute deadline on my 2nd day back in the office post stress-leave. At this point, I was attempting to catch up on my workload as well as cover the duties of a colleague who was also off sick with work-related stress for similar reasons to those that I have described.\r\n\r\nAlongside the other issues I have flagged, there are nepotistic aspects to the membership of the board of trustees, the selection of some partners (including for paid work) and recruitment and reward (pay & benefit) related decisions. \r\n\r\nIt is also common for serious issues including a highly disturbing incident that amounts to unfair dismissal whilst a colleague was very unwell, very poor attrition, D&I issues, staff burnout and other specific issues and grievances raised in exit interviews or via other feedback mechanisms to not be properly acknowledged, investigated or addressed, and ultimately to be \u2018swept under the carpet\u2019. It is also worth noting that the handling of these incidents and issues is inconsistent, depending on who is the alleged victim / perpetrator.\r\n\r\nDespite how I was treated towards the end of my time at CALM, I poured my remaining energy into producing a comprehensive handover in a bid to support my department, colleagues and ultimately the people who support and rely on CALM\u2019s services.\r\n\r\nThis process was managed very poorly by the CEO and leadership team, which led to undue stress and anxiety affecting both myself and the colleagues who were due to take over my significant, business critical workload.\r\n\r\nI was very open, honest and as constructive as I could be about my experiences during my exit interview, which was shared with the board of trustees as well as the CEO & COO. As far as I\u2019m aware nothing has materially changed as a result of the feedback I shared in my exit interview, and this is backed up by the accounts of ex-colleagues who remain working at CALM who have got in touch with me to share similar challenges that they are still experiencing at CALM to this day, along with the other experiences that have been shared on this site.\r\n\r\nSadly I have found out that after I left CALM the CEO has made defamatory and wholly untrue claims about me, in what I can only assume is an attempt to discredit the feedback I provided in my exit interview and / or excuse his poor decisions and inappropriate behaviours towards myself and others. I found this deeply upsetting, intrusive and profoundly inappropriate, although sadly not surprising, as I had witnessed other ex-employees being spoken about in a similar fashion."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "A total disappointment.", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The team is one of the most hardworking I've ever had the pleasure to work with.

An example of this is referenced in another glassdoor review on here - some colleagues and I were keen to have more transparency around salary brackets as it is a well known fact that employees at the same level were often paid more or less dependent on their relationship to senior management or who was able to get them in the door for an interview. Giving feedback at CALM never felt like a particularly safe thing to do if you had ambition to progress. Progression seems to be based on personal relationships rather than professional ability or performance. A fruit delivery twice a week and discounts on various health products is not a big enough commitment to your team\u2019s wellbeing when the nature of the work is directly linked to suicide. This is made worse given that a lot of the team, namely the fundraising team, are talking to vulnerable and bereaved families every single day, giving world class support and sometimes life saving signposting at the darkest points of some people\u2019s lives - something that has a huge emotional toll on individuals especially when unsupported by professional supervision or therapy. \r\n\r\nI joined CALM feeling excited to be part of an organisation that was making a real change. I left CALM feeling like my self confidence had been shot to pieces and completely disillusioned wth the organisation's mission. I felt completely let down by senior management after repeatedly reporting manipulative and damaging behaviour I experienced personally with one of my managers (a member of the senior management team). These issues were never tackled by HR or the senior management team due to the nepotistic relationships they have with each other and the trustee board. This is something that holds CALM back from reaching it\u2019s true potential as I am aware that various other members of the team reported the same issues, to no effect. \r\n\r\nThe senior management team likes to think that it\u2019s running a progressive organisation but the internal reality is far from it. Outwardly, the campaign\u2019s messaging is strong, fun and engaging and is put together by a communication and marketing team that works tirelessly (often leading to staff burnout). The internal culture is a world away from the shiny exterior and growing celebrity endorsements - a reluctance to tackle difficult issues is perpetuating issues of inequality in the team. I worked there for more than a year and experienced various sexist remarks, patronising treatment of junior members of staff and an extremely poor \u2018tick-box\u2019 handling of a diversity and inclusion exercise spurred on by the BLM protests of 2020."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great place to work", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "25 Nov 2020", "job_title": "Senior Manager in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Fun and supportive team, friendly and hard working", "cons": "Emotive content, can be difficult"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "One of the best companies I've worked for.
