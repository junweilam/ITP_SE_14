This is not me moaning but my experience of 3 years at HCA UK IT Department.\r\n\r\nIn terms of workforce, there are approx. 150 positions in IT, when I left in October 2021, there were approx. 80 vacant positions, leaving the workforce little time or resource to implement mid to long-term strategy, instead always focussed on keeping the lights on. Speaking with ex-colleagues this is still the case in May 2022. \r\n\r\nThe IT Department has been through 3 restructures in 4 years. Meaning long-term strategy is very difficult to implement\r\n\r\nLittle to no documentation across any of legacy development. High turnover of staff meant that a lot of time was spent untangling a complex web of code left behind by predecessors.\r\n\r\nOur data team reported to Head of Infrastructure, who didn't have the foggiest idea of what we did as a team and so did not understand our long term strategy. Focus is instead of keeping costs to a minimum. \r\n\r\nThere is a clique mentality whereby certain \"favoured\" teams and persons within the company are given preferential treatment. \r\n\r\nDuring COVID there was a recruitment freeze and understaffed teams were essentially told to put up and shut up with no regard to the health and wellbeing of their colleagues. I personally suffered with mental health during lockdown as our team was slashed from 9 people to 4, there was little support from upper management regardless of how often the issue was raised. \r\n\r\nI personally was told to \"either work more efficiently or take on less work\" by management. This was impossible as I was solely focussed on supporting existing developments, this eventually led me to be signed off for 5 weeks work due to stress. When I returned there was little support or acknowledgement from senior managers.\r\n\r\nA toxic environment where persons with long standing tenures will make every change you try to implement as difficult as possible. Change Approval Boards and Architectural Review Boards are there so that these people can flex their \"power\" and to belittle others. One incident stands out whereby a longstanding and very knowledgeable contractor was literally laughed at during one of these meetings.\r\n\r\nHR Department were cut-throat. the birth of my first child came early and occurred 4 days prior to me completing my probation period. I only found out when my paycheck was 50% less than expected for the month that the time I had taken off considered unapproved leave. After raising the issue with senior management I was simply told this was company policy. \r\n\r\nPayroll did not pay my taxes correctly so after leaving HMRC sent me an unexpected bill for unpaid taxes. \r\n\r\nSenior management team do not readily engage with rest of IT. Skip level meetings are there but were regularly cancelled and not deemed important (not just mine, but people in other teams as well)."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Never a dull moment!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "26 Apr 2022", "job_title": "Director of Digital in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great employee culture with a strong work life balance.\r\nHugely fulfilling role following the company mission of improving human life\r\nGreat opportunities for personal growth within the business\r\nStrong compensation package", "cons": "As with many larger corporates the pace of change is slow\r\nIT infrastructure needs work but progress is being made."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Excellent company", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 May 2022", "job_title": "Dpam in Wilmslow, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The company value employees and constantly looking at ways to improve and provide employees with the excellent benefits.

When it comes down to it we are all just a number.  For instance the senior manager in our central laboratories retired earlier this year after over 30 years of exemplary service, but received no retirement party or leaving present or even an announcement in praise and recognition of his contribution.  Most of us did not know he had left until some time later.  The lab has many outside customers, many of whom commented badly about the way the company had treated him.  Many staff also were left disillusioned.  The company pays poor salaries, but boasts that these are good.  They have a grading system, but very few people seem to be told which scale they are on, and the scales certainly are not available to view.  Because of this there is a high turnover of staff (the highest turnover is apparently in the H/R department itself) and this makes it very difficult for managers who have to constantly train new staff."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "London Bridge Hospital", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "15 Apr 2016", "job_title": "Staff Development Sister in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "the benefits are good.
