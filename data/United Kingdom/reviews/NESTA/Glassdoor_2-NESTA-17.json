The ones saying that the organisation has changed are right. Having been there for nearly 4 years i can tell you that the organisation has changed dramatically and not for the better. As someone who worked in the third sector before and is of a centre-left political leaning i thought i would fit in. But the new CEO (NOT Geoff Mulgan by the way, he was great) has brought his own political agenda as well as his own staff. He pushed through a big and unnecessary restructuring which saw lots of really talented people leave just so that he could pursue his own agenda (we spent almost a year on an internal strategy consultation which strangely enough ended up with the pet topics which he had suggested the month he arrived). Some other reviews have called him 'woke'. I hesitate to use that term but he is the type who talks constantly about privilege and is not interested in any framing of any problem which does not start from that position. He has divided the staff rather than unifying them (maybe that is a deliberate tactic to make it harder for staff to protest redundancies?) Some staff of a similar political persuasion have been posting five star reviews here to support him. But it is not a happy environment for many of us at the moment and like many people i dont know how much longer i will stay here.
