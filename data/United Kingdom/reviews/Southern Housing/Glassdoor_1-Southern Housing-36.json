Feels like a dictatorship, being told how to speak, which words we can and \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 use. We are not robots, we are individuals that truly care about our residents so why not value us as individuals and allow us to communicate in our own style instead of worrying about language. Lack of clarity on job roles and responsibilities across directorates makes it challenging to gather information in a timely manner, this is preventing us from delivering excellent customer services. We are not able to give clear response times and are certainly not setting realistic expectations at the first point in contact. Repairs services are terrible and this reflects badly on Southern Housing and the employees trying so desperately to help residents. We need direction, too many colleagues are confused about who is responsible for what, this is frustrating for colleagues responding to residents and nobody is held accountable for not responding to residents or their complaints. Culture needs a lot of work. Insensitive director who shows no empathy for those colleagues being relocated from Spire Court."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Ok", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "15 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Administrative Assistant in London, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Home work balance is good", "cons": "Pay is not great could be better"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Great People", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "14 Jun 2023", "job_title": "IT Security Manager in Horsham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great People, personal development opportunities", "cons": "Constant departmental changes/reviews affecting job security"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Fairly awful handling of merger", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "19 May 2023", "job_title": "Manager in Farringdon, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "before merger SHG was good place and decent people", "cons": "unbalanced merge - former senior SHG staff reporting to junior Optivo staff, first order of business following merger was to decimate the redundancy offer before a massive restructure. an awful awful environment to work in"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 4, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Exciting times ahead", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "22 May 2023", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Croydon, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "There is a strong desire to deliver an amazing customer service Exec team are supportive and will step in to help", "cons": "Newly merged and so will take some time to settle down - in a period of change"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Disorganized bunch", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "4 Jun 2023", "job_title": "Manager in Horsham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nice staff work there but management poor", "cons": "Not very clear guidance from the top and somewhat self serving"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Ok", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "25 May 2023", "job_title": "Project Manager in Horsham, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Local, good project exposure.
