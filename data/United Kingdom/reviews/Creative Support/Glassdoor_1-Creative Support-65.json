In my time, I witnessed service users being institutionally neglected and left to live in squalid conditions, with no outlook or action plan set in place for how to support them or improve their places in life. Nor were they encouraged to practice their own self care, whether that be to eat healthy meals, practice  hygiene or seek emotional wellbeing.  Their needs simply were not met, and it was shocking to witness this.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, working conditions were vile. With none or their needs being met, the service users would regularly display challenging behaviours and lash out at staff, turning the workplace into a high-anxiety and miserable place. And on top of that, a culture of blame and fear existed as a result of managers and team leaders holding staff accountable whenever incidents (such as service users becoming agitated) would happen,  or would play down concerns raised about the wellbeing of our clients. Their needs are willfully disregarded and in all my time I worked there, nothing improved. At all. \r\n\r\nAs a company and an employer, they were terrible. Wages were routinely late and often incorrect, and when HR were contacted they would dismiss the issues and there would be a long wait for backpay. I'd like to point out that this wasn't just one instance, nor was it one employee; this happened to every member of staff in Leicester the week before Christmas, and nobody had an explanation as to why.  Simply unacceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd on top of all this, the emotional weight of this job is unbearable. Working conditions were already so unpleasant, they were only made worse when simple issues like fixing a light were ignored, so the place was plunged into darkness for several weeks. The shifts require you to sleep over in cold and uncomfortable conditions, the rotas rarely allow you to plan social occasions so you will ultimately miss everything else happening in your life outside of work. And with the wages being so low already, the emotional toll is no longer worth it. For an organisation with the word \"support\" in their name, Creative Support will do the exact opposite of look after their staff. You will be dismissed, ignored and disempowered, and your wellbeing will be irrelevant. For instance, a coworker of mine was severely physically assaulted by a service user and was signed off work. The response of our manager? \"They knew what they signed up for when they took the job\". This is the attitudes presented by this group of people. Nor was I offered any support when a similar thing happened to me. Even after incident  reports are filed away and management made aware, you'll be safe in the knowledge that the same thing will be happening same time next week. \r\n\r\nIn my time working for them, my mental health took a severe impact and I find myself in a state of stunned disbelief when I look back on what I experienced. And since leaving the place, almost all of my coworkers have done the same. So if you find yourself considering taking a job with Creative Support, I ask you to remember these five words...\r\n\r\nYOU ARE BETTER THAN THIS"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "AWFUL COMPANY", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "11 Apr 2017", "job_title": "Senior Support Worker in Manchester, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Service users were lovely and most of the support workers were lovely too!

I have been 'moaned at' and made to feel I have done wrong when trying to do what I feel is best in a situation. We cannot give 'positive reinforcement' to clients if you do not give it to us.  \r\n\r\nCompany takes advantage of Support Workers who are compassionate in their role. Us who really want to help individuals have a better quality of life. Our caring nature vs company property buying tax dodge investments.\r\n\r\nWages are a joke, including 24 hour care supporting clients on holiday breaks. The Creative Support attitude is, 'you get a free holiday' and are paid only 10 hours per day. I would just like to say, it is not my holiday, I am supporting an individual with complex needs and it is very stressful working 7 days on 24 hour alert. And I do it for the client, not my own gain. I did 60 hours and 2 sleeps recently because of under staffing and was taxed heavily on earnings. Felt like crying when I saw my wage slip. \u00a36.80 is not a wage for our role, \u00a310+ is with 'danger money' added. We work Sundays, Bank holidays for no extra pay, overtime for no extra pay. If we ask for time and a half we are scolded by area management. I was accused of holding the company to ransom for trying to fill a same day shift when staff called sick and asking for time and half, as my work day became 13.5 hours with no break. It was Saturday night and my personal plans were ruined as we cannot leave project unstaffed. I was made to feel 'greedy' when my night was ruined.  \r\n\r\nUnder staffing on sleeps leaving 1 staff at risk 'lone working' on a project with a number of ill clients. I was attacked by a client with a violent history in this situation with no sorry from my company. Me and my work mates protested not to get this guy moved in but we were ignored. 3 months in, hard drugs, parties, and finally a staff member attacked. \u00a36.80 an hour for this? \r\n\r\nHaving to support clients and trying to manage office duties with no time allocated to do one or the other. \r\n\r\nLack of real training. I do not consider 1 day training good enough for me to medicate with no nurse training. I and staff are punished, suspended, and investigated for medication errors. We have common sense, but under massive pressure and under staffing we make mistakes sometimes. We are expected to find everything ourselves when updating client folders, no training at all, we are forced to sign little books, or forms saying we understand policy putting ourselves in the blame if something goes wrong. Very tactile of a corporate charity. Blame those at the bottom when we are nothing but cleaners and babysitters with nurse duties. \r\n\r\nProjects needing decoration, new beds etc, furniture. It is a mountain trying to get simple jobs done. Unless we pull the 'neglect' card, 'health and safety' card etc against our own company they will wiggle out of improving standards. I am embarrassed as a key worker of my client. His room is a bomb site and I am getting tired of fighting for better standards. \r\n\r\nTo add, they have a very small team of maintainance workers. They are all great humans but very under staffed. We can wait weeks for little and big jobs to be done. Creative Support will do anything not to use outside contractors to get a job done quicker. \r\n\r\nVal Lott needs to treat staff with respect by paying them a living wage. There really is no excuse when the company is expanding as it is. Like Rome it will collapse unless the infrastructure is of a sound foundation. At the moment it is very wobbly. Standards are dropping. I have worked in many projects as a bank relief worker. So many rules broken to get through the day by staff. They have no choice. This will only ever lead to negative incidents.  \r\n\r\nRewards are given to service users and written up in a book of propaganda called 'Creative Life'. It tells tales of amazing achievements of service users impressing suit wearing funders in the 'BIG GAME' of tick box. Staff get not even a 'thanks' for hours of being shouted at, cleaning client faeces (check stool chart), attacked, trying to budget shrinking weekly client living allowance, always acting 'positive' at work, thinking of CREATIVE ideas and spending any spare time trying to organise activity, etc, etc, etc, all of the time 'smiling' and believing we are doing something to help us into heaven. . .\r\n\r\nWAGES DEPARTMENT- they mess up your wages with no sorry then ask you wait until following Monday to have whats owed. This happens every week and I actually call them every Thursday to check because they are that bad. If you ask for same day payment they try to fob you of (it is their fault), or pay you on the day and emergency tax you. This has ruined my working day so many times. My wages are just enough to live.

You are overworked, paid a pittance and gotten rid of if they don't like you. \r\n\r\nManagement operate on a tick-box cover their backsides blame system whereby if anything goes wrong, it's all down to the frontline staff \"who've been told.\" Inductions consist of being told to read upwards of 1000 sheets of policy documents on your own with no support. Service Directors are rarely seen at individual services and often have no idea about the state of the services they are responsible for.\r\n\r\nCommunication between management and Support Workers is pretty much nonexistent. Appointments can be made for the service-users or changes to their timetables can be made without management relaying this information to staff, let alone the service-users themselves; electricians, gas technicians and district nurses turn up unannounced due to poor communication. Management don't want to know about your concerns, they're only bothered about keeping their bosses happy. If there's an audit of the service, management always miraculously catch wind of this the day or two before and run around frantically sorting things out. \r\n\r\nExpect to be put on incredibly long shifts i.e 9am until 11pm, a \"sleep\" from 11pm until 7am and then working a further 8 hours until 3pm. If anything happens during the night and you can't sleep as a result then don't expect to be paid anymore or be relieved by other staff members in the morning. \r\n\r\nDon't expect to be able to have a social life outside of work either. Rotas are most often than not completed at the very last minute so you can never make any plans as you might be working. Management also seem to have a knack of clashing the shift handover with client's regular activities so you are forced to work overtime, unless you're lucky and the next person on shift can meet you and the service-users wherever you may be. \r\n\r\nThe service-users themselves suffer from poor management. If without family or a particularly caring Support Worker then service-users, especially those with learning disabilities are left without a voice. Service-user's homes are often left in a state of disrepair and are only ever sorted out unless absolutely necessary. \r\n\r\nStaff turnover at Creative Support is incredibly high and morale is low. They don't have a HR department, rather they have a few people at head office who deal with HR issues on top of their own work. How they've managed to bag the Investors in People accreditation I'll never know.\r\n\r\nSadly, I'm sure these problems are rife across the across the health industry. Privatisation has meant that \"not for profit\" organisations like Creative Support submit bids for tender for everything and anything, regardless of their ability to provide a good service. Councils will award the contracts to the lowest bidder and that's that. No one regulates the quality of service in any great depth and councils save money."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Investigate", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "18 Nov 2017", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Bradford, Yorkshire and the Humber, England", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Lovely service users and ground staff", "cons": "Diabolical circus run by a set of poorly educated, inept, money orientated and compassionless nitwits.

They'll want you to do everything so they don't have to. \r\n\r\nThe clients that are meant to be supported don't get it, unless it benefits the staff. For example if it's shopping and they want something they'll go for that, if it's for support for dinner and they're hungry then they will take them.

There are loads of staff who have been working for the company for years  who have not been issued an ID.\r\n-Rotas are never correct.

Staff are never acknowledged for this and sometimes the managers even take credit for the work other staff have done. Or staff are expected to stay over without pay to do the work.\r\n-Concerns over the way service users and staff  are treated or how the project is run, is never taken seriously by management. Staff who do voice these concerns are usually targeted with multiple  disciplinaries in a short space of time, warnings and collective bullying from management.\r\n-New staff are regularly   placed at projects without any proper official training or shadow shifts to deal with clients with LD, MH or Challenging behavior. \r\n-Management will sometimes ask staff to do things for them not in their job description.
