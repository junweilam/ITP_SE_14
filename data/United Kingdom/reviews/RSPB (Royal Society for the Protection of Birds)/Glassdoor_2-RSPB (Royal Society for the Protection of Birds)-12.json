As a charity, however, it is important to retain people you have already invested time and costs training in. I do feel, that said, this needs to be remedied as for some people, I did not understand why they were in the roles they were in. \r\n\r\nMembership targets seem to have a bit of unevenness/unfairness depending on where you are. Additionally, as a membership salesperson and thus brand ambassador, you are only measured on memberships made, and not all the smiles and good experiences you give people. That I admit, is hard to avoid.  I did notice a lot of turnover in the MDO roles in my last 8 months or so, which possibly shows something may not be right. \r\n\r\nThe reserve I worked at in my last year was struggling for new footfall, and even though our memberships made to non-member visitor ratio was great, it always felt like we were getting the knife stuck in. Again, hard times for charities so the pressure was on for everyone, but this did not help anyone. The reserve needed to evolve and get some investment put in, and hopefully that happens in the future. \r\n\r\nThe pay issue needs to be mentioned as it has been brought up repeatedly by others. The charity can't just pay market level wages because the projects need the money. Most people realise this and are dedicated enough to the cause to accept that. However, MDOs are not paid enough and there is no financial incentive apart from a discretionary \u00a3500 bonus which is halved after tax anyhow.
