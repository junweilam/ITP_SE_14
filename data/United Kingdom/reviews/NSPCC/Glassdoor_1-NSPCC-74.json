Managers act feel self-important and making decision that favorable to their select few preferred staff members. Friendships between managers and some staff mean theres a lot of biased and unfair decisions, opportunities and working practices. Some staff have experienced concerns about racism by some managers and staff. Far to many bad experiences so I decided to leave this stressful, toxic and negative work environment. No work life balance possible due to lots of unsociable and changing work hours. Illegal work practices as dont faciliate staff being able to have breaks on a daily or regular basis due to poor staffing ratio and managers never interested to manager staffing issues or step in to help. Complaints about managers and staff are not taken seriously or result in any improvements in work environment. No induction, training or support provided. Poor pay.
