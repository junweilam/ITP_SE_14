If you're lucky you'll be introduced to a number of people when you arrive but once you are ready to start working and start asking questions it will all go quiet and the answer will be to go and ask someone else and be sent in circles.\r\n\r\nThis is a very endogamic institution both academically and in professional services.  Many couples both working there or family members.  This is the norm, it's accepted and it's run like a club. There are non-written lines of communication different groups and decision making  processes that don't correspond to the published structure, you only know them if you're part of the club.\r\n\r\nThere is a plan to make the university smaller in number of academic units and number of students. Also to focus on certain academic areas in science and health. \r\n\r\nThe income is too reliant on home undergraduate students and as number of these lowers funding becomes a problem. There's a push to attract foreign students with high fees but as the institution's workforce is 90%  local (in academic and admin services) the environment is not the right one. The lack of transparency doesn't help.\r\n\r\nThe institution has had 3 major re-estructures in the last 5 years so systems can't cope with changes and databases become obsolete very quickly, same with any processes. People know that and keep their own data but as a newcomer you'll be asked to populate data or set up processes for which the people that have been there before already have a non-written process and a full set of data built over the years. \r\n\r\nIt's impossible to find who is who and who does what as there is no information in the external pages or the intranet, you only get to know by staying there for 20 years. When you raise a question or a problem you are automatically shut down or sent on an endless conquest for information.\r\n\r\nRecently the institution announced that it needed to cut \u00a320million from July 2019 to July 2020 (all over the papers) and would open a Voluntary Exit Scheme, this was suppose to be monitored carefully so the institution won't loose any business critical staff. In reality all applications must have been accepted because some units went over the target they had. In addition at the same time we're letting people go to reduce costs we're also asking part-time staff to increase their working hours, does that make sense? \r\n\r\nPeople go without Annual Appraisals for years. This is not monitored by senior staff in your unit. I've seen a number of people recruited to a certain job description to then be asked to help on something else that then becomes the job. \r\n\r\nThere's very strong culture of communication by e-mail so you can cover your back.
