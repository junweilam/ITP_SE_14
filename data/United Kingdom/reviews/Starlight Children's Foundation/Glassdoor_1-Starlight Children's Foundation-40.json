Inability to see the bigger picture,instead prefer  focusing on petty issues. Waste a lot of the publics money on unnecessary networking events for CE. Paid a lot, to do very little, and never challenged by trustees. Wouldn't survive in a commercial world. small world thinking, inability to see the bigger picture. A lot of staff have never worked in an office environment before. Very female dominated which leads to very clicky teams and classroom office with lots of girls giggling and talking loudly all day! Beware you have to scream on your birthday when you cut the cake. Lol Bizarre company. Good Luck"}], []]
