Staff show clear favouritism towards students, certain students are given senior paid positions which creates unfairness in shift allocation and an unusual dynamic between students as well as breaching GDPR. Communication between departments is nonexistent and everything needs constant chasing up. Visiting American students are entitled and rude and make campus unbearable. Terrible company culture and history of discrimination, gossip and normalised sexual harassment between staff/students, no amount of enforcing policy would fix this. The University is ran by incompetent people who constantly hire more incompetent people. Zero regard for mental health and no sense of fairness.
