 Both offline and online programs can be great l if your field director is good.   Working directly with activists and having a chance to impact their work positively is one of the main drive forces of this work.  Chance to be involved in a great variety of programs and projects is not to be missed. As a junior staff member you will be able to develop dozens of transferable skills.,0.0002933216,0.00041117187,0.9992955
 NDI is an old bureaucratic machine. Decision making often is stalled on top and when a decision finally made due dates put a lot of pressure on the team.  The selection of field directors can seem resulting from nepotism and sometimes can become detrimental to the field office's mission. Meanwhile if you are lucky working under the leadership of a good director it can be very challenging rewarding and inspirational work.  As in many NGOs burnout is a great issue especially for junior staff. Some field offices are understaffed with assistants due to challenging and confidential work.  Hence burnout and turnover.  Career growth is very difficult for junior staff in the field offices. You are likely to get stuck in around 2 years.,0.99671054,0.002892201,0.0003972077
