Staff are treated very poorly by the management and those in roles of power. There's a lot of bias discrimination favoritism and cronyism that is embedded in the culture of this University especially since the last 23 years.   It causes a lot of mental anguish for staff who are repressed and treated poorly. In many units staff are discouraged from speaking up.  Managers bully staff and this is mostly done one on one behind closed doors. In the open the conversation is all beautiful and this is the charade that hides their unprofessional behaviour.   UNPROFESSIONAL with very poor people skills.  People who seek help from these bullies are just disregarded discouraged or not taken seriously. Bullies operate freely and are protected right from the top  the main bully.    This is a very depressing place to work in. It causes a lot of mental anguish to staff who speak about it privately but they know there is nothing that can be done as long as these people remain on Campus.,0.99870837,0.0011056649,0.00018597694

I wish I have found these comments at this website before. You will never see such lowquality students in your life!!!!  This campus has extremely terrible reputation. Even local companies dislike the graduates from this campus. This is because as long as you have money you can enroll in this campus. The quality of the students is therefore very very poor.  Cheating faking results and plagiarism among students frequently occur possibly owing to irresponsibility delinquency and lazy attitude.  Overall this campus is full of spoiled kids not only from local students but also from the third world  Heavy teaching load!!! If your teaching unit has 200 students then you will have about 10 labs  10 tutorials  1 lecture. Each one is two hours.  If some students skipped your class due to personal reasons these students will ask you to provide replacements. Otherwise it is your fault and your annual KPI fails.,0.9990023,0.0008371841,0.00016053811

"The administration is a nightmare to deal with â€“ especially HR which holds a lot of mismanaged power over employees. Faculty haven't been paid on time benefits are delayed reimbursement and compensation for professional expenses are a constant battle with faculty administration and HR. When I arrived the administration didn't even know I was coming (even though I signed the contract many months ago). It took weeks to get an email address access to moodle keys to my office a computer for my office etc. And again every little thing that should be a given for a new employee is a selfadvocating battle you have fight with admin.  The morale of the faculty here I could only best describe as ""toxic."" All of my colleagues seem to have complaint after complaint and most are constantly on the hunt for a new job which is definitely telling.  The placement of the university's campus is incredibly inconvenient and don't believe the university website when it tells you that it has ""easy access"" to KL. It doesn't. Not at all. On average it takes about 2 hours to get to KLCC via public transportation. It's a campus in the middle of nowhere.  There have been numerous safety concerns on and off campus and many students have reported sexual harassment assault and theft. The security on campus is pretty inept and don't expect the local police to do anything to help.  The salary is quite low for expats with good qualifications and only allows for a lower middle class existence at best in KL.  lack of transparency and bad management It's difficult to gain an upgrade. Employees on the same Level job do vastly different amounts of work and hard work is no recognized.

High staff turnover. No salary increment you will stuck with the same salary for years but keep on getting appointment letter for additional task. It is almost impossible to get promoted.  The top management (SEGi Group) too ambitious in giving new direction but with minimal resources and short period. Standardizing across centre very difficult as some of them not cooperative. Too many bosses to attend and getting approval.  The yearly KPI doesn't make sense to some job function as being setup by non related department/person in charge which know/expert the for the respective job. Senior staff/existing staff which have works like forever in SEGi not really productive and innovative lack of technology skills unwilling to learn and refuse to go out from their comfort zone.,0.9991322,0.00071267056,0.00015511415

7 years I was with SEGi and I have to say:  staff turnover is very high.  facilities still so bad.  parking is the worst.  lifts breakdown 23 times a month.  top management only care for money.  lecturers under qualified or unqualified to teach; e.g. fresh graduate SEGi student still awaiting final year result teaching diploma and/or degree students.  No recognition or appreciation for staff contributions only care for top sales staffs the rest are considered as dirt.  whatever recommendation/idea the top management ask you give them they let it go in one ear and come out the other ear and said your idea sucks but then later use it and said it is their idea. So low class.  fees every month/year increase but facilities still the same since 2007.  staffs don't work together for the greater good. All work for themselves and selfish to the point that stealing others sales is the way to go.,0.9990245,0.0008156517,0.00015985267

It is the perfect job if you like speaking with people from all over the world and identifying those who are refugees. An interest in sociology world geography political science international humanitarian and international refugee law would be most helpful in your work. Applicants for international protection approach UNHCR to tell their stories and it was our jobs as Eligibility Caseworkers to assist to record their personal narratives of their flight from their countries of origin to help them see if they fell within the international definition of a refugee as UNHCR identifies refugees for international society to protect. This was heady and interesting work and one often felt like one was doing good work when the going was good. It felt like we were saving the world one refugee applicant at a time.,0.0044409367,0.15526386,0.8402952
There are many downsides to working with UNHCR but for a long while it was countermanded by the sheer exhilaration of our work that saved refugees.  Here are the cons. The list is not exhaustive.  a) the revolving door of international managers heads of units and head of office that appear like clockwork. Each new supervisor fresh off the boat wants to place their stamp on the office by changing what isn't broken by modifying SOPs by modifying workflows to what suits them by picking and choosing which refugee policies they want to follow or discard and by relying too heavily on politics and ignoring the importance of IHL and IRL in the determination of refugee status. Refugees and asylumseekers thus get sacrificed regularly on the altar of this revolving door of international managers.  2) the local staff who allow themselves to get sidetracked by incompetent and political managers for the sake of some scraps from the career pile. They sell out the refugee protection mandate when they do not insist that the revolving door of managers respect and abide by the refugee protection mandate even when it is not politicallly expedient to do so.  3) Managers who feel that all staff below them are beneath them and should be mere yesmen.  4) People who seek promotion by backstabbing peers and colleagues.  5) Representatives who play favourites and turn a blind eye to megalomaniacal middle management colleagues in their midst.  6) Representatives who are themselves megalomaniacs.  7) Incompetent managers who hide their incompetence by being nasty to colleagues. Forcing out colleagues they dislike or are threatened by through a series of SOP changes and constant amendments to team workflow and workloads. Refusing to approve annual leave the whole year and then forcing staff to burn their excess annual leave which can no longer be carried over then getting vindictive when HR allows the staff member to clear their leave. 8) Accusing all and sundry of fraud and misconduct just because they do not understand the established forms and practices set in place by the RSD SOPs which they have failed to read and digest before criticizing staff. Getting upset because they do not know how to use proGres software and thinking everyone is just like them.  9) Forgetting that caseworkers are hired to do casework and not to be their clerical and admin assistants. There is a team for that.  10) This list is not exhaustive but I will stop here.,0.9984034,0.0014574667,0.00013918283

"The administration is a nightmare to deal with â€“Â especially HR which holds a lot of mismanaged power over employees. Faculty haven't been paid on time benefits are delayed reimbursement and compensation for professional expenses are a constant battle with faculty administration and HR. When I arrived the administration didn't even know I was coming (even though I signed the contract many months ago). It took weeks to get an email address access to moodle keys to my office a computer for my office etc. And again every little thing that should be a given for a new employee is a selfadvocating battle you have fight with admin.   The morale of the faculty here I could only best describe as ""toxic."" All of my colleagues seem to have complaint after complaint and most are constantly on the hunt for a new job which is definitely telling.   The placement of the university's campus is incredibly inconvenient and don't believe the university website when it tells you that it has ""easy access"" to KL. It doesn't. Not at all. On average it takes about 2 hours to get to KLCC via public transportation. It's a campus in the middle of nowhere.   There have been numerous safety concerns on and off campus and many students have reported sexual harassment assault and theft. The security on campus is pretty inept and don't expect the local police to do anything to help.   The salary is quite low for expats with good qualifications and only allows for a lower middle class existence at best in KL.   There is virtually no time and resources to do research even though publications are the expectation.",0.9986333,0.0011498084,0.00021685344

Thoughtless and irresponsible she then blames her employees. Terrible person all in all.  The COO is the CEO's lackey. She micromanages a lot but she is not a terrible person.

"If you are joining the Recruitment Admissions and Marketing department expect the few things below.  1) Micromanagement. The top management here thinks that the best way to manage the people is by micromanaging them. Expect a lot of daily meetings questions on what you are doing and decisions from top to bottom.  2) Numbers numbers and numbers. End of the day the management here only cares about the numbers. If the numbers do not look good it means you are not doing your work. However they fail to understand that the factors affecting the numbers are not something that the staff can control.  3) Lots of reports summaries and justifications. Be prepared to be questioned even if you would like to raise a minimal payment. The management here has serious trust issues and do take note that managers head of departments do not have authority to approve payments. Expect to write a lot of reports on your performance and summaries on even the slightest thing.  4) Poor synergy among colleagues. Just imagine if you do not even know the people in the HR department. Colleagues from other departments tend to avoid providing support and you will end up doing more than you are supposed to do.  5) Toxic team members. There will be toxic colleagues within the department and organisation who will badmouth and undermine your efforts. Avoid them if you would like to stay sane. Besides they are easy to be spotted as they will always try to outshine the others.  6) Poor work life balance. Expect to do more than what's outlined in your JD and work on weekends. Working long hours is normal here.  7) Lack of appreciation for your efforts. As the team is rather lean here you will always be pressured to do more and beyond. However the problem lies when you are not appreciated but instead always pressured and criticised for not doing a 'perfect' job when you can only do so much within your limits.   8) Lack of actions by the management. You can raise 1000 issues to them and they will eventually sweep it under the carpet.   9) Lack of a good business plan. No solid strategies or tactics to achieve the end goal. The direction is rather unclear and you will always be told to ""figure it out yourself"".",0.9987889,0.0010531493,0.00015805206
