It was a horrible interview experience. There was a lady who were shouting non stop during an online interview. She shouts to ask question basically. Felt kinda racist too. Also felt so obvious that she was like showing her hands pointing to me and saying she is not a good fit and stuff.   It doesn't matter someone is fit or not fit for the position they've applied for. The interviewer should be professional handling the interview. I totally lose interest in answering any questions after all the shouting and stuff. I am surprise well known university like Segi has people like that. Imagine students who are studying there. How would they be treated?,0.9985189,0.0013301336,0.00015092043
