 salaries far lower than the market average  TOP management exercise their authority in an unjustifiable arrogant way not allowing any discussion even on topics where their knowledge is subzero which is totally inappropriate for an NGO and a small subsidiary like SITS  without paying well you can't get the good staff with a very few exceptions which came in due to personal motivation  despite it's an NGO and should pay attention to the money which come entirely from donations there is no effort to migrate to opensource solutions in fact Microsoft representatives always win their way into it by buying dinners and invitations at cool locations  they promise help will be hired to support you but that never comes  it's all about politics and job security (especially in Geneva),0.99824476,0.001474862,0.0002803269
