1. They prioritize appeasing their NGO network and the incountry partnerships over the support and safety of their fellows. Will send you to a newly recruited organization without even telling them. Will side with that organization and not support you their talent. (It can work out if the organization is wellfunded and has had several rounds of fellows previously. But definitely not the norm for fellows.) 2. Dont believe the GHC family hype. They will stand by idly if your organization mistreats you. If the org failed to arrange housing dont expect GHC to find something for you. Nope you'll be backpacking to work for months literally. They say they provide furnished housing dont be surprised if you spend your stipend on furniture (fridge stove etc) They oust people for little to no reason. Was told I would be living alone (the sole reason I left my former fulltime position) but was placed in a house with a racist roommate. When I complained I was put on 90 probation. i begged for help and was told I was wasting GHC resources. Dont bet your last on this or you could wind up back home unexpectedly (without any warning) and jobless. Or worse missing like Stukey. Google GHC and stukey to learn about that debacle. They only responded after Zambian media got involved.  3. For them to tout professional development as they do do not expect it to be guaranteed for everyone (only a privileged few). If thats what you're looking for ask the incountry org if they offer it. If not dont go because GHC will do nothing for you. My org basically used us for free grunt work. We werent allowed in trainings conferences or barely on work trips. Even though we both carried multiple masters degrees they called us Data Entry volunteers. When we complained GHC shushed us. My org later cooked up some untrue story completely unrelated to their immense satisfaction with my work quality (likely because i did the work of 4 senior staff members). Nobody informed me there was an issue but a tribunal was held and it was decided I should go (even though my probationary period expired no one ever even contacted my direct supervisor). The timing of everything was perfectly contrived. What about that helped me develop professionally? Nothing  The recruitment is directed towards entry to mid career professionals but they dont respect them as such in Africa. If you are such and are used to being viewed as a colleague go with GHFPII. Its more official and supportive for adults accustomed to earning and performing.,0.9982033,0.0016452323,0.00015151453

Academic institution run like a call centre. No career mentorship or growth.  Poor medical curriculum. Not up to standards compared to other universities in the region.  Hugh attrition rates because of rigid processes that admin is too stubborn to look at and change.  There is no trust to do ones job. Micromanagement at every stage.  Cannot suggest anything new. They pretend they are open to suggestions when they are not. Claim to be pioneers in use of technology but it's use many times cripples both ability to do the job as well as the learning ability of the students. The scientific process is not followed by academic staff as it is not encouraged. Neither is it taught to students or practised. Efficiency and result over effectiveness. Unnecessary long weekend hours.   Spying culture using cameras. And loss of pay for small mistakes like forgetting to wear ID card for a few hours or using phone to approve Google login.  Unqualified people in management positions. As a result have no idea how to run an academic institution and implement unreasonable requirements. A bit of racist culture. If you are not Indian you can never get any requests approved.,0.9990927,0.00075909926,0.00014819167
