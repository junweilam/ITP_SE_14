Took around 2 months in total from initial interview to final offer. Was told that there were around 180 applicants in 2023. \r\n\r\nNote that HR prefers to contact applicants via phone (i.e., calling) rather than through email. \r\n\r\nFirst round / physical HR interview - typical screening by HR, comprehensive discussion surrounding your resume. HR seemed very tired (probably depends on the timing of your interview), and wanted straight-to-the-point answers. Things like, \"tell me about this project you did...\" or \"share more about this internship experience you have...\". \r\n\r\nIf you have progressed to the next round, it might take around 2 weeks to hear back. \r\n\r\nSecond round / online IQ test - this test was sprang on the applicants suddenly, because HR said that the next round proceeding the first interview would only be a physical psychometric assessment. Hence, applicants only had 1-2 days to complete the IQ test. However, more than enough time was provided in terms of the test's time limit and the it mainly consisted of numerical questions. \r\n\r\nThird round / physical psychometric assessment - mind-blogging and strange assessment that seems a bit traditional. Consisted of group case study (tied to university context), role play (literally), individual case presentation. Was one of the most tiring physical assessment I had done. Most of the staff present looked very angry and sad (maybe because of the timing of the sessions) but the mood livened up during the roleplay activity. \r\nDue to the nature and intensity of the physical assessment tasks, one might expect that the compensation would be quite high because of the rigour that NTU seemingly requires of their management associates. Disclaimer is that the physical assessment round lasted for 4 hours. \r\nDuring these activities, you would be able to tell that the staff typically face challenges of: \r\n- unlimited tasks but limited time \r\n- expectation from management surpass actual capabilities \r\n- frequent negative feedback from customers (aka students) \r\n- a few more but I forgot about them already \r\n\r\nFinal round / physical tea session with senior management - consisted of 4 sections in a room. Each section had around 8-10 chairs arranged in a circle (no table in between). A few chairs taken up by candidates, the other chairs were occupied by the senior management. \r\nSenior management included individuals such as the C-suite, director etc. There were around 16-20 senior management present. They split into 4 groups to sit with different sections. After around 20 mins, the time would be up, and the senior management would rotate to a different section. \r\n\r\nQuestions typically included, \"why do you want to join NTU?\", \"do you know that you can't make a lot of money at NTU, so why do you choose us?\", \"where else have you applied?\", \"compared to NTU, the places that you applied are bigger companies, so how do you choose among them?\", \"where do you see yourself in 5-10 years time?\". Honestly, a lot of the questions made it seem like there is no future at NTU.... Also, each group of senior management asked almost the exact same thing, so you just have to pretend to be a broken record that day. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that disappointed me greatly was when it was the candidates' turn to ask questions, some senior management were flabbergasted that they were being \"interviewed\". But isn't recruitment a 2-way street these days? In the end, left this session feeling extremely drained. \r\n\r\nOffer was given around 2-3 weeks after the final round.", "Interview Questions": "N/A"}, {"date": "20 Apr 2023", "title": "Research Engineer 1 Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Positive Experience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied through an employee referral.\u00a0The process took 4 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) in Dec 2022", "Interview Descriptions": "Interview was simple, casual, friendly.

Then the prof arranged a face-to-face interview in the office (which could also be done by Skype).\r\n\r\nThe interview process was in a very relaxed atmosphere. The focus was on my past working experience and projects. So try to make it clear about what you have done in the past, and prepare 1-2 project in more details, e.g. what was the project, what technology in the project could be transferred to the new project in future. And also there were some general questions such as why do you want to work in Singapore and why do you want to work in the university. At the end of the interview, I was asked to provide 2 referees to send my reference letters.\r\n\r\nAfter the prof received my reference letters, I was asked to do a small project to demonstrate my expertise in the field, and of course the project was not to difficult and was related and similar to the future work. So please do not be afraid of that. Just believe in yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished that small project, the prof and I met again in the office, discussed the details about that work. And I got an immediate offer orally by the end of the day, followed by HR process and paper work. However, the HR process was extremely time consuming, and I waited 3 month for the official offer letter by the university, in which the salary was fixed and there was no negotiation.
