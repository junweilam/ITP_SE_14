They were the ones that asked me about it so why ask about something you clearly hate and think is beneath your species? I replied \"they're cute so it doesn't matter\" and she looked as if she was jealous of a dog. The other woman was no better. Asked about my previous company like they have some preoccupation about the past and when I answered what I didn't like about it (they didn't properly guide newcomers), she said, \"they never hold your hand?\" dripping with sarcasm as if my reply could possibly be wrong when it is literally an opinion question she asked. And there is a clear difference between common sense to guide newbies and hand-holding. Again, if you don't want an answer then don't ask.

He also asked whether I could write papers for grants which I came to understand it is his job scope as a professor.   When I mentioned I did not have some of those I don't have (I knew about 70% of what he asked already), he went, \"Oh, the kinds of job you had usually had your name on the publications last. People like you are good at analyzing things but had so much difficulty writing papers.\" \r\n\r\nTo be reasonable, he is paying less than S$3000 for this RA position and he is demanding intellectual work which is more likely his job scope.Then he should have asked for first authorships in his job criteria.\r\n\r\nAfter I hanged up, I felt that he probably saw me a waste of time so he asked me to call him.
