This was tediously long and required me to fill in the exact same details that were already on my CV. The online application took approximately 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter I was shortlisted, a representative from HR contacted me and directed me to fill in ANOTHER form with the exact same details that were on my CV and which I had also entered into the 1st form.\r\n\r\nAfter this was done, a Zoom interview was set up for 2 weeks later. \r\n\r\n# Interview\r\nThe interview was held over Zoom, and was done by the HR representative, along with 2 other current lab techs from the Virology Lab (which was the lab with the job opening).\r\n\r\nThe interview lasted 45minutes, although the Zoom call did cut off halfway in, possibly due to it being a free Zoom call instead of the enterprise version. There were no issues with the interview process, and the interviewers involved were friendly.\r\n\r\n# Offer\r\n2 weeks after the interview, I received a call informing me that I had passed the interview and that they were intending to extend an offer of $3300 (I had initially asked for $3800).\r\n\r\nI requested for a formal letter of offer, which was flat out refused, and instead I was informed that the details of the offer would be sent to me in an email. The offer details was sent rather unprofessionally, with the details written in an HTML table within the message body of the email itself, instead of a formal document letter of offer.\r\n\r\nThe email (which was sent at 2.30pm in the afternoon) requested that I give a favourable response \"by tomorrow\". I replied to request for a week to think it over, and got a very discourteous response telling me that I had 3 days to make a decision.\r\n\r\n# Negotiating the Salary\r\nI attempted to negotiate the initial offer of $3300  to $3500, and was informed, quote, \"as explained over the phone, the degree start rate is harmonised across all Singapore public hospitals. We will not pay anything above our offer of $3,300.\"\r\n\r\nThis response is extremely rude and was shocking as it basically portrayed SGH as a toxic, inflexible work environment that is simply not open to constructive discourse, instead choosing to confront candidates with rude ultimatums, as if trying to diminish a candidate's self-worth and bully the candidate into accepting. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this information about the degree start rate being fixed was news to me, as this had not been \"mentioned over the phone\" as claimed. The only thing related that I was informed about was that the salary RANGES depended on the level of our degree. As any dictionary will show, a range does not just have one fixed number.\r\n\r\nThe information that all public hospitals' degree start rate are \"harmonised\" seems to contradict crowdsourced pay information such as those from Glassdoor, which leads one to question the exact motive behind putting forward such a logical fallacy without empirical evidence.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the interview experience started out well, but devolved into a bad experience that left a horrible impression of all public health services efficiency and mannerisms.", "Interview Questions": "Q: What do you think are the most important character traits a MLT should have?"}], [{"date": "13 Oct 2020", "title": "Associate Executive Interview", "results": "Accepted Offer", "experience": "Negative\nExperience", "difficulties": "Easy Interview", "Application Type": "I applied online.\u00a0The process took 3 weeks.\u00a0I interviewed at Singapore General Hospital (Singapore) in Sept 2020", "Interview Descriptions": "The interview was very straight forward.
