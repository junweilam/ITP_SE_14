After about 2 weeks later, the hiring manager called me during lunch to describe the job to me and find out my interest. When I told him that I was interested, he arranged a virtual interview 2 days later with himself and his department director. His director talked non-stop for an hour during the interview to describe the job to me in much detail. At the end of interview, I indicated my interest. The same day itself, the hiring manager called me at 6 pm to ask whether I am available to attempt a written assignment. I was required to write an essay (1 page or less) about what I know about the job after the interview and how I can contribute to make the project a success. The written assignment must be submitted within 3 hours. After that, the final interview with HR, neutral director and the hiring director was more than 2 weeks later. The final interview lasted slightly longer than an hour and questions asked were related to how I manage project and even details like personal interests and family members. A week after the final interview, there was no news. I checked with the HR interviewer and was informed that they are still considering my application. Another week later, I had 2 other offers to consider but I prefer this job the most. The HR interviewer again informed me that they have not come to a conclusion yet.
