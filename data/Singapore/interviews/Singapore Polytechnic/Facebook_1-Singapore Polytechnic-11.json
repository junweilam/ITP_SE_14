Here's my little tale.\r\n\r\nMy first contact with SP was through email, with someone from HR (let's call her Ms A). We arranged for the interview date and time after a few exchanges. It's quite strange that she never once did reveal her phone number, nor did she call me.  All these \"to-and-fro\" could have been much shortened.\r\n\r\nDays after I've got the interview arranged, a different person from HR called me (let's call her Ms B), wanting to arrange for an interview! She seemed totally unaware that I already have one arranged by Ms A. I told her about this and she never called back.\r\n\r\nFast forwarding to the day of the interview, I met up with a full-time lecturer (let's call him Mr C). He was cordial and things seemed to go quite well. I had some questions about the level and depth of the course material I was supposed to teach and he agreed to send me the course synopsis. At the end of the interview, he mentioned that he would put up a recommendation to his bosses for a second interview. The second interview would be where I would meet his bosses.\r\n\r\nDays went by and I did not hear from Mr C.\r\n\r\nEven more days went by and I heard from yet another HR staff - let's call her Ms D. She called me up wanting to arrange a first interview. I told her that I've met up with Mr C and wondered why she was arranging for one. She said something about Mr C's wish to arrange this interview. Had he forgotten that we've met?!  Ms D replied that she would check back with Mr C.\r\n\r\nThen I did not hear any more from them.\r\n\r\nI could overlook all these if my livelihood did not depend on this queer bunch.
