The questions asked by the two interviewees I had were relevant and carefully thought of. The interview felt more of a conversation because I was at my best self and there was no intimidation. I wish all other interviews were like that! I didn't get the job but I didn't feel bad at all because I was treated in a way that made me feel I mattered and my opinion counted. I was also given constructive feedback (through email) a few days after the interview.
