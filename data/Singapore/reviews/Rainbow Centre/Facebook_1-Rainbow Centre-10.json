Communication issue between everyone leading the lower position holders (teachers, senior learning facilitators, learning facilitators, class support to suffer). Lead Teacher wants Teachers and learning facilitator to do this but Senior Teacher says another.\r\n3. Organization only values TRAINED staff but not untrained and experienced staff. \r\n4. Lead Teachers and Teaching and Learning Specialist have their own preferred group of staff. These staff will always get the good, almost academic class. Once you get into their group, you will get to go for the diploma in special education earlier than those who waited for more than 5 years. These group of staff often get the most for performance bonus because no incident report and have the likings of the lead teacher and teaching and learning specialist. \r\n5. Constant threats by senior teachers and lead teachers\r\n6. Taking leave is difficult, most staff had to beg to take leave for caregiving issues. On a few occasions, lead teacher will ask you to come back before you get to see the doctor (no violation of labour laws if you have not taken your mc). \r\n---- Management has no empathy. Teaching staff (Teacher, Learning Facilitator, Class Support) want to take leave by sending message and email to management but no reply. Want to take leave for urgent family matters or exam leave also need to beg the management level holders to ask for clearance to have the leave. \r\n7. Several occasions, low position holders were asked to come back by the lead teachers and were not allowed to go to the doctors despite reporting of being sick on that day.\r\n8. Once a month you will need to work two shifts if you are a teacher or learning facilitator.\r\n9. Does not care about lower position teaching staff safety especially during the Covid situation by asking them to go to multiple classroom. They do not adhere to SMM. If the senior teacher does not want to go into a class whom a student had Covid, they will deploy the lower position teaching staff."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "No", "Business Outlook":
