Staff benefits are not adequately evaluated, and office bearers, such as the President and Sec Gen/IMH, have been awarded enormous permanent offices at HQ. Why do they receive free parking, cash cards, and mobile phone allowances as volunteers? If you don't believe, check the annual report and the financial statement! Are they receiving additional allowances that have not been reported? What about reimbursements that are not recorded? Employees do not receive such benefits.
