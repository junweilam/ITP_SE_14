classes\r\n\r\n- Nice facilities (such as gyms, swimming pool, recreation room, basketball courts, library, and various canteens)\r\n\r\n- Teaching can provide a fulfilling experience, especially for those who prefer working closely with students, since lecturers teach a small class size of only 25 students in RP's PBL pedagogy", "cons": "- Work becomes mundane after a while (e.g. lecturers repeatedly teach a handful of modules and the concepts taught are very rudimentary in nature).\r\n\r\n- Strong emphasis on 'extra-curricular activities' in work review. Daily work such as teaching, mentoring, and marking will not lend much weight during work review and lecturers are expected to embark on industry projects, develop new CET courses, or lead key events in order to achieve a good performance grade at year end.\r\n\r\n- Narrow salary range in each salary band. Under the ITE Polytechnic Scheme, the distance between the minimum vs maximum salary under each band is about $2+ thousand dollars. This means that a lecturer can reach the wage ceiling in his/her band rather quickly (sometimes as fast as 3 years). This creates an endless cycle to push yourself to perform to get a B grade (which is needed on the year of your promotion), otherwise you suffer from a lack of increment that year. Many colleagues in RP have in fact been stuck at their salary band for many years (some even as long as 10 years).\r\n\r\n- Under RP's PBL system, students are usually assigned a grade by the lecturer based on their performance in each lesson. This process can sometimes become political as students wants to get good grades (sometimes regardless of their performances in class). Students can question the grades you gave them in the prior week and gets upset when the grades fall short of their expectation. This means that sometime, lecturers do give students an inflated grade, just to appease their students whom they have to face week-in, week-out. The grading becomes a process of appeasement instead of based on actual performance in class.\r\n\r\n- Management's lack of emphasis on staff's professional development. Management pay lip service by repeating the mantra that we need to develop future-ready skills but there is a lack of concrete plans on how the staff should go about doing this. There is in place a Industry Associate Scheme ('IAS') whereby lecturers can be 'attached' to a company in the industry to pick up practical knowledge but there is no offloading of work if a lecturer chooses to go for the attachment. As a result, the lecturer juggles between meeting the expectation of the industry partner during the attachment (there is often a project carved out for completion during the IAS), while completing his/her normal duties in RP."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Noted", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "19 Dec 2021", "job_title": "Lecturer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Highly recommended.
