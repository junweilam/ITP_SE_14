Their understanding nature shines through their speech and their action which makes it really helpful as the days here can be very challenging", "cons": "- Constant change in processes makes it very difficult to keep up. The processes here can change on the fly without being formally informed to the team. Considered yourself lucky if you were informed about it. \n- Too many leaders but no leadership. \n- No sense of ownership or accountability within the team which makes the already confusing work place even more challenging to work in. \n- Calls are left without being put on break mode which causes it to be abandoned till it goes to the next available person. Issue was finally caught before I left the place. \n- No one actually follow up with their cases promptly therefore causing delays and complain by users and staffs. \n- No equal access to the Systems across all team members which make our efficient level drop. \n- Not wanting to train new hire even before the new hire was onboarded. One of the seniors went on a rant and decided to not be available on the week when the new hire was onboarded to avoid training them. \n- Using other colleague's name to sign off is a trend for some reason here. I've been caught in such situation multiple times and had to confront them accordingly. \n- Empowerment to make decision. Almost everything had to be checked again and again to confirm there\u2019s no change in process. Get\u2019s very annoying. \n- Trust is very much broken within the team which is the most annoying thing to happen. Do not always assume those who are newly hired into the team are inexperienced. It is not in your right to judge anyone who joins the team. \n- In summary, easily one of the most demoralising place to work because there's no sense of belonging or achievement here."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Good salary and working environment", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "4 Nov 2021", "job_title": "Anonymous Employee in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good salary and working environment", "cons": "Overall, I think it is good.
