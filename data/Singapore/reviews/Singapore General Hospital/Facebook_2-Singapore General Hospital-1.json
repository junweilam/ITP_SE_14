You can and will learn a lot from your senior colleagues who are probably at the top of their fields in Singapore and on par with the best in the world. - Decent pay. You can definitely afford a condominium as a consultant (albeit a small one)", "cons": "-Leadership is almost always based on seniority, and the same senior staff get promoted to (higher) positions of leadership. The young have much less say/influence. Stuck in same old ways of (group) think and politics - Research, education, innovation always take a backseat to clinical service. With the ageing population, there is just so much clinical work to do that ultimately, we become a service hospital rather than an academic centre. It's fine honestly, since that's what hospitals should do first and foremost. But please don't say we're an academic centre when we honestly don't prioritise research, education and innovation with time, money and manpower. - Resources for research, education and innovation, when done, are concentrated in the hands of a few very established groups/individuals. It is very difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold into these as the support ecosystems (e.g. armies of clinical research coordinators/administrative support) just do not exist. - Pay, while decent, in no way reflects the times we are in. Volume AND complexity of work have increased tremendously in the past few years (not talking about past decade- just the past few years COVID notwithstanding). Inflation has skyrocketed. Yet pay has not shifted up. Locum rates for consultants have not changed for 2 decades/have changed only for certain departments. Burnout is rampant. I presume this will only get worse with the new per-capitation model, where the govt gives a fixed budget to each hospital for the population it serves (which, quite frankly, does not make any sense since an ageing population with a high life expectancy is necessarily a medically complex population, where no amount of preventive health measures can prevent the ordering of investigations to troubleshoot when they come to hospital for undifferentiated symptoms. The only way you can curb unbridled/thoughtless healthcare spending is if you do something un-politically correct like saying after the age of 85 or 90, or if you have been deemed to have <6 months of life expectancy, you have no more subsidies for certain investigations/treatments. )"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Salary range", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "4 May 2023", "job_title": "Senior Patient Service Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Work life balance Friendly working environment", "cons": "Quite difficult for career progression"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 1, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Bad", "rating": "1.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 May 2023", "job_title": "Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nothing good, just rubbish rubbish", "cons": "Dont even give you proper work desk, make you work in some rubbish area (National Cancer Centre Singapore)"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": 1, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Nice work, challenging environment.", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "16 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Nuclear Medicine Technologist in Outram Park,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Meaningful work, well-defined working hours.", "cons": "Inconsistent direction, unreliable support/ resources."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Great learning opportunities", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "12 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Manager in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Offers a good exposure to healthcare and innovation", "cons": "Staff welfare benefits are not great"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Amazing", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "10 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Pharmacy Assistant in Outram Park,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Nearby hospital Mr Bean is nice 7 eleven <3", "cons": "Need to climb the hill"}], [{"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 1, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Na", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "11 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Occupational Therapist in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "It had a big OT department- good for supervision", "cons": "Not much understanding for work life balance"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": ".", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "9 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Pharmacy Technician in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "learning opportunities, meet nice people", "cons": "busy, low pay, no work life balance, no career progression"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "Sgh review", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "3 Apr 2023", "job_title": "Assistant Manager in Outram Park,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Stable.
