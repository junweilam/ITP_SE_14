About the salary,  Scales are too lower than the industry.they pitch that its non profit organization. IT industry is one of the core department in School and they have budgets for change the carpets not paying salaries? This place giving even lower than the industries lowest margin. They keep the salary scale just above the pass approval rate only. this is the second reason i have left this place. So if u coming here expect that you salary will not increase even if you work here for 3-4 years. Whatever you talk they don't increase. Check with other companies what are the salary scale if you want to join here. \r\n\r\nOverall from those managers, heads are playing politics like boss.
