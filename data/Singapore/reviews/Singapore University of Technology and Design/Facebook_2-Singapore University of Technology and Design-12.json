The management processes are inefficient and pointless, there's a lot of red tape everywhere and the red tape is only there for liability reasons and not to solve any issue in particular. As a matter of fact, a lot of this red tape only makes everything run worse, but I guess it helps to shift the blame is something goes unexpected. New IT tools that are supposed to make employees lives easier do not solve any of these issues and only create additional red tape. Communication of critical information is almost nonexistent and in the cases where you receive this information, it arrives too late. Nevertheless, there is an endless spam of non-relevant information by email. The university is facing serious challenges to survive. The university is sandwiched between the prestige and history of traditional universities in Singapore, and the meteoric rise of new public universities that did not got behind as this one.
