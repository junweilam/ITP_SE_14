Nothing much other than organising conferences and webinar.s How different are they from a commercial healthcare conference organiser? Nothing much, and there are many other better commercial healthcare conferences in the region. Headed by a former Exhibit Manager, there is a serious lack of thought-leadership from HIMSS Asia Pacific. Have you ever hear him speak at healthcare conferences? I guess not, and it shows the lack of thought leadership and not fulfilling the mission of HIMSS."}], []]
