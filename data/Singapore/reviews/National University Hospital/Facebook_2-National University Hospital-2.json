I strongly dissuade fresh graduates to join this competitive department unless they are mentally prepared to be scrutinized deeply.\n\nMost of the senior employees here possess dominant personalities and are not forgiving. Most of them will not hesitate to ruin your career by negatively feed-backing about you behind your back. The purpose is to gain a stronger rapport with their supervisors by exploiting your tiniest of errors.  While it is a fact, that individuals exploit each other to climb through their career ladder, this trait of the employees is deeply embedded in the blood transfusion services culture. Senior employees here will also influence other junior colleagues to have a negative impression of you and therefore creating  an unhealthy working lifestyle for you. In addition, the management there is highly judgemental and unsupportive of your views. They will come down strongly even on the pettiest of issues let alone making accidental mistakes during your course of learning. Additionally, the supervisors will not hesitate to yell and embarrass you in front of your other colleagues at any point during work, while displaying fake professionalism in front of their superiors. To sum it up, the bullying culture exists here if you are targeted.\n\nMy suggestion is to work in other areas of the Laboratory Medicine Department e.g. Chemistry or Haematology ( no guarantee that they do not have the same issue) . You can even try other hospitals where their medical technologist are required to cover all departments. This is where your ceiling to learning is higher. Blood banking is highly specific and your ceiling to learning is capped after a short while, as work here is highly repetitive.\n\n Their preference is to hire juniors. However, it is a trap especially if you have no working experience in a clinical lab ( internship is not counted), as their intentions are to mold you into a yes-man while strongly influencing your views on issues present. \n\nConclusively, I strongly recommend anyone reading this review to accept this opportunity only as a last resort. Salary/benefits are important, but not at the expense of your emotional and mental health. Regardless, there are much better opportunities out there for you."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Good staff benefits.", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "4 Oct 2014", "job_title": "Senior IT Analyst in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The main reason to work here is stability of the industry.", "cons": "Slow career progression and limited exposure.
