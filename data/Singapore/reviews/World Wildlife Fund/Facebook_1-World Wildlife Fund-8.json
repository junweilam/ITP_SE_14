You can expect to hear how the management is \"reviewing the salary structure\", it's a lie. I have heard this for over a year and the only salary bumps you will see happening are your friends\u2019 who do not work in WWF. There is literally ZERO adjustment to your salary unless you get promoted, and even then the pay raise is ridiculously low. What this means is that if you factor in inflation, your purchasing power is literally decreasing year by year. Meanwhile, whatever money the organisation does have goes into hiring consultants who are paid to do the jobs of the management themselves. I get that you don\u2019t enter an NGO for money, but at the very least, shouldn\u2019t a company provide fair wages? What makes this fact even harder to swallow is that we actively advocate for businesses to pay their employees fairly as required by sustainable certifications, but we fail to hold ourselves to the same standards. After seeing this happening for so long, I have decided to stop all my donations to this place. I would rather burn this money than continue giving it away to this bunch of self-serving people.\r\n\r\n- Big egos and a complete lack of understanding towards conservation amongst the management. The former could be addressed if the people in question are willing to learn but unfortunately the majority choose to remain wilfully ignorant or outright refuse to bother. The situation is exacerbated when the management attempts to run this organisation like a private business (e.g. a bank) or like an army. Some of the C-suite level/directors are unable to take no for an answer and will retaliate to make your life utterly miserable. The rest are too scared to stand up for what's right and will simply watch as this happens. Pretty ironic considering how this company claims that its values include courage and integrity. The management fails to see that conservation includes more than protection of habitats, it includes educating the public, holding businesses and governments accountable for their actions. Granted that Singapore\u2019s politics are harder to influence; this does not mean impossible. However, since the board and even some members of the management have connections with the politicians, they are leery of anything that could be seen as \u201ccriticism\u201d. So if you are looking to change Sg in this manner, look elsewhere. There are local NGOs who do a better job than this place.\r\n\r\n- Lack of communication, transparency and trust. This organisation has a nasty habit of springing bad news and key developments/changes (e.g. the changing of our 13th month pay) last minute, usually in the late evening or at night on a Friday. Announcements are made with no proper brief, no proper FAQs and employees are just supposed to roll with it. If this is a tactic to evade potential backlash and give employees time to adapt during the weekend, I would advise you to fire your HR team or whoever that gave you this bright idea. All this does is ruin your employees\u2019 rest as they unnecessarily panic. We often do not know what goes on amongst the management and what are their plans (to be fair, they probably have no idea what they are doing either) \u2013 we are just supposed to execute. Which would be fine, but often times the decisions made are irrational and a waste of donor money. By the way, town halls are not an answer \u2013 nobody wants to sit through 3 hours long town halls. \r\n\r\n- Here\u2019s a special shout out to the HR team: Nobody trusts you. Nobody. Let\u2019s not even talk about protecting the staff. Let\u2019s just talk about how you fail even at the core tenets of your jobs. Number 1: hiring the right person for the role. More often than not, scummy people are hired (even to your own team) and they can\u2019t even do their jobs right. At one point, we even had a HR head that does not know or bother to learn our local labour laws. Granted that he is now gone, but the fact that he was ever hired proves how incompetent this team, and by large, the management team, is. Number 2: career progression. The lack of progression amongst the junior staff is extremely concerning. Pair this up with the phenomenon where you see incidences of expats > locals being promoted to senior/managerial positions; you get a ticking time bomb. Why are your employees constantly forced to jump through so many hoops to be promoted? If they are already doing above and beyond what their JD is, shouldn\u2019t this be cause for promotion?? Why the over emphasis on the number of years of work exp/services? Why are you not evaluating based on competency and achievements? 3: Employee retention. In the first quarter of the year, the number of people leaving this organisation is in the double digits and this does not seem like it will end. Isn\u2019t this high time to take a good hard look at yourself and admit where you are screwing up? It\u2019s not hard, you can dig up the recent exit interviews.\r\n\r\n- Double standards. New employees are expected to have the necessary skills/knowledge to do their jobs when they are hired. Afterwards, they have a probation period to evaluate and confirm that they know how to do their jobs. I don\u2019t think this requirement is being imposed on our management. We have seen two CEOs now that do not know or understand conservation work despite the fact that they have been in position for about a YEAR. We have seen directors that frankly speaking, do not know what conservation is as well. While we do not expect them to possess deep technical knowledge, it is disturbing that they don\u2019t even understand the bigger picture or what their team is doing. BY THE WAY, your staff knows when you are fluffing. We say nothing because we don\u2019t want to get fired. Just know that is incredibly frustrating because it makes us wonder \u2013 why on earth are you paid at this level when you can\u2019t deliver? Educate yourself and stop wasting our time and the organisation\u2019s money. \r\n\r\nI can go on and on but I am exhausted. We all are, which is why we are all leaving one by one. Good luck to all who enter, I do not wish this place on my worst enemy."}], [{"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Fantastic Organisation to work at!", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 5 years", "job_date": "20 Aug 2021", "job_title": "Senior Manager%2C Fundraising in Tanglin Hill,", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Staff centric working environment that does amazing work to save the planet\u2019s environment.", "cons": "I honestly cannot think of any."}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 0, "Diversity and Inclusion": 0, "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 0, "review_title": "Rating", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "20 Sept 2021", "job_title": "Specialist in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Colleagues are nice and friendly", "cons": "Management level is messy.\nSilo structure"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": 3, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 0, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Underpaid", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 8 years", "job_date": "22 Mar 2021", "job_title": "Director of Operations in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible with global mobility opportunity", "cons": "Long hours and limited career growth"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Coordinator", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "18 Sept 2019", "job_title": " in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Working with passionate people all over the world\nSome industry experts to learn from\nNGO mindset and environment", "cons": "Everyone is too busy with ones own work, collaboration is challenging \nBureaucratic \nInstability of the work due to lack of funding at times\nSome strong egos around playing turf war and power games"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Neutral", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 4, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Global Payments and Data Strategy \u2013 Implementation Lead", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, less than 1 year", "job_date": "6 Mar 2015", "job_title": "Global Payments and Data Strategy \u2013 Implementation Lead in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Earth Hour.
