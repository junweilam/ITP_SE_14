Disclaimer: Not all PCF centres may be like this.\r\n\r\n- Principals and senior teachers view CCTV everyday to pick on every single thing.\r\n- Principal speak with sarcasm towards their teachers, and even personal attack. \r\n- Too much focus on unnecessary things like wearing of uniform (you will be asked to go home to change even if your uniform is not yet dry from washing), tying up of hair (only can tie bun or full ponytail), hair cannot even be dyed light brown (not even bright at all), only can wear black formal pants.\r\n- Centre does not replace toys/materials that are spoilt, only have 4 tricycles when you have more than 10 children in a class lol.\r\n- Big centre with low budget (hire external company cleaners but they do nothing much. Bulk of the cleaning come from the teachers such as rinsing toilets, cleaning pillars, wash toys, clean shelves & shoe racks, sweep and mop) The senior teachers will go around classroom to swipe their fingers against furniture to check if it is dust-free. \r\n- Centre is like a flower vase, look pretty on the outside but empty on the inside. Teachers there are all either physically or mentally tired. \r\n- There are a total of 3 principals taking different levels, and all 3 of them are unable to work cooperatively. Making it difficult for teachers working under them (different rules, different sop, different working hours, different celebration dates which often leads to parent's questioning if they have siblings in different levels) \r\n\r\nThe teachers there are all cooperative and have great teamwork. However, the principals in the centre are horrible. They make your life a living h*ll when you are serving your notice period. There is a high turnover rate in that centre.

Even though they don't explicitly say it, you are in the social service sector. And therefore, majority of parents' expectations are not that high - which translates into a lesser burden of keeping them updated on the child's progress. You may have alot of free play into deciding how things are run in your classroom as the principal may be too busy with her admin work to check on you. You finish work latest at 5.30pm. The company will organise alot of workshops / learning journeys for you to attend and upgrade your skills for free. Each centre has allocated funds to spend on learning resources. If thing gets too old and tattered, its highly possible to purchase a new one, instead of making a DIY replacement due to budget constraints. Facilities are continually upgraded and so you need not fear having things breaking down.", "cons": "Very disorganised and clueless about employee satisfaction, motivation, and retention. \r\nThe working environment for a kindergarten teacher very much depends on the centre's principal and the existing teachers. If they are veterans, you're in good hands. If not (which is not uncommon with the high turnover rates), then you would have to survive on your own as everybody else has their own problems to deal with. There isn't much mentoring / coaching available unless you seek it out and manage to find someone to help you along. Because kindergartens have 2 sessions - morning and afternoon, and each session having 18 to 20 children, you might have to spend time after your last dismissal (after 5.30pm?) to prepare for the next day. Apart from Nursery children, K1 and K2 classes may not have an assistant teacher around. So you need to be able to have solid classroom management skills if you got 20 children under your care. Because the central curriculum isn't perfect, there may need to be alterations to it. and every alteration needs to be recorded in a lesson plan, weekly plan, scheme of work, term plan. So, if you are good in creating and drafting out plans, its a breeze for you. If not, this is a pain point for many existing and new teachers alike. Teachers are required to participate in community events after work hours like festivals and celebrations, and most of the time, prepping the children for some show for the public. Unless you love performance art, this puts an additional strain on your part. When term starts, there is a rush to things to be done. Its hard (but not impossible) to cater for differentiated learning, because the goal of the organisation is for quantity teaching, not quality teaching."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 3, "Culture & Values": 3, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 3, "review_title": "KN Teacher", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "1 May 2016", "job_title": "KN Teacher in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Wonderful colleagues, cute children and good working environment.", "cons": "Low salary increase, demanding parents, \r\nNo dental benefit to part-time staff.
