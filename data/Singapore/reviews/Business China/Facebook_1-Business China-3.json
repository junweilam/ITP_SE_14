Business China is such an amazing place!!! If you are good at curry favour, this is the perfect platform to shine! \r\n\r\n2. Many opportunities to get into close contact with politicians, businessmen, but it all depends on your department and your direct boss, who might just cut off all your connections and simply make you do all the hard work.\r\n\r\n3. Office building is new, although all the furnitures are old, with the exception of those in top management office.\r\n\r\n4. Supervisors who are even more concern about you than your parents. They get anxious once you ain\u2019t in their bird eye view and you will receive text from them asking \u201cwhere are you?\u201d. Such love and concern, isn\u2019t?", "cons": "1. Not for people who want to do real work, since the management have no directions or leadership skills required to run the organization.\r\n\r\n2. Change of top management almost every two years, so even if you are great at bootlicking, it will reset to zero every two to three years. \r\n\r\n3. Company tends to scout highly paid yet incapable mid-management, who loves to take credit for their subordinates\u2019 work. When anything goes wrong, it\u2019s all the minions\u2019 fault. \r\n\r\n4. Pay is below market rate for junior staffs, with minimal increments. Income gap between junior staffs and management is enormous. \r\n\r\n5. Promotion purely based on favoritism. Apparently non-deserving staffs get the most recognition. If you show that you OT very often (even if you come in at 10am and do nothing during working hours), but just because you OT it\u2019s considered going the extra miles!! So remember to check your emails every night till 12am, you will definitely be seen as someone very proactive! \r\n\r\n6. A very toxic culture, with office politics even more exciting than our TVB HK drama. \r\n\r\n7. Definitely a training ground for Star Awards - leading actress/actor including one that bangs the table, another that accuse cleaner of stealing stuff etc"}]]
