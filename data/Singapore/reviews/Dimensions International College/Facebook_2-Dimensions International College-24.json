She can nicely teach other colleague stuff why don\u2019t she do the same to me? instead of sound annoyed when i just nicely asked her stuff that i unsure with? i dont understand her alot of things. I dont even know why her position is high when her English was just meh, dont even know the English meaning and dont even know how to do hand-on stuff etc. Her position high because she know how to wipe boss shoes?The way she handle stuff i really cannot take it..such as asked me to call maintenance to comedown urgently (eg; today must comedown to check) when the maintenance already told that they got tight schedule, cant allow many workers to work, only can limited to 2 pax due to government law of covid 19 situation but she insist must today, always use \u201cboss\u201d words to threaten them. Whenever company send quotation she always said in mandarin  \u201cwah, so expensive\u201d then might as well renovation the school since the school is so old and everything spoiled or broked then won\u2019t keep on ask the maintenance to comedown and change if it expensive. The company that i called is the one that they always asked them to comedown to fix the stuff and the quotation that they give is expensive then she secretly find another company that cheaper than the company that i called to comedown and check when i dont even know until i asked them then i know i being treated like a fool to her and more like hire me for errands when everything she did in secret and i just blindly follow and do without i know or telling me-.- always asked me to ask them stupid question like if it the thing 100% wont spoil again or wont happen again? And always go for ask to fix for free of charge -.- my end shift is 6pm but she always make me stay for 30mins just for any reason that she give me when she can end work later than me, i doubt she know that there\u2019s no ot pay that why she purposely make me do things when she can just do herself since she like to do it in secretly? Even like my last day of work, she purposely doing what zoom call? Meeting? At around 6pm plus? She can just print the paper earlier for me to sign but hey no! She purposely make me wait her for more than 30 mins when i end my shift at 6pm. I guess that\u2019s why hire then quit policy."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 5, "Compensation and Benefits": 5, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Great Company, Good benifits", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "29 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Customer Service in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Great Benefits for a SME", "cons": "Always in rush, can have better planning"}, {"Recommended": "No", "CEO Approval": "Neutral", "Business Outlook": "Bad", "Work/Life Balance": 0, "Culture & Values": 1, "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": 0, "Compensation and Benefits": 3, "Senior Management": 1, "review_title": "Not the worst school in Singapore", "rating": "2.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 10 years", "job_date": "14 Mar 2019", "job_title": "Senior Lecturer in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "The salary is reasonable and raises are rare.", "cons": "Management changes have made it difficult for teachers to communicate their views and problems.
