Don't get a car, it is absurdly expensive. Paperwork can be tedious and frustrating due to their inexplicable love for acronyms. But as with other advance Asian nations, things move smoothly once everything is set. Taxation is very low, but do pay attention to what is written between the lines (read good guides).

Beware.", "cons": "In the early days there were generous housing subsidies which is essential for an expensive city like Singapore. Then the policy makers decided to return to subsidies back to NUS books by allowing staff to stay at a discounted rate in their staff housing, with the shortfall to be paid from the grant of their bosses. Overall, this greatly reduced the attractiveness of NUS as an employer (whose idea was it to build those fancy apartments in the first place?). Research wise, it was one of the better places in Asia to work in. However, there was a chronic lack of a clear career path for non-PI's, especially for international staff, that really dampen my NUS experience."}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Neutral",
