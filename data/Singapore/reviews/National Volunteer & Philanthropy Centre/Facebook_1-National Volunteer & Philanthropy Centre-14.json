During my time there, I experienced poor work management, favoritism, low KPI targets, uneven workload, and bad people management. Work Management The work management in the IT department was very poor. The director would often side with her favorite staffs, even when they were clearly in the wrong. This created a lot of resentment among the other staff, and made it difficult to get anything done. KPI Targets Some staffs KPI targets were very low, which meant that staff could slack off all year and still meet their targets. This needs to be seriously reviewed Workload The workload was unevenly distributed, with some staff having very little to do, while others were constantly overworked. This created a lot of tension between staff, and made it difficult to get any work done. People Management The people management in the IT department was very poor. The director was often dismissive of staff, and she would often make flip-flop decisions. This made it very difficult to work effectively, and led to a lot of staff turnover. Conclusion I would not recommend working in the IT department of NVPC Digital Innovation Dept. The work management is poor, there is favoritism, the KPI targets are low, the workload is unevenly distributed, and the people management is poor. Recommendations I would recommend that the director of the IT department take the following steps to improve the work environment: Be objective Balanced KPI targets amount the staffs Distribute the workload more evenly. Improve her people management skills. Make decisions more consistently. I believe that these changes would make the IT department a more pleasant and productive place to work."}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Senior executive", "rating": "3.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee", "job_date": "17 Jan 2023", "job_title": "Senior Executive in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Central location Open working env", "cons": "Keep changing direction every year"}, {"Recommended": "N/A", "CEO Approval": "N/A", "Business Outlook": "N/A", "Work/Life Balance": "N/A", "Culture & Values": "N/A", "Diversity and Inclusion": "N/A", "Career Opportunities": "N/A", "Compensation and Benefits": "N/A", "Senior Management": "N/A", "review_title": "Good place to intern", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Current Employee", "job_date": "14 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Intern in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Flexible schedule, nice people who are willing to teach you", "cons": "structure is too complicated, less than average pay"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 4, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 5, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 4, "Senior Management": 5, "review_title": "Finance Associate", "rating": "4.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 1 year", "job_date": "3 Aug 2022", "job_title": "Finance Associate in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Decent pay for NPO\r\nGood Staff Welfare", "cons": "Stretch thin due to heavy workload\r\nHigh turnover"}, {"Recommended": "Yes", "CEO Approval": "Yes", "Business Outlook": "Good", "Work/Life Balance": 5, "Culture & Values": 5, "Diversity and Inclusion": 4, "Career Opportunities": 3, "Compensation and Benefits": 1, "Senior Management": 4, "review_title": "Better than Expected", "rating": "5.0", "reviewer_affiliation": "Former Employee, more than 3 years", "job_date": "17 May 2022", "job_title": "Department Head in Singapore", "duration": "N/A", "pros": "Good people who are passionate about creating A City of Good.
