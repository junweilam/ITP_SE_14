The management team has a shallow understanding of what they are doing and has regressed to issues explored over 4 yrs ago, without actually reviewing or valuing past findings and experiences. The environment is toxic because elements are now clambering to claim credit for things they have not done or lay blame on other people.\r\n\r\nOrganisational memory has been lost, forgetting what strategic partner entities have been contributing out of goodwill in the past and blind to the real value of what partner entities can contribute in the future.\r\n\r\nManagement has been so bad that, all their mid-level executional managers have left in the last 6 months, and close to half of their on the ground staff have left and more are in the process of looking to leave. New management has only been in place officially for less than 6 months. But hey it may be a strategy to get rid of \"old blood\" right? Or just plain simple mismanagement. Many people who work at *SCAPE are not there for the money, salary is pretty low, so for them to throw in the towel, it says alot about what they are putting up with.\r\n\r\n*SCAPE now chases after shallow wayang KPIs and media sexy stuff, which is scary for a government supported and directed entity. Instead of looking deeper and dealing with the real issues that affect youths in Singapore, which it used to have a heart for, it now focuses on hitting \"KPIs\" which help them look good to the various government agencies and personas they report to. Examples would include:\r\n\r\n1. Measuring youth engagement by counting social media likes, or incentivising people to fill out forms, so they have have numbers to show the brass. They are already aware of better ways to do this and should know real engagement comes from tracking loyalty, which they might be worried to expose to the brass.\r\n\r\n2.
