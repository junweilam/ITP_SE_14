The interview went alright and they were interested to know about yourself and your work experience. What was upsetting is that HR called me up and verbally offered me the position after I completed the interview a week ago.  However there were no followups after 2 weeks since HR last called me. I contacted them and asked for the updates but to my dismay the job offer was retracted since I did not have past experience in community healthcare. Then why give the candidate false hope and not seek approval from the rest of the management before informing the candidate of the job offer? Very unprofessional and distasteful.

I was not impressed that they weren't transparent about what I would be tested on and what it would be measuring.  That was red flag number one.

I wasn't impressed with her overall tone.  I feel I answered the questions well but the interviewers were the ones who let me down with their ""secret test"" and rude tone.   I did get called back for a second round with three people as well.  One of the interviewers after having listened to all my answers finally had a question for me which was :  ""Do you have any children?""

"Pros   time lapse between each recruitment round is rather short (13 weeks) process is efficient   HR contacts applicants throughout the entire process by phone which shows sincerity   Cons   too many round in the recruitment process and the duration for each round is way too long (last 2 round were around 24h each)   too traditional of a recruitment system especially with the physical psychometric round being packed with so many activities.   4 rounds in the recruitment process (physical HR interview online IQ test physical psychometric test final tea session with senior management). Took around 2 months in total from initial interview to final offer. Was told that there were around 180 applicants in 2023.   Note that HR prefers to contact applicants via phone (i.e. calling) rather than through email.   First round / physical HR interview  typical screening by HR comprehensive discussion surrounding your resume. HR seemed very tired (probably depends on the timing of your interview) and wanted straighttothepoint answers. Things like ""tell me about this project you did..."" or ""share more about this internship experience you have..."".   If you have progressed to the next round it might take around 2 weeks to hear back.   Second round / online IQ test  this test was sprang on the applicants suddenly because HR said that the next round proceeding the first interview would only be a physical psychometric assessment. Hence applicants only had 12 days to complete the IQ test. However more than enough time was provided in terms of the test's time limit and the it mainly consisted of numerical questions.   Third round / physical psychometric assessment  mindblogging and strange assessment that seems a bit traditional. Consisted of group case study (tied to university context) role play (literally) individual case presentation. Was one of the most tiring physical assessment I had done. Most of the staff present looked very angry and sad (maybe because of the timing of the sessions) but the mood livened up during the roleplay activity.  Due to the nature and intensity of the physical assessment tasks one might expect that the compensation would be quite high because of the rigour that NTU seemingly requires of their management associates. Disclaimer is that the physical assessment round lasted for 4 hours.  During these activities you would be able to tell that the staff typically face challenges of:   unlimited tasks but limited time   expectation from management surpass actual capabilities   frequent negative feedback from customers (aka students)   a few more but I forgot about them already   Final round / physical tea session with senior management  consisted of 4 sections in a room. Each section had around 810 chairs arranged in a circle (no table in between). A few chairs taken up by candidates the other chairs were occupied by the senior management.  Senior management included individuals such as the Csuite director etc. There were around 1620 senior management present. They split into 4 groups to sit with different sections. After around 20 mins the time would be up and the senior management would rotate to a different section.   Questions typically included ""why do you want to join NTU?"" ""do you know that you can't make a lot of money at NTU so why do you choose us?"" ""where else have you applied?"" ""compared to NTU the places that you applied are bigger companies so how do you choose among them?"" ""where do you see yourself in 510 years time?"". Honestly a lot of the questions made it seem like there is no future at NTU.... Also each group of senior management asked almost the exact same thing so you just have to pretend to be a broken record that day.   Another thing that disappointed me greatly was when it was the candidates' turn to ask questions some senior management were flabbergasted that they were being ""interviewed"". But isn't recruitment a 2way street these days? In the end left this session feeling extremely drained.   Offer was given around 23 weeks after the final round.",0.99736834,0.0024710752,0.00016056576

HR forgot to send interview link until I called to remind her half an hour before the interview. Interviewers appeared bored (i.e. one of them was resting his head on his hand and using his computer during the interview) and they didn't even ask me the first question. I have to selfinitiate to share about myself and past work experience. Overall the process was quite awkward as there was not much interaction between the interviewers (i.e. one of the interviewers has to call the colleague who is staring at the computer to answer my question after an awkward silence). Interview process only lasted ten minutes.  Suggestions: If a candidate has already been chosen for the position or you no longer have interest in a candidate it would be better if you called up the interviewee to inform on the latest changes as interviewee will usually spend time to prepare for interviews.,0.99797255,0.0018983587,0.00012902301

The position I interviewed for was actually Senior Executive but because I am a diploma holder I was offered for Executive position instead.  The first interview was great as I was referred by my friend. There are total of 3 interviewers 1 faculty 1 senior assistant manager and 1 HR.

I interviewed with the Division of Chemistry and Biological Chemistry at NTU. Had to talk about one's past and present research as well as proposed future research plans. During the interview my impression was that the search committee had been hurriedly put together as the committee chair who was apparently leading the interview was surprisingly unfamiliar with the format that was given to me. Also it appeared to me that the Singaporean core in this division/dept was very weak.

Two rounds one with the prof (more technical) one with a postdoc (less technical). The overall process was pretty easy one was online and one interview was in person.

Was called down for the interview about 2  3 days after the application. Interview questions were not too tough and the interviewers were quite detailed on their explanation.

The window between first and second interview was 5 months apart and reason they gave was HR lapse. Interview by the director and a professor. Waited for about 20 minutes before got called in to the meeting room.

I applied via taleo (online portal) and received an interview invite a week after. I was informed thru email that the interview process would entail a 1 hour written test followed by an hour long interview with the managers and director.  The written test is timed. It was done on a laptop presumably to access excel competency. Also there were several essay questions to complete (which were relevant to the job scope). After that it was meeting with the panel of interviewers. Interviewers were quite friendly and the questions asked are quite typical. It felt more like a conversation than a questionanswer session while preserving a professional and formal setting. Just do your part be prepared and besides putting your best foot forward and hoping for the best it's wise to use it as an opportunity to gauge how compatible your prospective employers with your work style and expectations as well. Overall a good experience for me as I find that no interview experience is ever gone to waste. It has been 2 weeks postinterview and I have not heard from them so I am assuming that there is currently no offer although the impression I was left with was that I would have been selected. A final point to note is that the type of interview structure would vary depending on which school/office you are interviewing with.,0.00451617,0.9744263,0.02105753

Emailed my CV to potential professor(PI) and got response within the same day to answer some questions about my background. Then the prof arranged a facetoface interview in the office (which could also be done by Skype).  The interview process was in a very relaxed atmosphere. The focus was on my past working experience and projects. So try to make it clear about what you have done in the past and prepare 12 project in more details e.g. what was the project what technology in the project could be transferred to the new project in future. And also there were some general questions such as why do you want to work in Singapore and why do you want to work in the university. At the end of the interview I was asked to provide 2 referees to send my reference letters.  After the prof received my reference letters I was asked to do a small project to demonstrate my expertise in the field and of course the project was not to difficult and was related and similar to the future work. So please do not be afraid of that. Just believe in yourself.  When I finished that small project the prof and I met again in the office discussed the details about that work. And I got an immediate offer orally by the end of the day followed by HR process and paper work. However the HR process was extremely time consuming and I waited 3 month for the official offer letter by the university in which the salary was fixed and there was no negotiation.

 Panel interview includes hiring team (3 pax)  1 HR  I've attended many interviews for corporate roles in the private sector but I was stunned and appalled beyond words with the behavior of the hiring team.

Nit pick about the typo i made in the application form  While it was my turn to speak one of them look like he is physically there but mentally not there. maybe cos he looks antique and should have retired long ago.  another hiring manager put up his arms at the back of his head and dozed off  The only one seems genuinely interested in the interview process is the HR manager.  One of the worst and most unprofessional interviews I have attended.

RecruitFirst had headhunted me and submitted my application for the job. NUHS contacted me 3 weeks later for a job interview.

"If you were recruited by a recruitment agency the recruiter helps you prepare for the interview by prefacing you with what to expect. A written and timed assigment (1 hour) with about 5 questions and then 2 interviews. Questions like ""How do you see the healthcare sector in Singapore?"" (Yes in that kind of grammar) ""What are your goals in life?"" First interview with an HR member and the reporting manager. Second with the Head of Dept. After the assignments and interviews the recruiter gathers feedback from you which is how they have info to prepare candidates. The HR team takes long to give you an offer and finalise things. After the interview they inform you that you are selected but take one week to decide and inform you your salary without a contract. And only upon your acceptance will they prepare the contract which takes another week. This is inefficient. They give you one day to respond to their salary offer which is unprofessional and insufficient.",0.99844223,0.001399331,0.00015846906

Time taken to get back to me after the first round was long (23 weeks) and they require you to bring so many paper documents (it's 2019; please save paper and go digital like everyone else is doing). Interview itself was rather standard although during the first round they told me AFTER the whole interview that the job is actually a 2year contract (no mention of it in the job posting or anything prior). Felt that it went quite well after my second and final round but after that HR did not even get back to me with the rejection/outcome which I felt was quite unprofessional.

Interview process was relatively easy.  During interview: HR clearly did not do her research. When she asked what’s my current salary  I mention XXX and she said something along the lines that it’s so much. She said that in a face to face panel interview with other interviewers. Lol. She is interviewing someone fresh out of Big 4 audit where the salary is pretty transparent and the general consensus is it’s below market because the turnover is expected to be high in Big 4. Her comment just shows her lack of knowledge in the field where she is expected to have information. (I got minimum 20% pay rise in all my job offers FYI) Postinterview: After I rejected the offer she kept trying to persuade me to accept but her persuasion techniques is terrible. When I rejected she retorted “but you apply for it”.  I said if I apply to 10 companies must I accept 10 job offers? Not sure if she is living in a cave  candidates have options not just companies. An adequate HR personnel should try to market their company to you since you have already successfully market your skills to them.  She also called me multiple times on various days thereafter to persuade me to accept the offer. That’s the perfect way to tell me the job is so unattractive that nobody wants it that you have to keep calling me. You know that right?

The interview phenomenon was smooth and took around 1 hour. However  there was no response after the interview. It is considered highly unprofessional for a top rank university toward an academic position. It is understandable for an admin position but I feel rude for not informing an academician of the outcome until I wrote them an email after two months of no news despite the fact that an email was sent to them within an hour after the interview.,0.9928986,0.0069063497,0.00019501342

I applied for the position and heard back 3 days later. I had to complete some tasks (fairly easy  just summarizing a literature review and some Excel work) to be done in a week. 2 days after the submission of my tasks they informed me of my interview which took place shortly after.  The interview was with 5 people and it went really smoothly. I enjoyed it and the research fellows and assistants were engaging and interested in what I had to say so that gave me a great impression of the team. I went into the interview rather apprehensive about the job scope but after a great interview I became even more excited for the role.

Worst interview experience. 2 interviewers in the panel. From the very beginning even before the session started both of them already sounded uninterested. Throughout the session they had a monotonous tone and were extremely rude and unpleasant. While answering questions they would find whatever ways to rebut your responses and even doubt your abilities by responding in a sarcastic manner. Honestly makes me wonder if this is an interview or an interrogation. You would think an institution like this would have decent interviewers but I guess I thought wrong.  Perhaps the institution should consider accessing staffs before they can be qualified to be an interviewer cause not everyone is cut out to be one.  Even had the basic courtesy to email them after the interview to thank them for the opportunity but received no response. Overall VERY unprofessional.,0.99838495,0.0014543296,0.00016066153

I interviewed with the Department of Chemistry at NUS. This consisted of research talk (public) a proposal defence (closed door) and many 1on1 meetings with faculty members. A few of the faculty members were extremely rude during the 1on1s e.g.  cuts you off midsentence asks you questions and then not letting you finish your response before interrupting unsolicited sarcastic remarks and a generally hostile demeanour.

The initial part of the application process was OK. The interview took about 1.5 months to come but to be fair I applied quite early in the application cycle. The interview went well and I was told they would get back to me with further steps. And then radio silence.  For almost 3 months.  Every time I emailed them to inquire on the progress of my application they would say that they were still processing the application and that they would get back to me when they have news.  They wouldn't give me a timeline as to when they would get back to me either.   After 3 months the semester started and I figured they weren't going to give me the job so I accepted another job offer. But the lack of courtesy to tell candidates that they weren't under consideration even when they checked in via email was extremely unprofessional.

"It comes in 2 stages  an interview and then a written assignment on a computer. The interview was done by 2 snobbish women that made me want to stand up and leave in the middle of their interview which is something I would have done if it happened now because I've decided to stop tolerating rude interviewers. (I'm writing this review belatedly.) they asked many irrelevant questions that were completely outside of work and qualifications. They picked up on part of my resume that mentioned my volunteering experience at dog shelters and one of the women said ""but dogs can be noisy right?"" with some disgusting expression on her face. They were the ones that asked me about it so why ask about something you clearly hate and think is beneath your species? I replied ""they're cute so it doesn't matter"" and she looked as if she was jealous of a dog. The other woman was no better. Asked about my previous company like they have some preoccupation about the past and when I answered what I didn't like about it (they didn't properly guide newcomers) she said ""they never hold your hand?"" dripping with sarcasm as if my reply could possibly be wrong when it is literally an opinion question she asked. And there is a clear difference between common sense to guide newbies and handholding. Again if you don't want an answer then don't ask. You can also clearly see her attitude towards her job and newcomers in the way she thinks that newcomers should know how to do everything by themselves and that the old staff need not do anything at all which is absolutely nonsensical.",0.99740076,0.002412169,0.00018718623

I did not get to meet the PI in 2 interviews but met about 4 of the postdocs and had a little lab tour upon requests.

"There are two rounds of interview. The first one is a phone interview and the second is a facetoface interview.  For the phone interview the professor required me to call him at a stipulated time. When I called him he picked up on first ring so it came across he remembered but just did not want to call. I take it as poor interview etiquette and to mean he is not reachable unless by appointment if you become his staff.   Throughout the interview he was speaking meanly in a very nice way. He was asking for first authorship kind of work from me and asked about technical questions different from those used in his area of work and in his advertisement. He also asked whether I could write papers for grants which I came to understand it is his job scope as a professor.   When I mentioned I did not have some of those I don't have (I knew about 70% of what he asked already) he went ""Oh the kinds of job you had usually had your name on the publications last. People like you are good at analyzing things but had so much difficulty writing papers.""   To be reasonable he is paying less than S$3000 for this RA position and he is demanding intellectual work which is more likely his job scope.Then he should have asked for first authorships in his job criteria.  After I hanged up I felt that he probably saw me a waste of time so he asked me to call him. Well I have attended interviews in other universities to know things work in a better humane sense.  He even commented how people from other industries came to his interview and he did not want to see those people. Hence the phone interview. Well to be fair the job market is getting very bad for job seekers. People just want to put food on their tables. For him as a junior ranked professor to make such comments to stranger interviewees it's very unkind of him.",0.9824744,0.017148258,0.00037735578

The whole interview took about 30 minutes and only 2 questions were asked by the interviewers. The interviewers were generally nice and willing to answer the questions. However HR had promised to get back to me within 3 weeks no matter the outcome but it has been more than 4 weeks and they still have not gotten back to me. Followed up twice but no replies also.

I applied online and a Zoom interview was scheduled within slightly over a week. I was interviewed by two of the PIs and one HR.  The doctors were polite friendly and tothepoint and very forthcoming with details about the job scope. The questions asked were quite standard (tell us more about yourself what are your career goals are you more taskoriented or peopleoriented describe a challenge you faced). They also asked about my research experience (what was your research about what lab techniques do you know) my experience with data analysis and if I had experience drawing blood.   I received the offer within a few days. HR was somewhat disorganised; 2 of them handled the offer and one of them called me multiple times lastminute to request for documents (some of which I'd already sent) and to arrange for my preemployment health check up. I also had to ask multiple times about my start date before I received an answer.,0.99248147,0.007278967,0.00023952869
Paperwork/ documents were fine and sent through email.  Interview was set up 1 week later after a phone call saying that I was shortlisted for a position in the blood bank laboratory (i applied to several of their openings within the company). Interview was through zoom and I had to wait 25minutes later than the stated scheduled timing because there was another candidate before me. This was infuriating and disrespectful to me because not only I've mentioned once but twice that I wasn't available at any other timing on the interview day (today) itself but the HR insisted that they could only do the interview today and no other days. Seriously? I understand that everyone has a busy schedule but one cannot expect all your potential interviewees to revolve their schedules according to your availability shouldn't there be some sort of agreed compromisation?  Not only I've sacrificed time and money (had to grab back home from work) just to attend the interview at their specific timing but they were late for 25 minutes. during interview: there were several interviewers2 to 4 of them. Noted the range? Yeah because 2 of them practically didn't show themselves but only their shoulders and half of their faces during the interview and still asked questions with no proper appearances. (wouldn't you feel further disrespected at this point?)  1 of them seem to be very annoyed when I expressed my interest in another (related) field other than the laboratory setting and yelled at me asking what I actually preferred. She just seemed genuinely pissed off when I shared my interest of areas (even though both areas are so closely related). And she didn't seem to be happy that I had another job interview (which had immediate acceptance) that was on hold for me which I've yet to accept because of this SGH interview. But now that the interview is over I would gladly accept the other offer that is waiting for me.  All in all there will always be that 1 sensitive and triggered interviewer in every interview so do prepare and brace yourself to meet such people.,0.9977641,0.0020719545,0.00016392341
"# Initial Application Applying for the job was an extremely longwinded and troublesome process.   First after submitting a CV with all my employment history and education history I was directed to fill in an online application. This was tediously long and required me to fill in the exact same details that were already on my CV. The online application took approximately 20 minutes.  After I was shortlisted a representative from HR contacted me and directed me to fill in ANOTHER form with the exact same details that were on my CV and which I had also entered into the 1st form.  After this was done a Zoom interview was set up for 2 weeks later.   # Interview The interview was held over Zoom and was done by the HR representative along with 2 other current lab techs from the Virology Lab (which was the lab with the job opening).  The interview lasted 45minutes although the Zoom call did cut off halfway in possibly due to it being a free Zoom call instead of the enterprise version. There were no issues with the interview process and the interviewers involved were friendly.  # Offer 2 weeks after the interview I received a call informing me that I had passed the interview and that they were intending to extend an offer of $3300 (I had initially asked for $3800).  I requested for a formal letter of offer which was flat out refused and instead I was informed that the details of the offer would be sent to me in an email. The offer details was sent rather unprofessionally with the details written in an HTML table within the message body of the email itself instead of a formal document letter of offer.  The email (which was sent at 2.30pm in the afternoon) requested that I give a favourable response ""by tomorrow"". I replied to request for a week to think it over and got a very discourteous response telling me that I had 3 days to make a decision.  # Negotiating the Salary I attempted to negotiate the initial offer of $3300  to $3500 and was informed quote ""as explained over the phone the degree start rate is harmonised across all Singapore public hospitals. We will not pay anything above our offer of $3300.""  This response is extremely rude and was shocking as it basically portrayed SGH as a toxic inflexible work environment that is simply not open to constructive discourse instead choosing to confront candidates with rude ultimatums as if trying to diminish a candidate's selfworth and bully the candidate into accepting.   Additionally this information about the degree start rate being fixed was news to me as this had not been ""mentioned over the phone"" as claimed. The only thing related that I was informed about was that the salary RANGES depended on the level of our degree. As any dictionary will show a range does not just have one fixed number.  The information that all public hospitals' degree start rate are ""harmonised"" seems to contradict crowdsourced pay information such as those from Glassdoor which leads one to question the exact motive behind putting forward such a logical fallacy without empirical evidence.  Ultimately the interview experience started out well but devolved into a bad experience that left a horrible impression of all public health services efficiency and mannerisms.",0.9976495,0.0021211982,0.00022927573
The interview was very straight forward. However... the process for HR was quite horrible. 2 HR handle the offer but they took a long time to do an offer package. Other HR kept asking to send things that already been sent many times. Overall. Quite horrible.  I've read reviews on HR from others below.. Whatever was said. Is absolutely true.

Interview process was rather ok with the standard questions. Interviewers were friendly but HR was a tad rude and kind of sabotaged the interview by mentioning that I had applied for other roles... Unfortunately Singhealth HR is generally inconsiderate in ensuring a positive candidate experience as they don't bother to reply to candidates postinterview followup emails nor provide a reason for rejection (I had applied and went for a few other interviews). Not surprisingly it was radio silence (even though the HR guaranteed that there would be a response in 2 weeks). 6 months later HR called asking if I was still interested. The moment I replied saying I had found another job the HR 'feedbacked' sarcastically as if it was my fault for not waiting for them to call and she had purposely KIVed my profile further explaining that it was now the right time since someone in the department had left. Who in the right mind would wait for 6 months for an offer? Unprofessional and inconsiderate indeed.,0.9937736,0.005982942,0.00024340663

1st and one round  With hiring managers and HR  Didn't have a good impression even before I attended interview. HR called and insisted I have to cancel all appointments to meet the interviewers three days after because one of them is a doctor and he insisted it.   The interview last for over two hours. (Note: This is a Research Coordinator position which I applied.) Everyone at the panel looked at the doctor adoringly when he spoke. Even if anyone of them wanted to talk about the job they looked at him and not me. This situation resembled the reviews given about existing staff in the hospital over here.

The doctor interviewed using coercive techniques when in doubt and refused to introduce himself too. The hours spent and the way he asked questions suggested to me he wanted a staff whom he could abuse any ways he wanted  that he might not be a good boss  and preferably you should be as poor as a church mouse so that you could take up his job and let him and his staff do whatever they want to you.,0.9981363,0.0017246542,0.0001390639

I was asked to go for the interview quite last minute and during the interview one of the interviewer seem amused by something all the time. Felt she’s really rude and insincere as even if she finds me unsuitable she should have the courtesy to act professional during an interview as I’ve take out time to dress up and attend the interview on time. The HR promised to get back to me in a week even if I’m not hired but I emailed and called them twice after 5working days and waited for another 3 working days and no answer. Not even professional courtesy to say I’m not hired. I strongly not recommend to even attend their interview as I believe it is s fake interview to just test out the job market or they are hiring someone that’s recommended by their colleagues or an Ex student. Felt they wasted my time and it’s very unprofessional not to even reply to a candidate to inform them they are not successful as they take precious time out to attend the interview.,0.9987972,0.0010365744,0.00016621102

Interview was done in such an abrupt manner which lacked professionalism.  It felt as though I was taking up the panel of interviewers' time and they were just bored/unkeen.

Senior manager seemed like she had not read my resume prior to the interview. Her attitude was cold and blunt throughout the interview.  The job posting online stated Admin Assistant with duties: student outreach duties campus tours and administrative duties. However the manager said that actually the main job is to conduct campus tours for new students throughout the year. She proceeded to ask me to say what do I think in my current job is relevant to this job position. When I explained my current and past job experiences which were mostly administrative and stated that I was very willing to learn with my limited experience in touring and student outreach  she shot me down with 'what made you apply this in the first place and why are you even here?'  She was very unpleasant throughout the interview and seemed ready to leave. One of the most unpleasant experiences I've had.,0.99450463,0.0053502396,0.00014510473

The interview required the completion of a mammoth performance task that mimics a task one might encounter in the actual job. If satisfied they would proceed with a twostage interview involved. The first stage would usually involve senior staff in the department subsequently in the second stage there would be more people involved (likely those whom you have to work with). Actual ability to perform is being assessed (especially first interview) followed by skills and culture fit (especially second interview). On reflection I think the difficulty lies with having to perform a skill without sufficient knowledge of the correct assumptions to make (which you would only know if you ALREADY work there). Chicken and egg issue? Hehe. But then I see where it comes from as well.,0.9677932,0.031906683,0.00030008794

I applied online. It took only 2 days to receive the first phone call from an admin manager instead of HR.  2. The admin manager helped to arrange a call with another 2 hiring managers as screening call.  3. After the phone screening I went down twice for interview  the first was to meet with the hiring managers and the other one was to meet with the Dean. The interivew was rather easy and they did not access much of my marketing skills.  However the interview process did not provide me a positive experience as the whole proces was not professionally handled. I would suggest getting a HR involved in the hiring process will be a solution to help with that. Firstly the hiring managers did not provide any updates until I followed up with the admin manager with emails. Secondly all the interviews were always arranged very last minute which is okay and I tried accomodating their schedule. But after the socalled last interview they did not even get back to me on the feedback as in the result of the interview. Well if a candidate invested so much time and effort into an interview an answer or feedback to the candidate is the least they need to provide.

"Everyone I encountered at SP seemed extremely confused and uncoordinated. Here's my little tale.  My first contact with SP was through email with someone from HR (let's call her Ms A). We arranged for the interview date and time after a few exchanges. It's quite strange that she never once did reveal her phone number nor did she call me.  All these ""toandfro"" could have been much shortened.  Days after I've got the interview arranged a different person from HR called me (let's call her Ms B) wanting to arrange for an interview! She seemed totally unaware that I already have one arranged by Ms A. I told her about this and she never called back.  Fast forwarding to the day of the interview I met up with a fulltime lecturer (let's call him Mr C). He was cordial and things seemed to go quite well. I had some questions about the level and depth of the course material I was supposed to teach and he agreed to send me the course synopsis. At the end of the interview he mentioned that he would put up a recommendation to his bosses for a second interview. The second interview would be where I would meet his bosses.  Days went by and I did not hear from Mr C.  Even more days went by and I heard from yet another HR staff  let's call her Ms D. She called me up wanting to arrange a first interview. I told her that I've met up with Mr C and wondered why she was arranging for one. She said something about Mr C's wish to arrange this interview. Had he forgotten that we've met?!  Ms D replied that she would check back with Mr C.  Then I did not hear any more from them.  I could overlook all these if my livelihood did not depend on this queer bunch. After all it was just a parttime position I applied for. But if you are considering working fulltime at SP it might be good to think twice.",0.9407657,0.058947396,0.0002869752

They wanted to check if I would be a good fit in the team. I was also asked to send a presentation detailing my work via email after the first round. I was called for the second round of interview (September) and this time I was interviewed by the main director and team lead. It ended on a positive note with the team lead congratulating me. I was asked to await a call from the HR. However I waited for a month and still did not get any call. I was following up once in a month with the team lead regarding the HR interview. He assured me via emails to wait patiently. This went on for three months and in January when I called the admin staff I was told that my application was rejected. When I called the team lead to confirm he told me that he was unaware of it. They did not even care to update me regarding the status until I inquired.

"I applied online through the government jobs portal and this was considered an entry level position.  I received a call for an interview the following week and when I went for the first interview it was amongst people in the department I was applying for. Initially they asked generic questions such as an introduction the kind of experience I had reasons I applied for the position and it progressed to situationbased questions to understand what I'd do in madeup situations relevant to the work they did. The first interview completed with questions regarding my proficiency using the Microsoft Office applications.  I was invited for a second interview and besides the two persons who interviewed me the first round the deputy principal and HR director were there and this session was a little intimidating for me but they were very nice and asked questions such as what I'd contribute to the polytechnic if I were hired. They gave me the opportunity to ask questions and I was concerned about the performance appraisal system and culture.  Aside from answering ""favourably"" to the questions they asked they took note of punctuality (I was vying for the position with 3 other shortlisted candidates who made it to 2nd round and was slated to go 2nd but I reached first and the rest reached after I was done) and what I brought to the interview (a drink was definitely not welcome).",0.43565506,0.56294507,0.0013998813

It was obvious that the interview was just a formality. They probably had already found a suitable candidate earlier but did not want to cancel mine which was unfair as they should assess all candidates 1st before making a decision.   1st the Head of the unit who was supposed to be there didnt turn up. Only 2 of his subordinates did.  2nd they didnt show interest in my resume at all. It was abvious they had not read it. They also asked obvious questions with answers that could have been found in my resume like 'Where did you work last and what did you do there?'.  With the lack of interest and preparation from and by the interviewers the interview understandably lasted only 10 mins which is the shortest interview I ever had.  This episode really shows the lack of integrity and sincerity of SUTD's decision makers. I spent more than a week preparing for it. Either cancel it or give me a fair chance!,0.99845445,0.001402712,0.00014282965

The interviewer highlighted right off the bat about my lack of experience which I thought was dodgy B.S.  fair enough the candidacy criteria requires some number of years (which wasn't mentioned in SUTD's job posting) but they could have filtered me after reading the CV and not waste my time. I had the dignity to call off the interview in the first 20 seconds and walked away.,0.4602156,0.5389562,0.0008282093

I recently had the pleasure of interviewing with them and I must say it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. From start to finish the interview was conducted professionally and efficiently with plenty of opportunities for us to get to know each other better. The interviewer was very welcoming and made me feel comfortable from the beginning. They took the time to introduce themselves and provided a brief overview of the company the position and the responsibilities involved. They also allowed me to introduce myself and ask any questions I had. During the interview I was impressed by how wellprepared the interviewer was. They asked thoughtful and relevant questions that allowed me to showcase my skills and experience. They also gave me a chance to elaborate on my responses and ask followup questions. Throughout the interview I appreciated the way the interviewer actively listened to my responses and provided valuable feedback. It was clear that they were genuinely interested in my experience and my fit for the position.

I applied for Deputy Manager position in Careers@Gov portal. After about 2 weeks later the hiring manager called me during lunch to describe the job to me and find out my interest. When I told him that I was interested he arranged a virtual interview 2 days later with himself and his department director. His director talked nonstop for an hour during the interview to describe the job to me in much detail. At the end of interview I indicated my interest. The same day itself the hiring manager called me at 6 pm to ask whether I am available to attempt a written assignment. I was required to write an essay (1 page or less) about what I know about the job after the interview and how I can contribute to make the project a success. The written assignment must be submitted within 3 hours. After that the final interview with HR neutral director and the hiring director was more than 2 weeks later. The final interview lasted slightly longer than an hour and questions asked were related to how I manage project and even details like personal interests and family members. A week after the final interview there was no news. I checked with the HR interviewer and was informed that they are still considering my application. Another week later I had 2 other offers to consider but I prefer this job the most. The HR interviewer again informed me that they have not come to a conclusion yet. Even up till today (more than 3 weeks later) there is still no news not even a rejection email which gives me the impression that they are so inefficient and indecisive. Seems like they only interview people for fun and take it like a chit chat session.,0.99289435,0.0069432827,0.00016244153

3 levels of interviews. Senior management carried a very unfriendly and elitist attitude . Entire experience gave a terrible impression on the conduct of a public servant.

I went for the group assessment after submitting my resume through jobstreet. The first part of the assessment was an individual assignment. Each person was given some time and materials to present on the topic. There were 2 assessors whom we presented to.   After the individual assessment we were asked to discuss our ideas as a group and come up with a group answers. After this group presentation we were asked questions by the interviewers.   The last section was a team game. To prepare for the assessment I think it would be good to understand about the industry/local healthcare scene.,0.0008419532,0.99873835,0.00041971766

Contract role offered by Recruit Express whilst I submitted an application there for an admin position.

One of the best interviews I've ever had was with WWFSingapore. From the first call I had with the HR until the interview with the hiring manager  every step of the hiring process was filled with respect. The questions asked by the two interviewees I had were relevant and carefully thought of. The interview felt more of a conversation because I was at my best self and there was no intimidation. I wish all other interviews were like that! I didn't get the job but I didn't feel bad at all because I was treated in a way that made me feel I mattered and my opinion counted. I was also given constructive feedback (through email) a few days after the interview. I didn't expect it because other companies would just ghost you if they didn't like you right? So thank you WWF for the wonderful interview experience!,0.0014733142,0.0026789538,0.9958477

Call with Swiss counterpart first. Then assignment and second interview with Singapore head of comms and line manager. Cronyism is strongly at play here  the Singapore head and manager are both of Indian nationality. Was told to come in and interview but got asked inane questions and my assignment wasn’t even reviewed. Didn’t get turned down but checked on LinkedIn to see another person of Indian nationality got the job. Was I the token Singaporean to fill the interview quota?,0.9941578,0.0056803715,0.0001618535
Fairly standard 1 hour long interview. Interviewer asked questions to survey work experience and tested me on the spot to pick my brain for ideas. The inexperienced HR executive who was part of the 2 person interview panel asked only 2 really basic questions throughout. They're impressed and told me they would get in touch with me but sad to say neither of them bothered to reply. In the end this job position closed and I found out that they took my ideas and launched them into a new content marketing direction. HORRIBLE BRAIN PICKERS.,0.9981096,0.0017382114,0.00015221254
