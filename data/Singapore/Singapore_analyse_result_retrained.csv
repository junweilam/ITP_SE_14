ASEF is a unique organisation and working for it is also a rather unique experience. Being apolitical but working with governments brings its own challenges as well as opportunities.  While bureaucracy is definitely there and could (as well as should) be diminished overall ASEF offers their employees a great level of liberty and responsibility to take ownership of the projects they run.  The team is small so each staff member has to step up in order for the organisation as a whole to continue evolving and improving (i.e. if you're just looking for any 95 job to put bread on the table without an actual interest in ASEF's vision and mission this is most probably not for you).  And yes you will most probably end up working a lot. But yes you will also be inspired and gratified by the work itself your colleagues your partners your participants and other stakeholders. Only you can assess if the significant efforts you will need to put in are worth your time and dedication. If you believe it is please give it a try.,0.023000939,0.9734721,0.003526871
Your experience at ASEF can be very different depending on in which department you work. None is better than the other each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. The collaboration between departments is not the strongest but you can yourself influence this if it's something that is important to you.  Unfortunately Asian and European governments are not giving ASEF or the ASEM Process sufficient support (political financial human resources etc.) which can lead to some challenges in relation to implementing projects. Expect hence having to come up with creative solutions to these and other challenges related to the characteristics of the organisation and its work.  While interpersonal conflicts have existed in the past the situation has improved the past couple of years. Such conflicts can come up again though at any time (and in any organisation/company) so it is also your responsibility to contribute (and avoid being counterproductive) to a healthy work environment if you get such an opportunity.,0.9762804,0.02349532,0.00022428411

IF YOU ARE  STAFF: idealistic and committed when you arrive prepare to be drowned by meaningless tasks as well as lastminute requests (taken for granted no personal boundaries). As admin work occupies most of your day you will dedicate plenty of extra hours to project work. CONSULTANT/VENDOR: prepare for 90's bureaucracy and processes. You can charge the highest rates as you are expected to solve a big organisational mess. PARTICIPANT: you will have a one time opportunity to network. It will take several months for ASEF to reimburse you. PARTNER: weak reporting system so you will barely know what ASEF does with your resources. If you earmark funds your logo will be present  that's all. Only interesting because of your countributions. FRIEND: all the privileges you ask for 0 responsibilities  HR rules don't apply to you. You don't need to do anything written in your fancy job description (just personal chauffeur or clapping pet).  SENIOR MANAGEMENT (PROFESSIONAL): power/drama hungry individuals that would be immediately fired anywhere else but here. SENIOR MANAGEMENT (APPOINTED): lack of professionalism or contact with reality. They look to another side when problems arise only interested in their personal agenda and future postings. IF YOU WANT  IMPACT especially in the long term RECOGNITION of good practices EMPOWERMENT as a worker (or just being listened) Please consider other job prospects as you will not find this here.

Green space behind the building where you can see the wild monkeys. Inside the building you can see the circus animals (pro tip: betterbehaved wildlife in the Singapore zoo) Some managers are moonlighting because they're bored. Actual work takes little time and there is no IT screening of computer use. So you can do whatever you want.  Office politics is easy to maneuver but so timeconsuming and superchildish:  1) nonseconded directors think they're the ones holding up the place and want to be congratulated for doing their job (so tell them how fantastic and hard working they are  exactly like Joan of Arc) seconded directors don't want to hear problems so send them on foreign travels away from actual work stuff. 2) There are camps which plot against against each other  (for no reason  maybe camp A person didnt go for lunch with camp B person)  join each camp and agree with everything. Then go do exactly what you want and blame it on other sides when they complain. 3) For promotion/bonus time: be visible and sing the praises of everyone in the management team. EVERY ONE. Since the discussions happen on a vote basis in closeddoor management meetings consensus on how many people like you is the basis (there is no rationale really since there is no understanding of professional performance management). You'll get a promotion if they like you not on your actual work performance.   Salaries are not transparent either; the pay scale they use is for optics only.... there is space to grow and you can earn a decent salary if you use the tips above (you're welcome!)   Come to ASEF and coast.,0.9977264,0.0020539637,0.00021964773
Where to start? During my time nepotism bullying and gossip was the order of the day. BY THE LEADERSHIP; most of the midlevel and junior staff are actually okay. Many of the unpaid interns were relatives/friends of kids of the directors; management hired friends to take on consultancies organisational budget spent on hosting wives' gatherings or beautifying offices. The most unprofessional of leaders (2016  2021) surrounded by the most sycophantic of advisors who traded morals and decency for permanent positions or pay rises or dubious promotions where people clearly unsuited for the role were moved to new positions overnight. For those who disagreed they were summarily dismissed. If anything goes wrong the lowest person in the food chain is blamed for the problem.  These issues of unprofessional behavior have always existed in ASEF (at varying levels of idiocy) and will probably always exist. Diplomats are accountable to their countries not to this organization so unless they already have good values there is no check on corruption and powerhungry egos. Many forget they're no longer running embassies. Some professional directors have been here for so long and in so many roles that they are unable to see how the world has left this outdated organisation behind; HBR articles aren't the best source of management unless you can reflect on how your own actions bring an organization down. There is a 0 accountability structure.   The new ED is doomed because by the time he can get support from his own advisors (and some of them will be actively plotting against him if he corrects their behavior) and gain consensus from 53 member board his posting will be over and a new diplomat from somewhere else will come in and do the same thing.   You'll learn new skills in people management but you'll give your mental health away.

ASEF offers a unique opportunity to work with multinational colleagues. We have currently have a staff strength of 35 employees from 19 nationalities in Asia and Europe. It's a diverse and enjoyable mix albeit reminiscent of a big dysfunctional family because of different backgrounds mindsets and cultures.  ASEF also offers excellent networking opportunities with international partners and counterparts. For people with a nongovernmental background it offers exposure to diplomacy especially if one's role involves dealing with the Board and various Asian and European ministries.  In preCOVID times ASEF was best placed to offer travel opportunities to its staff in implementing projects across the 2 continents. In 2018 I travelled to 9 countries. Work then was exhausting yet exhilarating and I believed in the impact of our projects that brought Asians and Europeans together for cultural and intellectual exchange.   The good things end there and these positive aspects are not worth enduring the negatives ones (read cons),0.0012333998,0.0066876193,0.99207896
"The problem with ASEF is that it seems to reset itself to Zero every 4 years when the top management changes which is a total mess if I may be blunt.  Our leadership are seconded highlevel diplomats. This means that while they may have the best of intentions to effect positive change they are not necessarily the trained professionals needed in managing a uniquely structured and everevolving nonprofit. They need strategic and operational help but alas they are surrounded by incompetent people in their immediate support team.  This combined with 7 heads of departments with conflicting interests results in a circus. Internal procedures are a mess rules are nonexistent and lobbying for selfpreservation is abound.   The worst part is that the staff in the Managerial level and below (Executives and Officers) suffer because of the mess on top. Work load is increased unnecessarily. So much time is spent pushing paper.   On top of that there is no appreciation for staff apart from nice words of validation and empty and broken promises for positive organisational change and career progression. There is no growth in this place it's just fighting fire every single day. Further the overperformers are not only expected but demanded to make up for the shortcomings of those who do not pull their weight. This results in burnout overall dissatisfaction and a loss of morale since the performance appraisal system is a big joke and underperforming staff are protected for optics and a socalled healthy head count.   Senior management encourages people to ""grow"" and learn other skills/other roles within the organisation but when one shifts from programme management to operations to fill a gap it is not recognised as a significant contribution  actually it becomes detriment for the rewards/promotions/salary increments because the programme people are valued more than the people who make their programmes happen.   There is a lot of overtime in ASEF and this is not compensated. Mental wellbeing of people suffer too. The current senior management has open doors and staff do approach them with grievances but there is zero action to remedy various problems.   Because of all this drama if you are are looking for a normal 96 job with acceptable work/life balance forget this place. If you are looking to be compensated for your worth forget this place. If you despise admin work run far far away. Any role in ASEF is approx 80% admin/pushing paper around.",0.998108,0.0016626171,0.00022942005

"Management has changed and the work environment is now toxic. The management team has a shallow understanding of what they are doing and has regressed to issues explored over 4 yrs ago without actually reviewing or valuing past findings and experiences. The environment is toxic because elements are now clambering to claim credit for things they have not done or lay blame on other people.  Organisational memory has been lost forgetting what strategic partner entities have been contributing out of goodwill in the past and blind to the real value of what partner entities can contribute in the future.  Management has been so bad that all their midlevel executional managers have left in the last 6 months and close to half of their on the ground staff have left and more are in the process of looking to leave. New management has only been in place officially for less than 6 months. But hey it may be a strategy to get rid of ""old blood"" right? Or just plain simple mismanagement. Many people who work at SCAPE are not there for the money salary is pretty low so for them to throw in the towel it says alot about what they are putting up with.  SCAPE now chases after shallow wayang KPIs and media sexy stuff which is scary for a government supported and directed entity. Instead of looking deeper and dealing with the real issues that affect youths in Singapore which it used to have a heart for it now focuses on hitting ""KPIs"" which help them look good to the various government agencies and personas they report to. Examples would include:  1. Measuring youth engagement by counting social media likes or incentivising people to fill out forms so they have have numbers to show the brass. They are already aware of better ways to do this and should know real engagement comes from tracking loyalty which they might be worried to expose to the brass.  2. There is a shallow drive to pull in ""sexy"" topics like A.I. robots and vending machine retail concepts just because it looks and sounds good at this point in time. There is no deeper thought to how this integrates back to youth outreach engagement and capability building.",0.9918663,0.0077274065,0.00040623173

No longer a beacon of education in language teaching and teacher training. Sh upper management and a school now run by sales and marketing rather than an academic team. Teachers told to give feedback as nothng more than a boxticking exercise. No one heeds any input from teachers or Senior Academic Staff. More interested in bums on seats even if those seats are filled with highly disruptive dysfunctional SEN students who should not be given a place. Even midmanagement is willing to sacrifice the 10 other students' right to a calm focused learning environment if it means keeping the money paid by the uberSEN's parents. 'Kids won't really complain about it will they ? We only see them once a week' think management. Disgusting. Furthermore the organization has been eviscerated from within by poor management decisions and bullshittery involving cookiecutter approach to centres across the globe.

1. Not for people who want to do real work since the management have no directions or leadership skills required to run the organization.  2. Change of top management almost every two years so even if you are great at bootlicking it will reset to zero every two to three years.   3. Company tends to scout highly paid yet incapable midmanagement who loves to take credit for their subordinates’ work. When anything goes wrong it’s all the minions’ fault.   4. Pay is below market rate for junior staffs with minimal increments. Income gap between junior staffs and management is enormous.   5. Promotion purely based on favoritism. Apparently nondeserving staffs get the most recognition. If you show that you OT very often (even if you come in at 10am and do nothing during working hours) but just because you OT it’s considered going the extra miles!!

Although a new DG and Board Chair are starting their tenures and both seem committed to addressing the many serious issues left behind by the departing DG the corrosive inept egodriven senior leadership team remains in place.  Over the past month (since the DG left) Senior Leadership have been making increasingly reckless selfserving organisationharming decisions some in direct conflict with the IB's own financial safeguards and internal policies. Management of the serious issues around exams during the time of COVID remains wellintentioned but tenuous with far too much depending upon the good will of dedicated overworked midlevel and junior staff. Programme integrity is seriously threatened as is the organisation's reputation; these threats will grow even greater should things proceed as they have ben going.  While there is every hope that the organisation will turn around under the incoming leadership unless the remaining members of the senior leadership team are investigated and removed or reprimanded for their long individual and collective histories of poor decision making policy breaking bullying and in one very unfortunate case harassment the IB will remain a bad place to work.,0.9978728,0.0019424664,0.00018479035

Unappreciated by management. Often they find fault in staff rather than the system. More often is they side more to doctors than nurses.

"INEPT MANAGEMENT  Management/ Aministration live in their world; they don't listen. I complained about the conduct of some MOs and attitude of some nurses but there was no action.  Management/ Aministration sit in their observatory high tower; they don't care. They dismissed feedback about compensation and benefits and work/ life balance from ""ground"" staff.  Management/ Aministration are wont to capitulate to unreasonable patients; they are spineless. They shoot first and ask later. They don't understand that many patients are plainly unreasonable (typical peasantry mentality) and in the wrong. It's disgusting that they always concede to patients' unreasonable demands even when patients are plainly in the wrong.  INEPT NURSES  Nurses are brainless lazy complain a lot and always follow the wrong instructions. They can do one task wrongly over and over again. When impeached they will point fingers at their MOs and then each other and give excuses. Actually I can do everything myself; thanks but I don't need their trouble. But I have no time.  Some nurses always disappear for hours to smoke and chat. Sometimes they even bring along their managers from the same country!  I wonder if Nursing deserves a degree course in NUS when the job needs only ITE caliber (the most miserable level of certification in Singapore). And yet they can mess up so often.

I worked here in 2016 thinking that with my experience and communication skills from working in NHS hospitals  I would be able to bring something to the department. However I have never been more unhappy felt less valued and more alien in a team than at Changi.   The senior staff were closed minded and couldn’t seem to step away from any protocols that existed to take in ideas from the international staff or anybody else for that matter. Common sense in this hospital is very uncommon and all clinical reasoning goes out of the window... if it’s not part of the protocol then “can not”.   The manual handling techniques were dangerous and I couldn’t understand how more staff didn’t injure their backs in the process as no equipment was ever used.   The more established staff were more interested in saving face than supporting their junior staff and on more than one occasion I was wrongly blamed for errors of my “senior” staff.   The communication within the team was poor notably the team I worked in were unapproachable and actually harvested an environment that meant that asking questions was avoided at all costs as you were made to feel stupid for this a terribly  dangerous situation  for patients to be in  and an environment that stunts all staff learning opportunities.   The case load expected of staff including junior staff was extremely high and language barriers were not taken in to account.   There are many more negative points to working here but I don’t have the inclination to waste anymore time talking about this hospital as it was the worst nine months of my life. I knew many expats who also worked in my team and they mostly hated it.,0.998755,0.0010907406,0.0001542659

You have a lot of autonomy in your work.  Supervisors are very understanding and sympathetic of family crisis.  There is a sense of family. Work environment is great.  The nature of the Christian work itself is very fulfilling if you are looking at something to do with people and simply evangelistic work.  Being part of a huge global missions organisation the global exposure is rich and opportunities to work crossculturally is limitless.

There is an overall lack of tenacity to fulfil important organisation goals. If you come from the private or public sector be prepared for a lot of frustration when you experience a culture that accepts ambiguity and contradiction.   You will realise that work meetings tend to drag very long because of their unsaid belief in consensual leadership. If any leaders were to give a directive the culture is such that there will be a lot of negativity towards leadership and the leadership feels compelled to attend to each individual or if frustrated say something that invites more controversy to force a buyin. If you are coming in as a middle management and above be very prepared for a longdrawn battles. The voices of the younger generation of staff (millenials) and the oldest generation of staff will be the loudest.   Lastly certain departments are very overworked: campus department (due to lack of manpower) missions department (due to the launch of many missions projects) and HR department (due to lack of proper HRtrained personnel to handle the work). If you are going to work in these three departments be prepared. Due to work load and long hours the staff members in these 3 departments fall sick very often.,0.9981804,0.0016717259,0.00014793767

 Nepotism and favoritism. It's a family business. If you're not related please do not join. There are so many incompetent people in position.  No bonus benefits appreciation or whatsoever for staff.

This is a family business and everyone in the top management are related. Culture is the school is very bad and there is no trust from the top management to all their staffs. Micromanagement is rampant in this school.   First year of employment only have 10 days of leave.  If you pass your probation before Chinese New Year you'll be forced to clear 5 to 7 days of leave during this period. If not you must take 10 days of No Pay Leave.  During school holidays we are forced to clear leave. If we have not enough leave we must take No Pay Leave. There are a lot of teachers (especially IGCSE and Primary school teachers) who only survive with half month of pay every year during June and December holiday. During normal school days when you have free period you may be forced to take leave.   Cross deployment of teachers within the various campuses ever though it is not allowed. Those who took grab or taxi will be reimbursed but those who drive their own car will not be reimbursed.  School sack staffs at whim. It is very common to see someone today and the next day they are gone. No appreciation to staffs.   HR will turn nasty once you decided to leave the place. Some staffs were threatened to sign an agreement to forfeit their pay when they were asked to leave immediately. The school also threatened to withhold the final salary of some teachers even though it is against the law.   School will ask teachers to be strict with students but once the student complain they will side the students and reprimand or even sack the teachers.   No 13th month bonus or end of year bonus or any bonuses.,0.9989465,0.00089285366,0.00016068522

Literally nothing. The staff in the admin dept are all newcomers. There is literally no one you can turn to for help. The only senior staff in the dept can’t handle stress.

I was most shocked and flabbergasted when they taught me how to alter and edit documents for the sake of audit. This is a school  an education facility for goodness sake. How can you teach stuff like this ?? Totally not moral. Btw they will whistle blow to higher management if they want you out of the campus but have no reasonable reason to do so.   This staff abhors mingling between colleagues (whether that is between or within depts). She LOVES to micromanage and violate your personal life as well. She wanted to check a staff’s personal phone as the staff did not reply to her messages AFTER WORKING HOURS mind you…  Working in the admin dept your job scope is ONLY documentation and filling for students (all the way back to 2019). Even if you request for alternative tasks they will not give it to you. As they will criticize and have concluded you as someone who can’t even do the simplest thing – so what makes you capable of doing other tasks.  After working there for a week I can see that they totally DO NOT bother to try to consistently update and maintain their records. Instead they pressured the new parttimers to finish it. And if the parttimers did not reach the target they will shame you in front of other colleagues. It is genuinely hard to hit the target as they are so inconsistent that you have to constantly do corrections for the same file multiple times (which is so demotivating and depressing).,0.99861264,0.0012241111,0.00016320359

How i wish i can give them a zero star... think twice before you apply this job for “Admin and Operation” at Kovan Campus. Here are my long stories of why i quit this job. So most of them are from Malaysia ... and I swear all those high positions really don’t know any single of things i asked them question it like i better asked a 3 years kidz they probably will know. Easy money without doing anything. ok never mind...when i first came in one of them was being so rude and said in mandarin  “i dont care just tell them to wait there” when i nicely asked her question. Next another malaysia (I dont know what her actual position in) also damm biases impatient and rude! She can nicely teach other colleague stuff why don’t she do the same to me? instead of sound annoyed when i just nicely asked her stuff that i unsure with? i dont understand her alot of things. I dont even know why her position is high when her English was just meh dont even know the English meaning and dont even know how to do handon stuff etc. Her position high because she know how to wipe boss shoes?The way she handle stuff i really cannot take it..such as asked me to call maintenance to comedown urgently (eg; today must comedown to check) when the maintenance already told that they got tight schedule cant allow many workers to work only can limited to 2 pax due to government law of covid 19 situation but she insist must today always use “boss” words to threaten them. Whenever company send quotation she always said in mandarin  “wah so expensive” then might as well renovation the school since the school is so old and everything spoiled or broked then won’t keep on ask the maintenance to comedown and change if it expensive. The company that i called is the one that they always asked them to comedown to fix the stuff and the quotation that they give is expensive then she secretly find another company that cheaper than the company that i called to comedown and check when i dont even know until i asked them then i know i being treated like a fool to her and more like hire me for errands when everything she did in secret and i just blindly follow and do without i know or telling me. always asked me to ask them stupid question like if it the thing 100% wont spoil again or wont happen again? And always go for ask to fix for free of charge . my end shift is 6pm but she always make me stay for 30mins just for any reason that she give me when she can end work later than me i doubt she know that there’s no ot pay that why she purposely make me do things when she can just do herself since she like to do it in secretly? Even like my last day of work she purposely doing what zoom call? Meeting? At around 6pm plus? She can just print the paper earlier for me to sign but hey no! She purposely make me wait her for more than 30 mins when i end my shift at 6pm. I guess that’s why hire then quit policy.,0.9982114,0.0016422914,0.00014639852

Flexible working hours for me although this is similar in the UK/Aus as well. This is also highly dependent on the PI. If you have a Singaporean PI be prepared to work like a slave. People are mostly friendly and are helpful but some people (PIs) have their nose up the sky when they walk and don’t say thanks when someone else opens the door on the way in/out.,0.0031703543,0.9962244,0.00060520746
Career There is no career progression in place and they mostly hire from outside to fill their “faculty PI position” which is really outdated US system that promotes toxic competition. Research fellows are not allowed to apply for their own funding again becuz they are not “PI”. So what’s the point of doing a PhD or a research fellow at DukeNUS then if you are not allowed to get your own funding cosupervise or supervise your own students at official capacity and contribute to the uni and society all of which are what research fellows should be exposed to as soon as they finish their PhD. Research environment Not very collaborative compared to some of other research centres I have worked in the UK/Aus. Common lab equipment not maintained very well lab spaces are not maintained very well. Paints coming off the wall mould spots on the ceiling tiles no air pressure gauge on the wall damaged spots everywhere on the lab vinyl floor. This is not that bad on Level 7 but shockingly bad on level 9 Emerging infectious diseases program. The building has dodgy and slow good lifts and there are not enough (and badly designed) office spaces) which means some people are sitting/drinking in the lab with flipflops. This is due to the fact that there is a giant hole in the middle of the building silly/lazy design really. Not enough conference rooms and quiet rooms and really bad AV infrastructure in these rooms with projectors and HDMI working less than half of the times and are not ZOOMcapable thus screen sharing on halfass HDMIprojectors. I find that the program retreat that I went (apparently this is compulsory) was a giant waste of a day. I saw PIs stroking each others ego all day long food provided was ok coffee served was horrendous. I instead went to Coffee Academic for a real cup of espresso. HR Slow as turtles. found a RAs through interview but this RA found an another job whilst waiting for DukeNUS HR and contract UNBELIEVABLE. Others DukeNUS is located in SGH and is too far away from everything else. MRT/bus is on the outskirt of SGH and no underground pass/shops from MRT into SGH either what a planning eh. There is no decent cafeteria and food places around. Walking under the SG sun and humidity midday for lunch is just not pleasant at all.

Seminars used to be conducted frequently if you're interested in keeping up to date with research or keep an eye out for potential collaborators these are excellent opportunities.   21 days of annual leave seem to be generous as compared to the industry.

"HR is a huge problem. Ironically the department is unprofessional to say the least other than not being productive or responsive. Whistle blowers within DukeNUS don't get protected information gets leaked to the miscreant and the bullying gets worse. Under a professional setting all the highly unacceptable behaviours are getting brushed under the rug as ""lab mismanagement"" unless you are being physically or sexually assaulted. Anything leading up to but short of that will be filed under mismanagement and you may very well lose your employment because you stood up for yourself.   Gifting is not a common practice but as there are no strict rules regarding this it has been observed that people who frequently provide gifts seem to escape any form of repercussion from being unprofessional.   There are no guidelines on promotion you could be in the same lab for 10 years and remain as an ordinary RA or RF or your direct supervisor could be your friend outside of work and you'll get promoted within a year.   Publication is an issue as well whoever gets the PI's ear will get dips on half completed work just to finish off some tail end bits to acheieve a first author paper. Your RAs get hijacked by the very same people. It's a dog eat dog environment.  Lab safetey is an issue with this much neglegience going on people leaving mice carcess in the fume hood liquid nitrogen tanks not shut properly 4 degree room door getting jammed (users having difficulty getting out of the room).

Safety regulations are strict lab equipments are mostly well maintained. The building is maintained very well always in tip top cleanliness even before covid. There appears to be good staff interest activities from time to time. Working hours are flexible. There is a good opportunity for learning if your schedule allows for attendance in seminars. (This is based only on one lab which I'd worked in) Despite the hierarchy most postdocs encourage RAs to participate in project discussions and generally value our skillset. RAs are generally get the opportunity to work independently. The inhouse supply store is rather well stocked. There is a good culture of helping one another out among labs irregardless of being in different departments.,0.00023909476,0.00039289115,0.999368
(This is based only on one lab which I'd worked in) There are quite a handful of members who really require anger management therapy or psychiatric help.   Postdoc with aggressive behaviour and temper outbursts often malign others often misconstrue ongoings in the lab to the PI. The lab had lost several outstanding postdocs and RAs because of these malicious sabotages and project stealing. PI had failed to protect lab members and made a poor judgement call to promote someone who clearly lacks maturity leadership qualities and emotional/mental stability.   Lab members generally remain silent after verbal and emotional abuse in fear of retribution from the perpetrator who will worsen the bullying.  A lot of inappropriate and highly unprofessional behaviours had been observed over the years. Most common observation throughout the past years are ostracism temper tantrums extreme favouritism emotional manipulation through gifting and poaching RAs they have befriended from other labs. HR's mismanagement in overlooking repeated offence could partly be due to personal friendship with perpetrator. There is no safe channel for staff to express their distress. There are also members who smash objects in the lab or slam doors or objects around the building (though to clarify never at people). Whistleblowing policy covers a wide range of unacceptable misconducts including mismanagement of funds falsifying data and physical abuse. Unless you are ready to record all of your time spent in the lab to gather evidence of abuse you won’t be taken seriously.   The salary is not enticing and the finance department is not efficient in reimbursing claims.,0.99874496,0.001106849,0.00014810082

The management don't treat you as equal you are just a tool to make things done. To make things worse they had the wrong idea about data science plus they have their Finance ego which they think they are awesome. This combination makes working so hard you won't get recognized doing the right thing or you need to spend lots of time persuade them to accept the right way.   Based on this your work won't easily get recognized to the extend you. The management just don't respect your craft to the extend you.   They had big plans but they don't recognize the scale of the project hence no proper resource planning time planning. You end up doing things alone in a tight schedule to meet ridiculous deadline you need to make sacrifice and compromise and in the end you won't get recognized.   If you see a problem and wants to do something about it such as build something to facilitate future work you also won't get recognized and will be treated as useless. The management don't have the vision.   Even the pay is good you as a data scientist you won't improve your skill very much you gradually lose touch with what is going on out there.   It is a small company but the hierarchy is not necessarily tall. Everyone and everything is run by CEO himself and the management are voice pipes. This makes things very slow.   Career wise there is no 1on1 session between your boss or if there is it will be useless as your boss doesn't know anything about your skill. There is also no career progression as well.   Work life balance well during working hours your time and energy is wasted on dealing with useless matters they also expect to see the result so you need to work on your own time to delivery then explain your work to them later.,0.9986172,0.0012069253,0.00017589016

The immature and incompetent management in Singapore believe they are a top school in AsiaPacific. Apart from a couple of good Profs the teaching and research is abysmal.

They expect full commitment for a low salary. The direct supervisor comes in several times a day and requests spontaneous meetings or alternatively blows off meetings that one has prepared for. Trust in employees' capabilities is low. Criticism rate is high even when they are genuinely satisfied.

Divisions such as IT is favoured rather than equal fairness.  INSEAD cuts off the salaries saying it cause of the covid impact. Got to know that a few confirmed news that some of those IT colleagues get salary increments some reported that its more than 10% increments position upgrades dispute to the difficult scenarios in which the school is going on.  So why school is treating differently for each department? so salary cuts initiated to pay our hard earning money on their increments and promotions?  this is a very disappointing situation in the Singapore campus where it led us to lose faith as some favours are been catered to rather than fairness.  We heard that the IT division gets more benefits than other divisions too. they are allowed to work from anywhere. most of the employees were flown to their homes and work from those countries while getting the payment from Singapore where other divisions have to be in Singapore and there are no such arrangments made,0.9984133,0.0014388171,0.00014779532

Most of the employees are not happy with the newly appointed managers in IT.  Seems that the new managers are not capable of managing the colleagues who work under them. they are overusing the power political agendas  to crush the people who are managing  by them.   IT is became highly political driven. have seen some of the employees are getting benefits growth and some are getting penalised and don't let to grow only cause of the politics. seems this is happening with the newly appointed managers who are trying to bring the people who supports him by removing the people who are talented. recent appointments  by those managers are clearly shows that and a good example would be employees who are recently leaving the company. those managers are narrating the story which everyone believes the reasons.  but the truth we have seen is those are talented people and they left cause of those managers' politics. anyways thanks to those managers the team spirits team collaborations team energy team contributions are far away gone.   The best part is top positions of IT  are with closed eyes.  Only hope is CIO will consider and  stop those  ground level politics which managers do for those employees.  as an employee its really sad to see that this place was a great place to work and now its became a ground of hell with those political agendas and process.,0.99627435,0.003474871,0.00025079842
 I'm lucky to work with in a department where managers are communicative treat staff with respect and lead from the front. It reflects the wider organisational culture of collegiality transparency and diversity. It's paying dividends now as staff are banding together during this crisis to do whatever is needed for the school to get through this in the best shape possible.   Compensation is competitive and comes with excellent medical insurance coverage and decent amount of vacation leave.  INSEAD is a nonprofit organisation  any surplus is channelled back to the school and staff are rewarded with bonuses.

I had several years of  experience with IT industry before i joined here. but after joining here i have experienced the worst scenarios in my entire career journey. this place is one hell of a politics playground.  the IT is driven not by technology but with so much politics. the time i have spent here i saw how wrong people are promoted assigned for not desired positions only because of the politics . most of management positions are filled with nondesirable people specially no humanity factor at all ( new appointments). About the salary  Scales are too lower than the industry.they pitch that its non profit organization. IT industry is one of the core department in School and they have budgets for change the carpets not paying salaries? This place giving even lower than the industries lowest margin. They keep the salary scale just above the pass approval rate only. this is the second reason i have left this place. So if u coming here expect that you salary will not increase even if you work here for 34 years. Whatever you talk they don't increase. Check with other companies what are the salary scale if you want to join here.   Overall from those managers heads are playing politics like boss. They don't care about the wellbeing of lower levels. As i have seen when i was there most of skilled experienced valuable employees are leaving this company only cause of those reasons.,0.9990038,0.00084137626,0.00015483101

"Not sure if the management are humans or snakes. They would not let you air your views if you do air your views be prepared to be handed a ""performance improvement plan"". Even if you have been following the CPE guidelines they will argue that you are wrong and will not listen to your reasons.   Each department works on destroying and tearing down each other. They are constantly finding little loopholes to twist and turn stories in order to get you into trouble. Especially AASP.   Marketing & recruiting department is willing to lie to students just to get them in like telling them that they can go overseas during the school term when classes are ongoing etc.   ANY student who can bring them the money will get admitted. Most of them cannot properly form sentences and yet they can graduate from the school. Not to say that they only prefer one particular race. Even among staffs one of the manager mentioned they would rather that race because they can speak chinese.   HR? Is there even a HR department? Because whenever there is any feedback there is no action plan or any actions even taken.  Student Affairs are run by incompetant people who are not grounded and who constantly gatekeep information.   Overall they do not care about their staffs higher management is just getting the money sitting on their ivory tower and will talk about values to be followed but they themselves do not even practice it.

"Management consistently has contradictory expectations  ever changing as long as it is beneficial for whatever narrative they are trying to put across at that time. E.g. management got away with hiding a staff's Covid case from the rest of the department to ""avoid panic"" but conveniently reprimanded another staff for not reporting a student's Covid case in time when no clear instructions/ protocol was implemented.  There is a bias towards hiring of Chinese Nationals as management are also PRCs. There is little to no chance of a minority being promoted in this specific department.  Student first approach is regarded as law if students neglect their own responsibilities (payment enrolment maintaining a valid student pass) staff are considered to be at fault for not doing their ""due diligence"".  Training for new staff is minimal figuring out the bulk of what to do requires consulting with fellow colleagues.  Job scope is not fixed it changes according whatever new expectations management has. Current trend is an increase in responsibilities over time without compensation nor promotion.  Turnover rate is very high will be expected to temporarily take over any resigning staff's portfolio once they consider you to be an experienced (6months  1 year) staff even if you are struggling to cope with your own portfolio.  Notice period is a minimum of 2 months. The HR department loyal to the the higherups do not bother with attempting to report any issues.",0.99807113,0.0017539811,0.0001748718

As mentioned in another review she also kept a Covid case from the rest of the staff to avoid panic with no consideration for the fact that many of the staff were still living with elderly parents. When a colleague brought up the fact that one of her students was self harming she said ""eew why are our students like that"".

Given how bad some of the reviews are on here I think it's time someone spoke up for the Singapore campus.

Supervisors previously from SIA (as flight attendants) lacking exposure in the society; hence questionable ways in managing their subordinates. They are not on the ground to help their subordinates during crunch times. Instead of helping they criticized them for having their break time after working their sweat out during crunch times. Supervisors lacking empathy skill and act hypocritically in front of their subordinates which could be a norm in their previous workplace. Unfair performance evaluation for the obvious fact that the supervisors are not on the ground to witness job performance and rely solely on one source for the feedback. Do not expect that you will be doing patient care service or community work as the main job duties are helping the nurses doing tasks that do not need nursing training such as diaper changing bathing/sponging ambulation of the patients. Credit goes to the nursing team because most patients view Patient Care Officers as nurses.

"I was in my first year of working at KTPH and was caught in a cross fire between the laboratory management wanting to reduce hiring Filipinos due to the effect of foreign hires and the lowering compensation for medical technologist/nurses in the hospitals.   I was discriminated against by Filipino managers as a local newbie that one of the Filipino lady manager even sexually harassed me on an occasion.   There was also a peer that did not like my accent (her words not mine) and constantly brought it up. Sounding this to HR only got the response of ""Just find another job"". It has been a number of years since this happened and I since left (less than a year tenure there). The experience is still so bizarre and I wish it on no one.

"To start things off this company is full of politics which I only got to know after a month of joining. You will hear things of senior management who are biased towards favourite employees and things like someone backstabbing just to get themselves promoted.  Next is the superior I worked with. Very micromanaged selfish and expect staff to work after work hours. If this is not you please think twice before joining. Personally I believe in worklife balance.  Next be prepared to face some bigheaded students. Some of the students here don't know how to respect us as staff. This is maybe because the management ""worships"" these students and look up to them as stakeholders. Nothing wrong with this but some students might have gone overboard with this term.  Lastly the location itself is not convenient for me. This is case to case. I live in the East hence my journey to work can take more than an hour. And take note the campus is not very near to the MRT station.",0.9983,0.0015356774,0.00016430607

1. Poor career prospects since management are caught up in politics backbiting and selfinterests. The fastest way to get promoted depends on which political party you are in.  2. Lack of handover and training for new staff. 3. Check out the poor Google reviews about school. 4. Communication from the ground to the management achieves nothing much. Feedback is not valued or appreciated. 5. Long probation period. After probation pay increment is little not even matching monthly transportation allowance. 6. Lack of manpower support and outdated IT equipment. 7. Old facilities for students. 8. Quality control of lecturers aren't there. Do not expect professionalism.  9. PEI audit will be problematic since high turnover rates for the past few years.  10. MDIS College is a deregistered PEI since 01.09.2021. 11. Can be assigned extra work that is not within your job scope. Do not expect pay renumeration to match for the extra workload. 12. Needs extra time outside working hours to clear work. 13. Too many internal platforms to learn the systems and information overload juggling work.  13. Unrealistic KPIs that are copied and pasted from past year. 14. Workflow between departments not streamlined. 15. Will need to carry company phone even though office and school emails are provided. Personal information of contact shown on school website. Personal confidentiality needs be released to public for the school's gains.  16. Needs travel a distance to get outside food during lunch.  17. Pantry facilities are almost nonexistent with the exception for the CEO floor that has the fancy stuff. 18. School website information does not coincide with Quality Assurance standards. 19. School needs biometric system for daily clockin and out working hours. The system timing is inaccurate. 20. Heard school's location lease will be soon up in a few years. Unstable environment to work in if it is not permitted to stay on but shift elsewhere. Don't know if it is for real. Better do your own research. 21.

No relevant training provided. Always maintain the stance of learning on the go.  Inflexible HR policy as when you are late even though you compensate accordingly it becomes a demerit point. Resulting in deduction of pay.  You are given a letter of concern when you exceeded 5 days of MC. HR is unable to answered when query if there is another alternative. This will result in your increment to be lower or not at all.  Bonuses are always being delayed citing poor performance by institute. Only receive it before the week before CNY.  A lot of Council members have invested interests in the institute. When performances are bad no discount offered to institute for service rendered. Whatever is earned in the institute it is indirectly transferred to the members. always saying that they are working on volunteering basis. How adapt.  In order to be promoted you need to have the necessary paper qualification. However for long tenure staffs they are being promoted for well staying longer than others.  Salaries offered to fresh graduates are below market rate.  Products which are not competitive are expected to fly off the shelf by the management.  When academic quality is compromise nothing was really done as they cannot offer competitive salary to attack talent. Hearing management say that they cared only for the student it really makes you wonder.,0.99898523,0.00086936157,0.000145381

My goal here is to share what I learned and hopefully prevent you from a career regret:  Incompetent Managers / Management They are usually clueless about the nature of our work and very often the staff have to bear the brunt of their wrong decisions and their support for the wrong person.  I can accept if decisions are established out of pure stupidity but many are made out of favoritism or they are made for selfish reasons – outcomes which put them in a good light with the council. Need I even mention that my Senior Manager thought Gandhi was the Elephant God Ganesha? And he cannot differentiate between ‘angle’ and ‘angel’?   Old School Marketing Strategies.  We were often told to think out of the box but they were never open to new ideas and suggestions; often fearing a backlash. Some of their “good marketing tactics”:  1) Distribution of flyers with the whole department (yes the WHOLE department) printed inhouse  2) Going around the school and forcing students to ‘like’ the school’s FB page 3) Nonstop orders of foods for unnecessary events  4) Printing 2K mailers and franking every one of them singlehandedly (yes the WHOLE department is involved again)  Throughout my stint with them I was made to do so many marketing fails that made me seriously doubt my intellectual level. And what was my reward? A Senior Director had the cheek to tell me that she did not know how to appraise me as my “job scope was not defined and objective enough.”   Boiled Frog Syndrome The boiling frog is an anecdote which describes a frog slowly being boiled alive. Complacency at its best with boiled frogs galore in MDIS – I know of many staff who are unhappy with their jobs and the management but these people ironically just remain unhappy without putting enough effort to improve the situation they are in.,0.99461114,0.0050285626,0.00036027902

NTU research staff typically offer a decent base salary scheme.   Flat hierarchy system allow most teams to gain flexiblity to work from home  even during the postpandemic period.

Overwhelmed majority of the postgrad research staff are foreign talents. HR is mostly females. If you are a Singaporean male it may be awkward and embarrassing to take a 1 week NS leave for your annual reservist commitment as chances are you are properly the only Singaporean male with NS commitment in the team.  The bonus scheme is vague and almost nonexistence. Therefore the net remuneration package is often less attractive than other research institutions or what you can achieve among the western counterparts. E.g: 13months bonus provided by the company has bizarre rules such as New hires on their first year are not entitled 13 month bonus or any prorated among from date of joining,0.99888915,0.0009571997,0.00015363484

No clear leadership from top Townhall used to blow own trumpet and is Mushroom Management 6. IT systems are outdated and CITS leadership do not really know how to improve but only to change to offtheshelf systems (but these are unable to fit the organisation's goals) 6.

 Working environment and overall satisfaction really depends on the PI you're working with. Some are way more amicable than others and there's no good overall philosophy of work/life balance across different schools.   I'm very skeptical of the possibilities of becoming a senior project officer. Seems most PI's take it as a very short term job and there's really little appreciation for the experience you might bring. If your plan is to jump into a PhD or research fellow position then this is no issue but if not keep in mind that this position has little to no possibility for growth and significant salary increase.,0.99790204,0.0018663142,0.0002316064

Although the following is specific to my case...I feel this to be generally true.. (1) Can work at own time no timing restrictions (usually)  (2) Can work in the own interest  area (usually) (3) Medical Benefits are good (3) Great infrastructure overall (4) Research Funding usually quite good. (5) Great food joint all around Campus,0.00042792992,0.004101656,0.9954704
This is also specific to my case...feel free to draw advice from it as needed. (1) Quality of Research Supervision is pathetic (2) Research Supervisors lack proper industry exposure (3) Teaching/Communication ability for a lot of them is quite challenged (4) Basically you get paid to publish pretty much on your own !! (5) Salaries are low !! (6) Due to limited funding budget Job is always contract bound !!  In summary...Quality of Professional life is only as good as your current supervisor...This should be the most important criteria while taking up this Job..SO better be sure about expectations from Day 1...Better to even ask potential supervisor how much he/she expect you to publish.   From NTU side all things are pretty ok and well sorted out.. !!,0.9972391,0.0025728329,0.00018804365

Salary is way below industry average. As a university whose claim to fame is that their graduates earning big bucks they don't give fresh grads who join them the same kind of  recognition.  Increment is pathetic (less than 3%) Little progression A lot of SOPs (Standard Operating Policies) are disregarded when people of higher power want to have their way. My own management somehow give in to these people even though the SOPs are cast in stone by Ministry of Finance. It can be a power struggle in there.  Little freedom to express your views to implement changes to improve processes. Management manages teams via what they see on spreadsheets with little knowledge of what's really going on the ground.  I would strongly recommend fresh grads (even if you are from NTU and love the Uni) against joining NTU as frustration will kick in pretty quickly.

Unprofessional bias unreasonable lack ethical moral lack professional management skills tend to take sides of their own people and especially people who share the same religious like them. Lack integrity like to spin up story so as to make themselves look good on the basis of twisting the fact and making what is not correct into right by rallying their supporters to support their wrong view and twisting of the truth. Do not have the background to do the job but still pretend they are the most qualified individual to do the role and besides dealing every day behaving like they are the boss of the company in their unreasonable and twisting belief and that being their subordinate is like their slave.   Twisting of facts and rallying their own people to support them on the fact that they are wrong but make it appear like as though they are right and the other party is wrong.  Usually get support by buying group or individual lunch.  Utterly disgusting and toxin behaviours that is exactly how in history the rich treat the poor. It is a shame that such character still exists in today's era and affecting a public university's reputation.,0.99807775,0.0017267816,0.00019543013
Flexible working hours a lot of freedom to do what I wanted (due to the PI of my project being very open and genuinely nice).   If you're lucky you may get a chance to work on an industry funded project and potentially be a patent author for the intellectual property coming out of your project.  Energetic and multicultural environment as a large number of people are undergraduate/master's students from different countries around the world.

Most of the research projects end up as paper publications and go nowhere in terms of commercialization.  Severely Limited career progression for nonPhD holders (and even for PhD holders).

Once you know cons its upto you to decide.   NTU got ranks because of the facilities and the infrastructure.   Professors are just a typical mangers/administrators rather than researchers (who sit with the students and discuss about the work). Instead  they just want to write proposal and get money and recruit someone to assign that project.  Deliverable from the project doesn't have to be great as most of the funds are from the govt (tax payers money).   Dealing with lab assistants is a real pain in the ...... .    If you are going to do just some simulations or inside office you can rock.  Less interaction with industry   Masters course: you dont have to do a project (just complete 10 courses within min of 1 year) .,0.9957468,0.0040420345,0.0002112
NTU is one of the highly reputed and competitive universities with high QS world ranking. They provide good enough scholarship to pursue PhD with all the research facilities and good funding and collaboration.  NTU is also daily improvising on its infrastructures to make it one of the highly equiped accesible well maintained and beautiful campus. Sooner or later having a tag with NTU might boost up your profile.,0.00065316603,0.0021894958,0.99715734
Despite many pros NTU has a bad reputation of focusing on quantity than quality when it comes to publishing research works. This comes from the pressure and strict deadlines for competing tenurships and politics. Even though the stipend for PhDs is good enough compared to the rest of the world the amount has been stagnant for years and it is not increasing despite the increasing living standards and cost in Singapore.,0.99780256,0.002012266,0.00018518802

 Research headcounts (project officer research associates) do not have career progression and only minimal increment and bonuses. You can only get higher pay if you generate publications (mostly reserved for postdocs and PhD students)  Hierarchical  Bureaucratic procedures to comply with government agency guidelines. So sometimes you don't get the flexibility you need to get things done. This contradicts with the flexibility needed for research.  If you want career progression avoid this place like a plague.

Promotion and tenure policies are not transparent. NTU wishes to be the Stanford of SE Asia however the larger cultural environment does not support this idea. Undergraduate students at the university are rigid in their thinking and need to be closely mentored to engender innovation. The influx of funding is mostly due to the policies set forth by the larger Singaporean government and less so by the leadership of upper management. While medical benefits are inexpensive the actual care reflects the cost.,0.9983882,0.0014699376,0.00014188263
Academic staffs are very competent and usually very efficient and dedicated to their work.  You can also enjoy a rich campus life.

The free shuttle buses make your life much easier.  The campus is beautiful as well and you will like it living on campus.

The renumeration is competitive and the environment is vibrant it's a fast rising university and the funding success rate is rather decent.

Increasing red tape is not good for research. Regardless quite a bit of the emphasis is on publishing which does not always encourage scientific inquiry.

Content of your work is very much dependent on your professor. Do thorough research about him/her before taking the job. Some professors are better at applying for funds than leading a research project. Some even do not have a clear objective about what to achieve. Research is a very lonely job.

"Professors largely worry about their own individual research in terms of publications or funding and liberal creativity is often missing.  Unlike top US universities very few NTU professors manage to launch good startups besides or out of their research and hardly any that get international recognition.  Undergrad students have a good mix of local and international students as well as exchange students. Research students and staff are mostly from China (P.R.C) some from India and a few from other Asian or Latin American countries. Although English is official language in formal contexts the practical language of communication is Mandarin Chinese  without knowing it of course you can survive but may sometimes feel left out or lonely. This is primarily because most graduate staff/students are from China.  Research output in terms of papers published is great (as far as the numbers go). But real creativity innovation critical thinking startup culture and the ""dream wild and make them come true"" factor is largely missing especially when it comes to graduate school or research programs.  These are some reasons why NTU is still far from being another Stanford that can spawn a Silicon valley around it. Though I must say the undergrad scene is generally much better.  However it is still a very young university (just over 25 years old) and is already wellrecognized by the world and something all Singaporeans must be proud of!",0.048563085,0.94843864,0.0029982228

Doctors like to squeeze many patient in one slot they know they can’t handle definitely need ot and would be rush they still accept patients have a lot of problems and questions that require u to answer(call and email) them. Some enquires are so urgent that U need to squeeze out the time to call them in the middle of clinic. U don’t respond in time u kena. The amount of enquires or admin job often need u to work ot which are not paid  coworker(eg nurses front desk or even management) does not help each other pushes the blame or responsibility to u every morning need go there early to hear them brief(aka kaobei blame here blame there u need to do this need do that) every littlest things (eg never put something back) also want to say zzz too many complicated and unnecessary procedure/ document to do  In conclusion too many workload and have to handle too many difficult people. All can be seen by the high turnover rate and resignation Amount. Then they found out too many room assistant leaving need people then pulls people from front desk and nurse to do room assistance…,0.99891365,0.0009241683,0.000162204

Expect you to work overtime and during weekends. Load you and when you can’t deliver management say you got no deliverables. Want you to stand by after working hours(I am non medical staff) gave you task on Friday after 8pm and asked you to deliver by next Monday morning 9am. Management agreed to “bully culture”. Think very highly of the “money” that they paid to you. RO wil just transfer the stress from management to you make you front the management. And if you ask for your progression the management will just load you with all that they can and claimed that it’s what you asking for.  Very toxic and bad work culture.

"While I cannot specifically talk about NUH as a whole blood transfusion services can only be summarised as a ""highly toxic"" environment. I strongly dissuade fresh graduates to join this competitive department unless they are mentally prepared to be scrutinized deeply. Most of the senior employees here possess dominant personalities and are not forgiving. Most of them will not hesitate to ruin your career by negatively feedbacking about you behind your back. The purpose is to gain a stronger rapport with their supervisors by exploiting your tiniest of errors.  While it is a fact that individuals exploit each other to climb through their career ladder this trait of the employees is deeply embedded in the blood transfusion services culture. Senior employees here will also influence other junior colleagues to have a negative impression of you and therefore creating  an unhealthy working lifestyle for you. In addition the management there is highly judgemental and unsupportive of your views. They will come down strongly even on the pettiest of issues let alone making accidental mistakes during your course of learning. Additionally the supervisors will not hesitate to yell and embarrass you in front of your other colleagues at any point during work while displaying fake professionalism in front of their superiors. To sum it up the bullying culture exists here if you are targeted. My suggestion is to work in other areas of the Laboratory Medicine Department e.g. Chemistry or Haematology ( no guarantee that they do not have the same issue) . You can even try other hospitals where their medical technologist are required to cover all departments. This is where your ceiling to learning is higher. Blood banking is highly specific and your ceiling to learning is capped after a short while as work here is highly repetitive.  Their preference is to hire juniors. However it is a trap especially if you have no working experience in a clinical lab ( internship is not counted) as their intentions are to mold you into a yesman while strongly influencing your views on issues present.  Conclusively I strongly recommend anyone reading this review to accept this opportunity only as a last resort. Salary/benefits are important but not at the expense of your emotional and mental health. Regardless there are much better opportunities out there for you.",0.9977463,0.002097344,0.0001562509

Peerpressure to justify heavy workload work during weekend and odd hours. No career progression and Low pay. Harsh political workplace toxic people in all level i.e: junior executive till management.  Since people brings in their own friends they will form toxic groups to aleniate other group they even on each other's throat within their own group gangup and spread false accusation against individual is very common. Expect to work in fear and demoralized as you don't know who is your friend/enemy. Power crave management who will find every single reason to attack belittle and get rid of you i.e: the discrimination against minority (race marriage status citizenship status) even local is backstabbing against each other too nitpicking every single mistake nus alumni staff vs nonnus alumni staff computer sabotage or anything that you can think of.  Most of staff who join for many years still do same mistake over and over again still not know what to do don't take ownership  Unacceptable. General knowledge for high turn over staff at  NUS business science Med Ro for example because of nasty politic such as:  the staff who already resigned but being forced to write reports beyond his/her last day staff being framed being bullied being outcast sabotaged. Highly individualistic No teamwork No one share info in the nbox or email or sharepoint each of them keep work info for themselves. Just wondering how these toxic and evil people's life would be after broke many of people's rice bowl. What comes around goes around.,0.99880767,0.0010541158,0.000138231

Senior management team (SMT) are generally distrustful of the staff: 1. No remote work opportunity  SMT believes that staff are lazy and will not do work from home 2. Open office concept  open individual cubicle that makes it hard to conduct Zoom meetings with students or external clients. SMT occasionally walk around and took photos of staff who are not present in their seat 3. No staff development opportunities  no fund catered for academic staff to learn new skills; have to depend on free conferences or courses No townhall or equivalent has been conducted since the SMT is seemingly not interested to consider the views from the staff,0.99910057,0.0007409879,0.00015853878

I guess all I am about to say depends on the PI and the team anyway this is my experience: There is a generalised FAKE culture of inclusion and freedom in your work. There is so much convoluted bureaucracy that most of the time is spent doing admin related tasks. Good luck if you have to buy something for your experiments or go for a work trip  process is insane before and after I have seen people working nonstop over the weekends meetings at 6pm on Friday no balance no boundaries..than you receive a weekly wellbeing email asking if you are ok. NUS is not an international environment socially speaking you can feel very isolated not all teams and PI encourage sharing and discussing honestly no flat structure In other places I felt empowered here you are powerless some have fear to speak up and just end up nodding all the time  how sad is that?,0.99511397,0.004667997,0.00021799013

had an pretty bad experience because the manager was uninterested in teaching. This was already a red flag but I still took on the role because I believed my friends who worked there and the general understanding is that people would be professional. People also have no understanding of boundaries. When I wasn't feeling well AND they had a work from home set up i was forced to go to the office was even accused of being lazy and uninterested because I didn't want to go to the office. people like to play the blame game even when you have nothing to do with the task. left the moment I could.

It depends on the department or faculty. If you are lucky your course head or department head will make genuine effort to engage with you and be encouraging of new ideas.

If you happen to work with a department head or course head who does not view parttimers with respect it is a very taskoriented and directive environment. “Orders are given please do now” approach even on weekends.

Singapore is an attractive city to work in because it is a travel hub with many options to travel to all parts of the world for conferences and visits of family. It also offers genuine travel attractions regionally though it is itself an uninteresting tourist spot. Living in Singapore is expensive mostly because of rent and this is where the NUS housing subsidy in its various forms helped. Food is cheap if you don't wine and dine and so is public transport. Don't get a car it is absurdly expensive. Paperwork can be tedious and frustrating due to their inexplicable love for acronyms. But as with other advance Asian nations things move smoothly once everything is set. Taxation is very low but do pay attention to what is written between the lines (read good guides). Health care is good if it is covered by the employers. Else it is horrifically costly. Beware.,0.5685481,0.39087516,0.04057673
In the early days there were generous housing subsidies which is essential for an expensive city like Singapore. Then the policy makers decided to return to subsidies back to NUS books by allowing staff to stay at a discounted rate in their staff housing with the shortfall to be paid from the grant of their bosses. Overall this greatly reduced the attractiveness of NUS as an employer (whose idea was it to build those fancy apartments in the first place?). Research wise it was one of the better places in Asia to work in. However there was a chronic lack of a clear career path for nonPI's especially for international staff that really dampen my NUS experience.,0.9963825,0.0032408924,0.00037662976

There is worklife balance and flexibility but the job definitely has crunch times. The job of an RA differs across disciplines and I largely think that it is very dependent on the immediate principal investigators and coinvestigators managing the research project.

Not much progression if you do not take up additional duties (e.g. TA duties) or pursue a Master’s concurrently.

 Very little room for career growth and movement up the corporate ladder.   Lousy renumeration and can be perceived as stingy when it comes to awarding bonuses.

Presence of 'divas' in top positions whose words are gospel and who tend to rule with an iron fist making it extremely difficult to  whisper this  suggest or implement changes.

1. Incredibly slowpaced work 2. Politics everywhere. It'll trickle down to the employees and lead to them being used like chess pieces in their boss' political game without regard for the relevance of work the employees are forced to take. 3. Extremely oldfashioned. Old professors rule the world here and they do not like change. 4. Pay isn't great. Below average. 5. Common to have your boss take credit for your work. It didn't just happen to me but it happens to a lot of people all across this school. You can work for a long time on something then your boss will take it and present it at a meeting while removing your name from the PowerPoint slides. Then they'll bask in all the praise. It's just the culture here. It's a thing they all do. 6. Women may not feel comfortable working here what with all the peeping tom and sexual harassment cases arising from NUS.

There's close to zero humanity. Especially in a PhD or graduates programs. There is no effective bounding between students most student activities are limited to undergrads (you anyway won't receive most emails).  In most research labs students don't even befriend with each other so the feeling of loneliness is tangible as soon as you assist at the usual weekly meeting for research updates of each student of a professor's lab.  The school is quite traditional. Internships summer programs exchanges etc aren't encouraged.  Your worklife balance as well as your PhD duration is very dependent on your professor. Some professors will want to keep you 5 years or more just to get teaching help and more publications from you. The official minimum is 3 years which actually never happens. The duration usually varies from 4 to 5.5 years and you will need to find a source of income once the scholarship ends (4 years).,0.9987822,0.0010722989,0.00014548682

Long working hours due to many ongoing projects and changes. Bad pay master. Only value people who can sweet talk to the bosses. Some male bosses promote young female staff based on looks and how well they can sweet talk to them instead of quality of work.

If you join as a 'nonacademic staff' (i.e. nonteaching nonresearch nonexecutive positions) you are under the protection of the union. The PB and increment is determined by the union so if you work harder than your colleague but both of you get the same grade during appraisal both of you will get the same PB and salary increment.,0.9877609,0.012035089,0.0002038907
In the earlier years of joining this place if you get appraised 'meet requirement' one can get an average PB of about 2.5 months and 5%6% increment in salary.  Recently NUS started to enforce this new policy that those who are in the bottom 10% of the 'Meet requirement' category will NOT receive any PB nor increment. Imagine doing your job well but not receiving any recognition for 'meeting the requirements' of the job. Those who got promoted only received average 2.2 months' PB and 5% increment. A stark contrast to those who got promoted in the past whose PB can be as high as 3 months and increment of 10%.  No 13th month bonus for executive level and above. They claim the 13th month is already built into the monthly salary. But when you divide it out it is not worth joining this kind of company.,0.99795496,0.0018802537,0.00016471486

As a Westener working in Singapore the people at this institution make me feel very welcome. The workplace is well organised and therefore can be quickly understood and the administrators are quite efficient in helping you within their remit. This lets you get on with your research without too much fuss and be as productive as you can be. There is an annual review/assessment with the prospect of a bonus pay rise and/or promotion that makes the job feel like it might be heading somewhere which is not always the case in academia.  Nice campus to work on easy transport food gym facilities etc.  Pay and benefits decent.  The quality of those other researchers around you will depend on the specific group/department within which you work so I don't discuss that here.,0.0013867065,0.0057495967,0.9928637
Perhaps the downside of the high organisation is that sometimes you have to jump through bureaucratic hoops. Expect on occasion to have to take some time out of work to watch a series of lectures and pass a surprisingly detailed exam (all online) on fire safety or conflicts of interests then fill out a long end of year assessment that is probably only read by someone you talk to anyway.

Job Title: PhD student. Hence it seriously depends on your supervisor.   (1) Flexible time depending on your PI's style.  I have worked with supervisors as a research assistant before which insist on attendancetaking at 8:30 am in the morning. My current PI is very flexible as along as you are doing your job. The stress only comes from peer pressure and selfdriven ambition to get great results in your research.  (2) Health insurance benefit Health insurance that is relatively good although you do not have access to free treatment at NUS Clinic. However the insurance company does cover my surgery due to accident so it is relatively great  (3) Food court with subsidized rates You can eat at university which sells food much cheaper than outside university setting,0.01005831,0.91114926,0.078792416
1) It can be stressful environment depending on your PI the nature and progress of your research etc  2) Low salary relative to peers Hey you know what you sign up for....  3) Job prospects  Depending on your degree and research job prospects can be relatively great or poor. The only available jobs relevant to my research topic is are research fellow positions by my supervisor or his colleagues (or competitors) either in NUS or NTU or overseas universities. Hence your research topic is more relevant than university if you wish to find job outside academia.,0.96809524,0.031601503,0.0003033255

Handling administrative stuff can be really painful. All depends whether the staff likes you or not. I'm the unlucky one.  Huge amount of paper work lots of restriction on buying equipment/consumable/hiring/training cost. Administrative staff knows all the tricks on staff benefits but try their best to hide from you.  case1: Accidentally cc me a email about other staff's salary(probably just to show me that I'm on the lower rank and hope that i'll get angry and quit).  case2: Our department secretary refuse to change my supervisor on the system to my actual boss for more than one year and she gave me a performance rating of C that year. My supervisor tried to fight for me to change my rating to A I got a email of apologize in the end the difference in bonus was not compensated.  There are more of such examples such a waste of life and energy.  If the job itself it's not interesting enough not recommended.,0.9988764,0.00097310514,0.00015051271
There are plenty of opportunities for students to widen their experience such as the Student Exchange Program (SEP) and NUS Overseas College (NOC).

The classes are often too big limiting lecturer interaction with students Due to the limited interaction between teaching staff and students in general it can be quite difficult to get a recommendation letter especially if you haven't/don't do Honours Limited discussion during lessons and too much spoonfeeding quite a lot of rote learning Can be very unforgiving towards mistakes. Once I missed an exam because I accidentally read the wrong schedule and I (being too honest not to fake a medical certificate) was given an F which was computed to my CAP (retaking the module would not make any difference as well). Many admin staff are rude and slow Sometimes I felt like I was a robot being produced in a production line. But maybe that was just me.,0.9986119,0.0012476271,0.0001404793

 For a business unit  we don't get paid for bringing in more sales/revenue.  In fact we get levied by the university.  There is performance bonus but it is heavily dependent on your manager.  Bureaucracy like every most places slows down productivity but the Org Excellence are working on it.   Misalignment between senior management and midmanagers occur very often in large organisations. So communicating changes and new directions is  very crucial but may be overlooked.,0.99876726,0.0010862425,0.00014661644
Asia's top university. Offer a variety of subjects that are on the top 540 university subject ranking but none of them actually been really practical. Maybe it's because I'm in Arts. A lot of overseas exchange or internship opportunity. Great facilities with a new update every semester e.g. we just got a new canteen at Utown and whole new range of vending machine in library selling customers goods and food and drink. This is due to high government fund on university.,0.011706875,0.099169545,0.88912356
The teaching quality varies and some professors can't teach. A lot of abovementioned activity limited to those with high CAP/GPA and awesome extracurricular activities. It's hard to find a job here as an international student if you are not from the STEM.  Also a lot of opportunities comes when you agree to sign up for the 3year bond with Ministry of Education to work in Singapore after graduation. If you don't you cannot get tuition subsidies financial assistance and lots other benefits from the university. So think carefully. Working in Singapore is harder for nonPR or nonSingaporean.,0.99106944,0.00853621,0.00039431735

Unless you are hired as a tenured staff (academic) or for administrative purposes there's no clear career path set out for young inspiring junior R&D staff. Most of the fellowship are open for all from around the globe and therefore the competition is intense. In addition be prepared to work overtime from time to time as the PIs here are demanding and seldom they could execute much needed time management in their projects and they would ask the staffs for results over a short phone call to be delivered over short time span.,0.99882466,0.0010152081,0.00016018814
Except events that make eat into personal time you get to knock off on time mostly. Manageable workload with clearly defined KPIs.

Things can be slow so if you're someone that wants to move fast then it may be a drag for you. While things do get done eventually you have to prepare for gatherings where you may not know half the people in your office because it's simply too huge. Yet when things happen in an individual's personal life you are expected to turn up. Or rather there's an invisible pressure to. Things like weddings and funerals of people that you personally don't feel close to? Yeah you may need to be involved.,0.9974105,0.002447386,0.00014223008
You probably get to work with a professor you like but note that this opportunity is only useful if you intend to go into academia.

" Toxic work environment.  Lacks professionalism.  You are constantly reminded that you are a ""foreigner"" and therefore ""must appreciate this opportunity"". They don't  listen to you no matter what because you don't matter.  Limited funding. Can't even buy a 600$ software.  Low pay. The common PhD stipend is a bare minimum. It doesn't take into account the social life.  (In School of Computing) The program takes min 5 years unlike the advertised 4 years. And your scholarship will not cover the 5th (or 6th) year. Then you will have to pay $15K per semester. ( The faculty and administration are aware of this issue but would not extend the scholarship because they think you will work better/faster when you fear for the payments for your 5th year.)",0.9990362,0.00079843384,0.00016541465
It is an university combining both Asian and western style of teaching living and any other things.

NUS has some excellent opportunities for postdoctoral and advanced fellowships in the social sciences and the humanities. These fellowships are offered by colleges departments and special institutes and are great opportunities for junior scholars to complete research programs in the region. The caliber of intellectual engagement at NUS is very high and the university is committed to becoming the premier university in SEA. Fellows will generally find a collegial atmosphere that is supportive of innovative research. Research money is available and most fellows are permitted (and expected) to travel for fieldwork for part of their fellowship. Life in Singapore is pleasant and safe and it is easy to access the rest of the region East Asia and Australia from the island.,0.0001972307,0.0002698494,0.99953294
The cost of living in Singapore is exorbitant and NUS generally does not provide faculty housing or substantive housing allowance for junior fellows and postdoctoral researchers instead prioritizing more senior and 'big name' researchers and providing them with housing. The average cost of renting a public housing block apartment in Singapore now stands at between 5070% of a postdoctoral fellow's monthly salary (including the paltry housing allowance provided for foreign fellows). Single fellows can compensate by sharing housing with other fellows or renting a room but married fellows or those with children are increasingly finding it difficult to make ends meet.   Fellows doing research on Singaporean life (particularly politics) need to be aware of some potential for restrictions on intellectual freedom.   Singapore is a pleasant place to live with many amenities for families. It is however somewhat sterile and the cost of amenities (particularly alcohol  which is subject to a 100% luxury tax) can be steep. Families with children will need to consider schooling options  public school is an option although it may not be appropriate for all children and work permit holders have lowest priority in the school system. Many excellent international schools are located in Singapore however these tend to be quite expensive and NUS does not provide a tuition subsidy.,0.99593425,0.0035803795,0.0004853298

Firstly let me begin by saying that NUS is HUGE. There are many many different professors each of whom act like minor Barons running their labs as they each see fit.

Summary: I worked in NVPC Digital Innovation Dept for 1 year. During my time there I experienced poor work management favoritism low KPI targets uneven workload and bad people management. Work Management The work management in the IT department was very poor. The director would often side with her favorite staffs even when they were clearly in the wrong. This created a lot of resentment among the other staff and made it difficult to get anything done. KPI Targets Some staffs KPI targets were very low which meant that staff could slack off all year and still meet their targets. This needs to be seriously reviewed Workload The workload was unevenly distributed with some staff having very little to do while others were constantly overworked. This created a lot of tension between staff and made it difficult to get any work done. People Management The people management in the IT department was very poor. The director was often dismissive of staff and she would often make flipflop decisions. This made it very difficult to work effectively and led to a lot of staff turnover. Conclusion I would not recommend working in the IT department of NVPC Digital Innovation Dept. The work management is poor there is favoritism the KPI targets are low the workload is unevenly distributed and the people management is poor. Recommendations I would recommend that the director of the IT department take the following steps to improve the work environment: Be objective Balanced KPI targets amount the staffs Distribute the workload more evenly. Improve her people management skills. Make decisions more consistently. I believe that these changes would make the IT department a more pleasant and productive place to work.,0.9978872,0.0016961847,0.0004165563

Can get a little noisy sometimes with the open concept environment. Nonprofit means salary would not be comparable to profitcompanies.

A lot of meetings are timewasters and can go on for 3 hours  why??!! We have better things to do.

They send you off campus to teach and refuse to take into account your travel time.  Some people get bullied by management.

"The bosses here are extremely unforgiving. If they can sense that you cannot be used as a tool for their own advancement you will be ""actively managed"" out of their payroll. This is done with lousy appraisals (sorry even if you worked your butt off for your boss you can still get zero bonus and a ""needs improvement"" rating) or they will simply not renew your contract. It's a very cruel system here. But a good one because this is a place that is not for staying long. Learn what you can and move on. In all fairness it is a great place to learn things esp if you have to interface with the Ministry directly. You'll pick up valuable writing skills and organisation skills. But by the time you learn all these and if you don't click with your boss it's time to go. Also bosses do not respect worklife balance even though the HR policies are in line with the rest of the public service. You can be on annual leave and yet can receive an email from your boss that you are to turn in a piece of urgent work by 10am the next day. The cake is he knows you are on leave. And when you return the next day and explain that you could not work on his orders because you took leave for a reason he still expects the work to be turned in by 10am. This happens all the time. And you will get a lousy performance rating simply because you couldn't turn in your work on time.  By all means join NP if you are younger and still have time to job hop around.

This review is for the mega centre at punggol only. Disclaimer: Not all PCF centres may be like this.   Principals and senior teachers view CCTV everyday to pick on every single thing.  Principal speak with sarcasm towards their teachers and even personal attack.   Too much focus on unnecessary things like wearing of uniform (you will be asked to go home to change even if your uniform is not yet dry from washing) tying up of hair (only can tie bun or full ponytail) hair cannot even be dyed light brown (not even bright at all) only can wear black formal pants.  Centre does not replace toys/materials that are spoilt only have 4 tricycles when you have more than 10 children in a class lol.  Big centre with low budget (hire external company cleaners but they do nothing much. Bulk of the cleaning come from the teachers such as rinsing toilets cleaning pillars wash toys clean shelves & shoe racks sweep and mop) The senior teachers will go around classroom to swipe their fingers against furniture to check if it is dustfree.   Centre is like a flower vase look pretty on the outside but empty on the inside. Teachers there are all either physically or mentally tired.   There are a total of 3 principals taking different levels and all 3 of them are unable to work cooperatively. Making it difficult for teachers working under them (different rules different sop different working hours different celebration dates which often leads to parent's questioning if they have siblings in different levels)   The teachers there are all cooperative and have great teamwork. However the principals in the centre are horrible. They make your life a living hll when you are serving your notice period. There is a high turnover rate in that centre. Do not be deceived by the centre's facade.,0.9977456,0.0020098533,0.00024451024

 high workload because teachers have to do a lot of the activities and lesson material as the schools don't give much budget for commercial items.  teachers are treated badly by management and parents. Management will favor parents even if their requests are undeniable inappropriate/ unfair to other kids. Terrible medical benefits despite the fact that the environment will cause any teachers to fall ill very often.  You will need to attend work even if you're sick and leave a few hours later even if you have MC for that day.  horrible welfare no union as well.,0.99904174,0.00078926946,0.00016894873
I believe that the benefits for employees are one of the best among preschool organisations despite a lower starting pay.  Trainings were also provided for staff (mandatory to fulfil a minimum number of hours per year) and there was a rather wide range of it available. Career progression wise it could get quite limited at times as I believe not many centres would need more than 2 senior teachers or even have a vice principal.,0.091198824,0.71019185,0.19860928
"It honestly depends on the regions you work in. Unfortunately the region I was in was very hierarchical supervisors were very much authoritativelike figures thus making the work experience albeit unpleasant (I recalled one of the meetings where the EP asked ""why is this centre's teacher turnover rate so low?"" – it shocked me really)",0.99768484,0.0021983895,0.00011675067
You get to work with the poorest and most disadvantaged children in Singapore. Even though they don't explicitly say it you are in the social service sector. And therefore majority of parents' expectations are not that high  which translates into a lesser burden of keeping them updated on the child's progress. You may have alot of free play into deciding how things are run in your classroom as the principal may be too busy with her admin work to check on you. You finish work latest at 5.30pm. The company will organise alot of workshops / learning journeys for you to attend and upgrade your skills for free. Each centre has allocated funds to spend on learning resources. If thing gets too old and tattered its highly possible to purchase a new one instead of making a DIY replacement due to budget constraints. Facilities are continually upgraded and so you need not fear having things breaking down.,0.94802374,0.050974272,0.0010020128
Very disorganised and clueless about employee satisfaction motivation and retention.  The working environment for a kindergarten teacher very much depends on the centre's principal and the existing teachers. If they are veterans you're in good hands. If not (which is not uncommon with the high turnover rates) then you would have to survive on your own as everybody else has their own problems to deal with. There isn't much mentoring / coaching available unless you seek it out and manage to find someone to help you along. Because kindergartens have 2 sessions  morning and afternoon and each session having 18 to 20 children you might have to spend time after your last dismissal (after 5.30pm?) to prepare for the next day. Apart from Nursery children K1 and K2 classes may not have an assistant teacher around. So you need to be able to have solid classroom management skills if you got 20 children under your care. Because the central curriculum isn't perfect there may need to be alterations to it. and every alteration needs to be recorded in a lesson plan weekly plan scheme of work term plan. So if you are good in creating and drafting out plans its a breeze for you. If not this is a pain point for many existing and new teachers alike. Teachers are required to participate in community events after work hours like festivals and celebrations and most of the time prepping the children for some show for the public. Unless you love performance art this puts an additional strain on your part. When term starts there is a rush to things to be done. Its hard (but not impossible) to cater for differentiated learning because the goal of the organisation is for quantity teaching not quality teaching.,0.9969067,0.00287928,0.00021400765

It is undeniable that the current EXCO office bearers make it challenging to conduct daily operations.

Staff benefits are not adequately evaluated and office bearers such as the President and Sec Gen/IMH have been awarded enormous permanent offices at HQ. Why do they receive free parking cash cards and mobile phone allowances as volunteers? If you don't believe check the annual report and the financial statement!

"Management is the absolute worst. School leaders only care about squeezing every drop of sweat and blood out of you by piling you up with as much POINTLESS paperwork as they can. The amount of admin work needless meetings and paperwork is just RIDICULOUS! Every now and then school leaders will organize a session to ""address"" staff's concerns but it's just a public relations stunt to give you the illusion that they're listening to you and will help solve problems when they actually don't (you can ask any of the exstaff here they'll confirm what I said is true).  The entire organisation also has this ridiculous unethical practice called the MC relief duty where you have to stay back once or twice a month to cover people who are on MC; it's basically doing two school sessions back to back with one hour of break in between. Honestly it's pointless because most people who do MC relief end up taking MC the following day anyway because it's just plain exhausting. Also school leaders can adjust the number of days according to their whims and fancies; there have been instances when some of the staff were asked to do more days when they were affected by covid home quarantine orders.  And then the management wonders WHY people take MC. Time and again staff have asked to do away with this MC relief duty and hire more relief staff or have a ready pool of part timers on standby so there's always people to cover people on leave but nOoO because according to management we work less hours so the burden should fall on our shoulders.. bear in mind that teachers and learning facilitators have to do toileting and handling of complex student behaviours ON TOP OF teaching duties planning of lessons preparing lesson materials AND CCA duties.  The school management really does its absolute best in stretching you out to your limits that many good teachers and learning facilitators end up leaving and then management wonders why staff turnover is so high.",0.99854726,0.0012930908,0.00015958336

1. Overwhelming workload with updating the weekly task analysis on the OCMS. 1 educational goal could have 30 steps in the task analysis = clicking 30 rows of options.  2. Communication issue between everyone leading the lower position holders (teachers senior learning facilitators learning facilitators class support to suffer). Lead Teacher wants Teachers and learning facilitator to do this but Senior Teacher says another. 3. Organization only values TRAINED staff but not untrained and experienced staff.  4. Lead Teachers and Teaching and Learning Specialist have their own preferred group of staff. These staff will always get the good almost academic class. Once you get into their group you will get to go for the diploma in special education earlier than those who waited for more than 5 years. These group of staff often get the most for performance bonus because no incident report and have the likings of the lead teacher and teaching and learning specialist.  5. Constant threats by senior teachers and lead teachers 6. Taking leave is difficult most staff had to beg to take leave for caregiving issues. On a few occasions lead teacher will ask you to come back before you get to see the doctor (no violation of labour laws if you have not taken your mc).   Management has no empathy. Teaching staff (Teacher Learning Facilitator Class Support) want to take leave by sending message and email to management but no reply. Want to take leave for urgent family matters or exam leave also need to beg the management level holders to ask for clearance to have the leave.  7. Several occasions low position holders were asked to come back by the lead teachers and were not allowed to go to the doctors despite reporting of being sick on that day. 8. Once a month you will need to work two shifts if you are a teacher or learning facilitator. 9. Does not care about lower position teaching staff safety especially during the Covid situation by asking them to go to multiple classroom. They do not adhere to SMM. If the senior teacher does not want to go into a class whom a student had Covid they will deploy the lower position teaching staff.,0.9978242,0.0019872782,0.00018855148

Leaders are autocratic. Let me share just 1 story. Once a Director decided to go through every single point (approx 20 points).

 Work becomes mundane after a while (e.g. lecturers repeatedly teach a handful of modules and the concepts taught are very rudimentary in nature).   Strong emphasis on 'extracurricular activities' in work review. Daily work such as teaching mentoring and marking will not lend much weight during work review and lecturers are expected to embark on industry projects develop new CET courses or lead key events in order to achieve a good performance grade at year end.   Narrow salary range in each salary band. Under the ITE Polytechnic Scheme the distance between the minimum vs maximum salary under each band is about $2 thousand dollars. This means that a lecturer can reach the wage ceiling in his/her band rather quickly (sometimes as fast as 3 years). This creates an endless cycle to push yourself to perform to get a B grade (which is needed on the year of your promotion) otherwise you suffer from a lack of increment that year. Many colleagues in RP have in fact been stuck at their salary band for many years (some even as long as 10 years).   Under RP's PBL system students are usually assigned a grade by the lecturer based on their performance in each lesson. This process can sometimes become political as students wants to get good grades (sometimes regardless of their performances in class). Students can question the grades you gave them in the prior week and gets upset when the grades fall short of their expectation. This means that sometime lecturers do give students an inflated grade just to appease their students whom they have to face weekin weekout. The grading becomes a process of appeasement instead of based on actual performance in class.   Management's lack of emphasis on staff's professional development. Management pay lip service by repeating the mantra that we need to develop futureready skills but there is a lack of concrete plans on how the staff should go about doing this. There is in place a Industry Associate Scheme ('IAS') whereby lecturers can be 'attached' to a company in the industry to pick up practical knowledge but there is no offloading of work if a lecturer chooses to go for the attachment. As a result the lecturer juggles between meeting the expectation of the industry partner during the attachment (there is often a project carved out for completion during the IAS) while completing his/her normal duties in RP.,0.9985178,0.0013124723,0.00016970979

Toxic working environment ensnared in bureaucratic power struggles.  Lack of transparency and low trust 'watch your back' culture. Leadership was about protecting turf and career preservation.  No sense of your boss having your back. 'Friendly' fire was the norm. Inept managers who interviewed you for one job and deployed you into another (temporarily at first then permanently). Potential careerwreckers.  No genuine effort to address issues but adopted a 'justgetitdone' attitude. End result was constant firefighting. No sense of achievement. (Both academic and administrative staff) locked into using a multimillion dollar academic IT management system  fraught with technical issues and relying on inefficient workarounds.  Senior management oblivious (or conveniently chose to be) to failings of HOD despite numerous exit interview feedback and very high turnover record. Poor worklife balance.

"1. Management within diploma team (at least for mine) has poor leadership  lacks a clear sense of direction as too eager to please everyone.  2. Work can get too routine and monotonous  imagine teaching the same module every semester (although we do have a ""choice"" to select modules to teach there is unwritten rule that we need to pick modules that are related to own diploma team which means ultimately your boss gets to decide which module you are going to teach. And usually it's the same module you used to teach previous run). 3. KPIs set by management do not value highly the bread and butter issue of raising the quality of education for students. Staff who have the talent and are interested in academic work such as curriculum development usually lose out in terms of career progression and promotion as compared to others who take on high profile projects and competitions. As a result excellent educators feel jaded and inclined to leave.  4. Career progression from lecturer to senior lecturer is very slow.

 High standard of clinical practice. You can and will learn a lot from your senior colleagues who are probably at the top of their fields in Singapore and on par with the best in the world.  Decent pay. You can definitely afford a condominium as a consultant (albeit a small one),0.02425889,0.09022541,0.8855157
Leadership is almost always based on seniority and the same senior staff get promoted to (higher) positions of leadership. The young have much less say/influence. Stuck in same old ways of (group) think and politics  Research education innovation always take a backseat to clinical service. With the ageing population there is just so much clinical work to do that ultimately we become a service hospital rather than an academic centre. It's fine honestly since that's what hospitals should do first and foremost. But please don't say we're an academic centre when we honestly don't prioritise research education and innovation with time money and manpower.  Resources for research education and innovation when done are concentrated in the hands of a few very established groups/individuals. It is very difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold into these as the support ecosystems (e.g. armies of clinical research coordinators/administrative support) just do not exist.  Pay while decent in no way reflects the times we are in. Volume AND complexity of work have increased tremendously in the past few years (not talking about past decade just the past few years COVID notwithstanding). Inflation has skyrocketed. Yet pay has not shifted up. Locum rates for consultants have not changed for 2 decades/have changed only for certain departments. Burnout is rampant. I presume this will only get worse with the new percapitation model where the govt gives a fixed budget to each hospital for the population it serves (which quite frankly does not make any sense since an ageing population with a high life expectancy is necessarily a medically complex population where no amount of preventive health measures can prevent the ordering of investigations to troubleshoot when they come to hospital for undifferentiated symptoms. The only way you can curb unbridled/thoughtless healthcare spending is if you do something unpolitically correct like saying after the age of 85 or 90 or if you have been deemed to have <6 months of life expectancy you have no more subsidies for certain investigations/treatments. ),0.9986279,0.0012184697,0.00015372595

 Below average compensation and salary  Ain't that bad actually but it is below average compared to other industries   Narrow scope of work and tools  Expect to do a lot of data automation using R and dashboarding using Tableau. Minimal analytics work even though you are a socalled Data Analyst.   This is not a place for the snake language supporters. However you may get to try on how to use local git that only works when u in office.   Nonexistence support for data analysts beyond central department not even from central department  Analysts can be placed anywhere in SGH but there are centralized zoom sharing every now and then. If you are placed in the external departments expect to work independently. You should have working R knowledge and dashboarding skills before taking up the job because the only support you are getting is probably the pantry snacks   Career outlook not great for tech workers  Realistically speaking what are the career tracks for tech workers in healthcare?  The top positions will never be filled by a nondoctor and the middle management will be being dominated by executives. Average caliber of executives quite high because where can they come from?   1) Nonpracticing doctors 2) Former nurses 3) Best from the cohort of life science chemistry pharmacy etc (where else can they go though really?)  Tech will become big in healthcare but it is hard to see tech workers being able to compete with the other 2 groups.   Questionable technical abilities of middle management  More likely than not you will be reporting under a nontechnical manager. While they do have strong domain knowledge you really would have to question their data capabilities. It seems that they are more concerned with getting out the first output rather than focusing on the maintainability and accuracy.,0.9984383,0.0013960757,0.00016565243

Well you're working in a environment full of Indians and that can be very mentally draining.

Managed by 60 year old Chinese men who do not know how to properly manage people. False narrative of being applied learning university when it is be becoming more of your traditional academic university.  Management constantly gives vague remarks.

 serious transboundary air pollution since the new campus is located at the northern tip of Punggol close to Pasir Gudang (a petrochemical site in Johor Malaysia).  Senior management has too many retired civil servants (retired army generals ministers etc.) making one wonders if this institution was expressly set up so that these retired VIPs can continue to draw exorbitant salaries.   with the establishment of SG's fifth university are we producing too many graduates? Are there enough quality jobs in the market for all of them? Will this lead to higher rates of unemployment (or underemployment). Recent data shows that unemployment rate in Singapore has climbed to 2.3% in Q3 (2019). With the first batches from SIT entering the job market are we expecting to see the above figure climb up even higher?,0.998804,0.0010565053,0.00013957318

Because it's moving so fast that the direction always change. The management only talks within the management and how good are the messages translated to the ground staff highly depends on how capable the each division's leader is. if the leader cannot make it = the ground staff will feel super lost. Basically ground staff almost has no access to management at all.  Different division only like to do their own things and only think about each division KPI instead of SIT as a whole. Because of that there's a lot of pushing of responsibilities and work to each other and eventually no one wants to take it even though those are real work that needs to be done.   Some leaders are really bad at giving direction some even like to take the ground staff's work as their own credit and tell the management. So the management also blindly write email to thank the leader who did nothing and the leader will show off how good he or she is to the whole world by quoting  management names as their back up.  It's a good company that is very bad at hiring the right leader to lead. (some management people are really nice and great but there's just a handful who really cmi).  There's core value in the organisation but nobody is performing it right. It's just words.,0.9898796,0.009650935,0.00046935873

 Constant change in processes makes it very difficult to keep up. The processes here can change on the fly without being formally informed to the team. Considered yourself lucky if you were informed about it.  Too many leaders but no leadership.  No sense of ownership or accountability within the team which makes the already confusing work place even more challenging to work in.  Calls are left without being put on break mode which causes it to be abandoned till it goes to the next available person. Issue was finally caught before I left the place.  No one actually follow up with their cases promptly therefore causing delays and complain by users and staffs.  No equal access to the Systems across all team members which make our efficient level drop.  Not wanting to train new hire even before the new hire was onboarded. One of the seniors went on a rant and decided to not be available on the week when the new hire was onboarded to avoid training them.  Using other colleague's name to sign off is a trend for some reason here. I've been caught in such situation multiple times and had to confront them accordingly.  Empowerment to make decision. Almost everything had to be checked again and again to confirm there’s no change in process. Get’s very annoying.  Trust is very much broken within the team which is the most annoying thing to happen. Do not always assume those who are newly hired into the team are inexperienced. It is not in your right to judge anyone who joins the team.  In summary easily one of the most demoralising place to work because there's no sense of belonging or achievement here.,0.9990125,0.00083476503,0.00015281574

Management is fraught with its own entrenchment and silos. Management and leadership are surprisingly slow to adopt best practices. Faculty takes a really long time to get moving and takes a long time to agree on keeping abreast of problems in student body. Incentives for employees are horribly designed; many colleagues work hard and are unable to add these adhoc projects as part of their evaluation. After a while people simply stop trying or leave.,0.9990489,0.0007993229,0.00015172851
I was there in a few months however still have lots of good impression. Good Working Environment. People here pay a lot of attention on improving the surrounding such as planning trees checking air quality. Good social health benefit for employees. Also there is many privileges when you works here like playroom fitness invitations to special events tickets to take your friends and family to some entertaining areas in a year.,0.00021132699,0.0002836343,0.99950504
Perhaps the things that make me need to speak is the condition of work in the weekend. As a research engineer I love research and want to devote my time as much as possible to my work. So I used to go the laboratory to gather some information and push progress. However the room is so hot because people turned off the air system (no way to turn on) so it is very hard for me to work and produce qualified report.,0.9949903,0.0047859317,0.00022379382

Compensation is very very low for the inputs and value provided. Need to increase the compensation levels to attract and retain talent to achieve more strategic goals. Titles are inflated; everyone is a manager senior excutive  unable to grow and lead a team if everyone has the same title within the team.  Lack of work life balance Hiring process and salary compensation is not transparent Alot of bickering and politics,0.99896765,0.00088948995,0.00014290851
The office location is very strategic and closed to Bugis MRT station.,0.00036646947,0.0008038805,0.99882966
The turnover rate is extremely high as the company does not provide coaching or anything to help employees in keeping their jobs.  Employees are always bickering and stabbing each other.  Favoritism is highly practiced and policy is not enforced.  The upper management has no consistency on how employees or managers are reprimanded or counseled.   They never speak to the ground staff or even look in their eyes when they walk by.,0.9990939,0.0007476843,0.0001584428

The teaching and engagement with student during lessons are the best experience some of the student bond with the lecturers and came back to visit time to time for chat. Seeing the teaching helps the students achieve success after graduation brings a lot of great joy of being a mentor. The time is also much more flexible for spending with family compare to working in corporation. You also can claim the training programs that you took to improve your traits outside the school so you can continue improving your skill set.,0.00033518483,0.0004586229,0.99920624
Politic Politic Politic! It's actually very surprising to find that politic in the education institution is much more intense than working in corporation. There are a lot of people here (who can't teach) playing politic to achieve what they want by hurting others (who can teach). Situation also doesn't help by senior management being favoritism to their own people so career prospect is greatly blocked. They would prefer people who contribute more to Administration works (Another surprise!) than the actual teaching work itself so a lot of people hated the environment and left eventually because of the above reasons.,0.998387,0.0014755391,0.00013742925

Management has a messianic attitude and looks down on all nonmanagement level staff even the academics and has set impressions on how academics should look behave talk or even perform  most of which are outdated notions and have nothing to do with actually performing.

Relative to other local institutions the teaching is extremely lightweight as most of the courses (1) run for 36 weeks in a semester and are (2) developed and delivered by associate/adjunct faculty. Fulltime faculty take on the weight of the administrative duties such as enrolment scheduling class audits student engagement and assignment/exam moderation. Some privileges are given to those whose grant applications are successful but otherwise there is little to no incentive for research.   In sum the administrative work and internal projects are quite timeconsuming and repetitive. Earlycareer scholars are also not given much support for professional development which can negatively impact their prospects.,0.99844885,0.0014017045,0.00014935526

Paper work = fill up hardcopy form and submit personally to departments. How advance! HR doesn’t really do much to engage employees.

The biggest red flag for this workplace is the high rotation rate of employees. It is not rare to receive automatic replies from exemployees indicating that they no longer work at this place. This problem is endemic to staff researchers and now even faculty members. The management processes are inefficient and pointless there's a lot of red tape everywhere and the red tape is only there for liability reasons and not to solve any issue in particular. As a matter of fact a lot of this red tape only makes everything run worse but I guess it helps to shift the blame is something goes unexpected. New IT tools that are supposed to make employees lives easier do not solve any of these issues and only create additional red tape. Communication of critical information is almost nonexistent and in the cases where you receive this information it arrives too late. Nevertheless there is an endless spam of nonrelevant information by email. The university is facing serious challenges to survive. The university is sandwiched between the prestige and history of traditional universities in Singapore and the meteoric rise of new public universities that did not got behind as this one. There is an attempt at creating an appropriate infrastructure and environment for research but in many cases this end without career growth opportunities and eventually the cycle of being unable to retain talent repeats.,0.998872,0.0009785814,0.0001493902

"The university is a mess. After the funding president Tom Magnanti left in 2017 the provost at that time Chong Tow Chong was in charge of finding a new president at the international level. But instead of doing that he took over the position (and salary and benefits) cut all the connection of the university with MIT and started replacing professors with a reputation at the international level with mediocre old faculty rejected from NUS and NTU pushing out many (tenured) international faculty.  In the last five years the university has changed from aiming to be ""The MIT of Asia"" to a glorified Poly with the only purpose of draining taxpayers' money. SUTD has a significant chance of becoming a massive scandal if Singaporeans ever learn all the details of how a bunch of old uncles has taken their taxes supposedly to make a modern and groundbreaking university to empower new generations to get rid of the international  team and scope build a massive endowment to invest in the stock market and give themselves huge salaries and bonuses.",0.99775153,0.0020440624,0.0002045044

 Employers were abusive and the university and country had no way to protect the employees or prevent abuse.   The location has nothing much near it and it is on the East side of Singapore which is residential.   Many unhappy students for good reasons. The location and small school size are claustrophobic and the curriculum would be very (very) boring for smart students or students who realize that they do not want to be engineers or architects after all.    No one not even the professors wants to stay there long. This means if you stay for a long time your advisor may keep changing or your coworkers will come and go without a word making it difficult to create long term collaborations.

Onboarding new staff (getting set up on systems and getting a space) is problematic office spaces and desks are as bad (cramped poorly lit often smelly) as anywhere else in Singapore do not in way reflect the 'design' focus of the university academics are separated from their groups (as are often group members from each other) railing edges around every outdoor hallway are below the centre of gravity of many people (I wouldn't be wholly surprised if a someone looking at their smartphone fell off the building)and simple reimbursement procedures or invoice payments through the finance department can take several months.

Depends on who you meet. Some senior management are not innovative esp those nearing retirement age who just wants to play it safe. Lots of old staff who joined for 20 to 30 years ago are contented with current pay grade and does not want to do more. I left because my boss and subordinates are not forward looking and are not interested in improving the work. TP does not offer permanent positions.. all staff are under contract except for those that joined 20 years ago under a different scheme. There is NO opportunity to convert to permanent even though they keep telling u your contract is a 'permanent' one. This arrangement also means they can let go of you without any severance package by simply not renewing your contract.

 My supervisor had little knowledge of social media web platforms and the lingo that youths these days use yet she was put in charge of these areas and to reach out to potential students. Example there was an official Twitter page she had to manage and oversea but she did not know how to log in what a tweet was and the role of #s and @s.   Very obvious biased behaviour. There was an employee who came in at 10:30 to 11:30 instead of the reporting time of 8:30 (he did not make up for hours lost). He was always on game websites and forums when at his desk. Yet such behaviours were condoned.   Hardworking employees were not rewarded or shown appreciation.,0.9988777,0.000963737,0.00015855285

like all stat boards there are red tapes.

The organisation is very topdown hierarchical. Senior management does not care about their staff listen to their opinions trust that they hired them to do their job and treat them without the respect or dignity they deserve.   The board and CEO run the whole organisation and lead the charge in an extremely backward view of conservation. Many of the people the hire include CEO and COO or consultants know nothing about conservation or sustainability and yet boss everyone around like they are running a dictatorship. They are losing valuable amazing and talented people and they don't care as the treat their jobs like it's a retirement job and it's the last leg of their career. Whereas the people who actually care and want to make real change are being dumbed down pushed aside and expected to do as asked with no ability to think outside the box what so ever. Forget about career progression unless you are senior management no promotions at all.   The extreme micromanagement and approval processes makes a nonprofit that is supposed to lead the change absolutely redundant and useless. I have completely lost faith in the integrity and responsibility of the organisation to make systemic change and do its job for the right cause.,0.99855655,0.001252778,0.00019067172

Senior management has no conservation background. In fact they barely have any NGO background. The rather mysterious board with connections to the government seems to be running the show to please the government and pat them on their back rather than reflect on the real environmental issues of our time.   What is even worse is that anyone in an implementer position is paid terribly with little or no chance of career development and growth. In contrast while nobody really knows where donor money truly goes senior management get paid expat level salaries and seem to be easily promoted even though they do no work.  If you're looking to join at a junior level because you are passionate about the cause please look elsewhere. This is a sweatshop that will dry you out to fill senior management pockets with donor money and keep the government happy.,0.99843913,0.0013832708,0.00017753987

" The pay is a joke. You can expect to hear how the management is ""reviewing the salary structure"" it's a lie. I have heard this for over a year and the only salary bumps you will see happening are your friends’ who do not work in WWF. There is literally ZERO adjustment to your salary unless you get promoted and even then the pay raise is ridiculously low. What this means is that if you factor in inflation your purchasing power is literally decreasing year by year. Meanwhile whatever money the organisation does have goes into hiring consultants who are paid to do the jobs of the management themselves. I get that you don’t enter an NGO for money but at the very least shouldn’t a company provide fair wages? What makes this fact even harder to swallow is that we actively advocate for businesses to pay their employees fairly as required by sustainable certifications but we fail to hold ourselves to the same standards. After seeing this happening for so long I have decided to stop all my donations to this place. I would rather burn this money than continue giving it away to this bunch of selfserving people.   Big egos and a complete lack of understanding towards conservation amongst the management. The former could be addressed if the people in question are willing to learn but unfortunately the majority choose to remain wilfully ignorant or outright refuse to bother. The situation is exacerbated when the management attempts to run this organisation like a private business (e.g. a bank) or like an army. Some of the Csuite level/directors are unable to take no for an answer and will retaliate to make your life utterly miserable. The rest are too scared to stand up for what's right and will simply watch as this happens. Pretty ironic considering how this company claims that its values include courage and integrity. The management fails to see that conservation includes more than protection of habitats it includes educating the public holding businesses and governments accountable for their actions. Granted that Singapore’s politics are harder to influence; this does not mean impossible. However since the board and even some members of the management have connections with the politicians they are leery of anything that could be seen as “criticism”. So if you are looking to change Sg in this manner look elsewhere. There are local NGOs who do a better job than this place.   Lack of communication transparency and trust. This organisation has a nasty habit of springing bad news and key developments/changes (e.g. the changing of our 13th month pay) last minute usually in the late evening or at night on a Friday. Announcements are made with no proper brief no proper FAQs and employees are just supposed to roll with it. If this is a tactic to evade potential backlash and give employees time to adapt during the weekend I would advise you to fire your HR team or whoever that gave you this bright idea. All this does is ruin your employees’ rest as they unnecessarily panic. We often do not know what goes on amongst the management and what are their plans (to be fair they probably have no idea what they are doing either) – we are just supposed to execute. Which would be fine but often times the decisions made are irrational and a waste of donor money. By the way town halls are not an answer – nobody wants to sit through 3 hours long town halls.    Here’s a special shout out to the HR team: Nobody trusts you. Nobody. Let’s not even talk about protecting the staff. Let’s just talk about how you fail even at the core tenets of your jobs. Number 1: hiring the right person for the role. More often than not scummy people are hired (even to your own team) and they can’t even do their jobs right. At one point we even had a HR head that does not know or bother to learn our local labour laws. Granted that he is now gone but the fact that he was ever hired proves how incompetent this team and by large the management team is. Number 2: career progression. The lack of progression amongst the junior staff is extremely concerning. Pair this up with the phenomenon where you see incidences of expats > locals being promoted to senior/managerial positions; you get a ticking time bomb. Why are your employees constantly forced to jump through so many hoops to be promoted? If they are already doing above and beyond what their JD is shouldn’t this be cause for promotion?? Why the over emphasis on the number of years of work exp/services? Why are you not evaluating based on competency and achievements? 3: Employee retention. In the first quarter of the year the number of people leaving this organisation is in the double digits and this does not seem like it will end. Isn’t this high time to take a good hard look at yourself and admit where you are screwing up? It’s not hard you can dig up the recent exit interviews.   Double standards. New employees are expected to have the necessary skills/knowledge to do their jobs when they are hired. Afterwards they have a probation period to evaluate and confirm that they know how to do their jobs. I don’t think this requirement is being imposed on our management. We have seen two CEOs now that do not know or understand conservation work despite the fact that they have been in position for about a YEAR. We have seen directors that frankly speaking do not know what conservation is as well. While we do not expect them to possess deep technical knowledge it is disturbing that they don’t even understand the bigger picture or what their team is doing. BY THE WAY your staff knows when you are fluffing. We say nothing because we don’t want to get fired. Just know that is incredibly frustrating because it makes us wonder – why on earth are you paid at this level when you can’t deliver? Educate yourself and stop wasting our time and the organisation’s money.   I can go on and on but I am exhausted. We all are which is why we are all leaving one by one. Good luck to all who enter I do not wish this place on my worst enemy.",0.998242,0.0015957513,0.00016215215

YaleNUS College is a unique opportunity in that it is a very selective higher education institution but there is still ample space for new hires to join and shape the institution. The opportunity to work in such a multicultural office space and have a vision for higher education that is leading edge is something you can not find almost anywhere else in the industry. If you are mission based and share the strategic goals of the institution it is easy to jump 100% and work for the good of the community and institution.,0.00048316934,0.00055124494,0.9989656
As with any new institution the opportunity to shape and develop policy and projects abound. If you are simply looking to do the minimum or are not excited by working with a moral mission in mind then this may not be the place for you. As the community feels as though it is working for global change and to support the students the work ethic pushes many beyond the average standard of work. It is a wonderful experience but something to be aware of for those who are not looking to devote beyond the standard 9 to 5.,0.090756424,0.83466136,0.07458229

Combining Eastern and Western traditions in the Common Curriculum is pretty unique for example  Faculty housing for nonSingaporean faculty is close to work and heavily subsidized.
