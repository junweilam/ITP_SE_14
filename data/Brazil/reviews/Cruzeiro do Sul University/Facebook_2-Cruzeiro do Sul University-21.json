My skills and work have always been recognized and respected.\r\nI had an excellent opportunity there where I could work from home and have a better work and life balance and I am very thankful to the company for many opportunities they gave me to grow.  But I understand that it is not a common practice to everyone.\r\nLocation: very close to the subway station (5 min) but on the red line (east zone) which is the busiest one.  So depending on where you live it can be a great location easy to access or very far.", "cons": "For those who are CLT contract at the IT department usually people work 9h instead of 8h per day and the benefits are very low. \r\nThe IT department is groing very fast but the general mindset of other departments tends to be   old and out of date which can be a problem sometimes depending on which project you are working if you need to interact with them."}]]
