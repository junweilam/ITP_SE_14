Terrible bullying and vindictiveness from management.  No support for teachers facing challenging classes. The catch all 'solution' was to manage teachers out as soon as possible rather than management doing their jobs and developing teachers through training.  Management there are lazy and corrupt.,0.9988856,0.0009633849,0.00015105392
I worked at the Gutech for almost two years. This university treats her staff very well. They are professional kind and very generous. The campus is beautiful and welcoming. I had a wonderful experience with the head of Gubridge Mr RK Nair and the HR department under the direction of Ms. Hind and her wonderful assistant Ms. Shamsa. I hadn't the possibility to meet the rector in person Mr Alsalmi however in all his correspondences and meetings he was very kind professional respectful and humble. I recommend this institution to all teachers and students.,0.00041820863,0.0005694267,0.99901235

They stopped even pretending to be a university. Marks are all inflated and in many cases entirely fraudulent. Course materials assignments and examinations are not even high school level. Cheating is rampant and condoned by management. Management refuses to spend a dime on necessary resources. Salaries are getting slashed. Unpaid overtime is the norm. Students suffer from abysmal employment opportunities upon graduation as it is a degree mill. Morale among staff and students is zero. A depressing hopeless place.,0.99917054,0.0006648205,0.00016464565
