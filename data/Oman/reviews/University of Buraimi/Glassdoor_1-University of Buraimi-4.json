Marks are all inflated and in many cases entirely fraudulent. Course materials, assignments and examinations are not even high school level. Cheating is rampant and condoned by management. Management refuses to spend a dime on necessary resources. Salaries are getting slashed. Unpaid overtime is the norm. Students suffer from abysmal employment opportunities upon graduation as it is a degree mill. Morale among staff and students is zero. A depressing, hopeless place."}]]
