Each trimester ALL the scheduling for teachers is done impossibly lastminute to the point that you find out your teaching schedule literally a few hours before you must start teaching each class.  Each trimester the schedule completely changed as would each level taught  from business english to 6 year olds to testprep without warning and little predictability. Teachers were regularly given 12hour shifts with four different levels in a day with an hour for lunch and not even a refrigerator to use. Teachers are left to prepare in their off time and it is not under consideration that some classes take a lot of time to prepare for (such as testprep collegelevel maths) and some little but no pay differences are considered. Classes are capped at 20 participants even with small children which is about 8 too many to do a good job. This system is kept to maximize profit but does so at the cost of the quality of teaching and the quality of life of staff. The overhired so few got the hours they were promised.,0.9987795,0.0010490537,0.00017144991
