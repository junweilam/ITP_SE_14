Teachers were regularly given 12-hour shifts with four different levels in a day with an hour for lunch and not even a refrigerator to use. Teachers are left to prepare in their off time and it is not under consideration that some classes take a lot of time to prepare for (such as test-prep college-level maths) and some little, but no pay differences are considered. Classes are capped at 20 participants, even with small children, which is about 8 too many to do a good job. This system is kept to maximize profit but does so at the cost of the quality of teaching and the quality of life of staff.
