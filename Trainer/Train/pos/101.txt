1. Business China is such an amazing place!!! If you are good at curry favour this is the perfect platform to shine! 2. Many opportunities to get into close contact with politicians businessmen but it all depends on your department and your direct boss who might just cut off all your connections and simply make you do all the hard work. 3. Office building is new although all the furnitures are old with the exception of those in top management office. 4. Supervisors who are even more concern about you than your parents. They get anxious once you ainâ€™t in their bird eye view and you will receive text from them asking â€œwhere are you?â€. Such love and concern isnâ€™t?
