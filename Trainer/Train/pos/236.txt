Benefits are really great better than all restructured hospitals in S'pore as of now. Worklife balance is adequate having to take leave w/o pressure as long as you can priorities your work. My learning experience is challenging yet fulfilling but this depends on the bosses you meet. Promotion is based on meritocracy system which is fair.
