ASEF is a unique organisation and working for it is also a rather unique experience. Being apolitical but working with governments brings its own challenges as well as opportunities. While bureaucracy is definitely there and could (as well as should) be diminished overall ASEF offers their employees a great level of liberty and responsibility to take ownership of the projects they run. The team is small so each staff member has to step up in order for the organisation as a whole to continue evolving and improving (i.e. if you're just looking for any 95 job to put bread on the table without an actual interest in ASEF's vision and mission this is most probably not for you). And yes you will most probably end up working a lot. But yes you will also be inspired and gratified by the work itself your colleagues your partners your participants and other stakeholders. Only you can assess if the significant efforts you will need to put in are worth your time and dedication. If you believe it is please give it a try.
