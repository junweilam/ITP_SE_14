The work is meaningful interesting and varied. Colleagues are generally friendly and helpful. The office in Singapore is in a very cool building with nice spaces and many meeting rooms. Good medical coverage and bonus plan. The CEO is a master visionary with a great deal of empathy and knowledge the only true leader in the entire senior management team (with a few exceptions especially those based outside of Singapore).
