While being a new joiner (<3mths) in the People Excellence function I could sense the strong passion that clearly permeates every function. Management team and even the support functions exhibit impressive passion for their role. It's a place with lots of potential for growth given the mission of the Organisation. Management supports Job Rotation and Internal Lateral moves which is a great way for retaining youths to explore their career aspiration and development. Reasonably good benefits compared to other SMEs/ Non Profit. It is a place that value and require Team Success. Individuals who are focus on own agenda/KPIs and running their own race may not be a good help in building the team/ organisation's success.
