Nice warm working environment with superiors very patient and willing to teach new comers the ropes. Certain flexibility is allowed (case to case basis). Good systems in force for all staff. Staff welfare & benefits is good. Good learning ground for fresh grads or new comers who are looking at having a long term career working in the children related services or social work arena. Lots of other job opportunities available within the organization itself.
