Very stressful due to lean manpower. HR doesn't bother to hire new staff because they can 'save cost'. When colleagues on leave have to do 2person workload. Higher management only talks about how to maximise profit and not lose money. Too much Christian 'religion' stuff. Weekly 'devotions' monthly 'church attendances'. How about spending this money to hire more staff? Keep talking about faith but actually only care about money. NonChristians will not get promotion because they are not oriented with the company 'Christian' values.
