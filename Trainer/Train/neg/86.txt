1. Not for people who want to do real work since the management have no directions or leadership skills required to run the organization. 2. Change of top management almost every two years so even if you are great at bootlicking it will reset to zero every two to three years. 3. Company tends to scout highly paid yet incapable midmanagement who loves to take credit for their subordinatesâ€™ work. When anything goes wrong itâ€™s all the minionsâ€™ fault. 4. Pay is below market rate for junior staffs with minimal increments. Income gap between junior staffs and management is enormous. 5. Promotion purely based on favoritism. Apparently nondeserving staffs get the most recognition. If you show that you OT very often (even if you come in at 10am and do nothing during working hours) but just because you OT itâ€™s considered going the extra miles!! So remember to check your emails every night till 12am you will definitely be seen as someone very proactive! 6. A very toxic culture with office politics even more exciting than our TVB HK drama. 7. Definitely a training ground for Star Awards leading actress/actor including one that bangs the table another that accuse cleaner of stealing stuff etc
