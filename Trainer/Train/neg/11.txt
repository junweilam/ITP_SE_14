Green space behind the building where you can see the wild monkeys. Inside the building you can see the circus animals (pro tip: betterbehaved wildlife in the Singapore zoo) Some managers are moonlighting because they're bored. Actual work takes little time and there is no IT screening of computer use. So you can do whatever you want. Office politics is easy to maneuver but so timeconsuming and superchildish: 1) nonseconded directors think they're the ones holding up the place and want to be congratulated for doing their job (so tell them how fantastic and hard working they are exactly like Joan of Arc) seconded directors don't want to hear problems so send them on foreign travels away from actual work stuff. 2) There are camps which plot against against each other (for no reason maybe camp A person didnt go for lunch with camp B person) join each camp and agree with everything. Then go do exactly what you want and blame it on other sides when they complain. 3) For promotion/bonus time: be visible and sing the praises of everyone in the management team. EVERY ONE. Since the discussions happen on a vote basis in closeddoor management meetings consensus on how many people like you is the basis (there is no rationale really since there is no understanding of professional performance management). You'll get a promotion if they like you not on your actual work performance. Salaries are not transparent either; the pay scale they use is for optics only.... there is space to grow and you can earn a decent salary if you use the tips above (you're welcome!) Come to ASEF and coast.
