This is a family business and everyone in the top management are related. Culture is the school is very bad and there is no trust from the top management to all their staffs. Micromanagement is rampant in this school. First year of employment only have 10 days of leave. If you pass your probation before Chinese New Year you'll be forced to clear 5 to 7 days of leave during this period. If not you must take 10 days of No Pay Leave. During school holidays we are forced to clear leave. If we have not enough leave we must take No Pay Leave. There are a lot of teachers (especially IGCSE and Primary school teachers) who only survive with half month of pay every year during June and December holiday. During normal school days when you have free period you may be forced to take leave. Cross deployment of teachers within the various campuses ever though it is not allowed. Those who took grab or taxi will be reimbursed but those who drive their own car will not be reimbursed. School sack staffs at whim. It is very common to see someone today and the next day they are gone. No appreciation to staffs. HR will turn nasty once you decided to leave the place. Some staffs were threatened to sign an agreement to forfeit their pay when they were asked to leave immediately. The school also threatened to withhold the final salary of some teachers even though it is against the law. School will ask teachers to be strict with students but once the student complain they will side the students and reprimand or even sack the teachers. No 13th month bonus or end of year bonus or any bonuses.
