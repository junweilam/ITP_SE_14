Although a new DG and Board Chair are starting their tenures and both seem committed to addressing the many serious issues left behind by the departing DG the corrosive inept egodriven senior leadership team remains in place. Over the past month (since the DG left) Senior Leadership have been making increasingly reckless selfserving organisationharming decisions some in direct conflict with the IB's own financial safeguards and internal policies. Management of the serious issues around exams during the time of COVID remains wellintentioned but tenuous with far too much depending upon the good will of dedicated overworked midlevel and junior staff. Programme integrity is seriously threatened as is the organisation's reputation; these threats will grow even greater should things proceed as they have ben going. While there is every hope that the organisation will turn around under the incoming leadership unless the remaining members of the senior leadership team are investigated and removed or reprimanded for their long individual and collective histories of poor decision making policy breaking bullying and in one very unfortunate case harassment the IB will remain a bad place to work.
