Pays well below market for nonteaching roles (especially if you are nonrevenue generating) particularly in support departments. Poor prospects for internal progression (no internal promotions) though lateral transfers are possible. Not attractive for young executives looking for quick career growth. If you're not moving up after 23 years move out or you may find yourself stuck.
