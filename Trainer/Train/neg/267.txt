High turnover u will realized they are constantly recruiting lecturers Low salary their pay is as good as giving tuition to pri/sec students so think twice Low standard student mainly from china whom are very difficult to teach and arrogant Bad management very bad/rude/unorganized backend operations admins are constantly changing as well As a lecturer you are to do all study/teaching materials lesson plan and all the paperwork stuff (Write reports admin matters do materials for their overseas programme that you are not even teaching) FT lecturer are overloaded with too much nonteaching related work PT lecturer are overloaded with work such as setting papers lesson plan teaching material (NOTE: you will not be paid for all this additional stuff you are paid for the no. of teaching hours only) Don't expect any help in this organization you are on your own. Micromanaging from academic admin like to peep and come into your class for no reason Many lecturers left abruptly due to heated tension with management Students = Customers = King so just imagine your position as lecturer in this school. I would even give this 1 star but the system wouldn't allow me to process.
