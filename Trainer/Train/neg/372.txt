They expect full commitment for a low salary. The direct supervisor comes in several times a day and requests spontaneous meetings or alternatively blows off meetings that one has prepared for. Trust in employees' capabilities is low. Criticism rate is high even when they are genuinely satisfied. Administration is giving out misinformation with regard to bonuses and makes it sound as if everyone receives them but that is not true. Four people left during my time of employment which should have given me an indication that it is not a workplace where people last long.
