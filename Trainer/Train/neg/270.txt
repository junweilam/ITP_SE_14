It is hell. Lots of office politics with Lecturers treated as trash (by the management and by the students). Family run business so if you join your boot licking skill needs to be on par. Salary increment is for those who boot licks the best and able to â€œmonkey see monkey doâ€. Positive comments here are either from the management or from the boot lickers themselves who have worked long enough and given preferential treatment. However if you always feel that for every company you work for you cannot find job satisfaction you are encouraged to join here. Because once you join you will realise that you have been too self entitled and the next company after this will definitely meet your criteria.
