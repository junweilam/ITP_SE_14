not well paid for the amount of work that comes with it. Marking of work is expected but at a part time level I was tasked with setting and vetting of exam scripts. Clearly abuse the use of their part timers. This is clearly more of the full timers scope of work. Because I am asked to do it outside of work hours (which is just the teaching) We are expected to return the stationeries we use that is issued by the school.
