Think twice before you accept the job offer or even apply. Turnover is damn high until you don't even get the chance to know some of the colleagues before they leave. Everyday will have new things come to you and you will definitely feel that you are teacher admin and security for this school. Forced leave is the most ridiculous thing that I have encountered in this school. One more thing is the teachers are always the last person being informed about any decision made by the team. This means that the teachers will only get to know the latest updates when the parents message them for clarification.
