The problem with ASEF is that it seems to reset itself to Zero every 4 years when the top management changes which is a total mess if I may be blunt. Our leadership are seconded highlevel diplomats. This means that while they may have the best of intentions to effect positive change they are not necessarily the trained professionals needed in managing a uniquely structured and everevolving nonprofit. They need strategic and operational help but alas they are surrounded by incompetent people in their immediate support team. This combined with 7 heads of departments with conflicting interests results in a circus. Internal procedures are a mess rules are nonexistent and lobbying for selfpreservation is abound. The worst part is that the staff in the Managerial level and below (Executives and Officers) suffer because of the mess on top. Work load is increased unnecessarily. So much time is spent pushing paper. On top of that there is no appreciation for staff apart from nice words of validation and empty and broken promises for positive organisational change and career progression. There is no growth in this place it's just fighting fire every single day. Further the overperformers are not only expected but demanded to make up for the shortcomings of those who do not pull their weight. This results in burnout overall dissatisfaction and a loss of morale since the performance appraisal system is a big joke and underperforming staff are protected for optics and a socalled healthy head count. Senior management encourages people to "grow" and learn other skills/other roles within the organisation but when one shifts from programme management to operations to fill a gap it is not recognised as a significant contribution actually it becomes detriment for the rewards/promotions/salary increments because the programme people are valued more than the people who make their programmes happen. There is a lot of overtime in ASEF and this is not compensated. Mental wellbeing of people suffer too. The current senior management has open doors and staff do approach them with grievances but there is zero action to remedy various problems. Because of all this drama if you are are looking for a normal 96 job with acceptable work/life balance forget this place. If you are looking to be compensated for your worth forget this place. If you despise admin work run far far away. Any role in ASEF is approx 80% admin/pushing paper around.
