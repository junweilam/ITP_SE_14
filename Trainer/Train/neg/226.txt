no permanent desk space in the office poor working relationships with colleagues. You receive emails from "Academic Team X" giving you instructions but you don't even know your colleague's name face or whether or not they are teaching or admin staff. you will be asked to do many things outside of your classroom time and will not be compensated for it. The contract clause that you will fulfill "all ancillary duties assigned to you" is not worth the low salary you will be receiving.
