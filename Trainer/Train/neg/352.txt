The management don't treat you as equal you are just a tool to make things done. To make things worse they had the wrong idea about data science plus they have their Finance ego which they think they are awesome. This combination makes working so hard you won't get recognized doing the right thing or you need to spend lots of time persuade them to accept the right way. Based on this your work won't easily get recognized to the extend you. The management just don't respect your craft to the extend you. They had big plans but they don't recognize the scale of the project hence no proper resource planning time planning. You end up doing things alone in a tight schedule to meet ridiculous deadline you need to make sacrifice and compromise and in the end you won't get recognized. If you see a problem and wants to do something about it such as build something to facilitate future work you also won't get recognized and will be treated as useless. The management don't have the vision. Even the pay is good you as a data scientist you won't improve your skill very much you gradually lose touch with what is going on out there. It is a small company but the hierarchy is not necessarily tall. Everyone and everything is run by CEO himself and the management are voice pipes. This makes things very slow. Career wise there is no 1on1 session between your boss or if there is it will be useless as your boss doesn't know anything about your skill. There is also no career progression as well. Work life balance well during working hours your time and energy is wasted on dealing with useless matters they also expect to see the result so you need to work on your own time to delivery then explain your work to them later.
