Its so bad here. Staff welfare is zero. Leave is bad. CCL I have to apply one month in advance. Ownself give holiday and take from our annual leave. Whole experience is bad. Turnover rate of teachers is super high. Month of June almost 12 of us left at the same time. School holidays teachers are not paid but yet payment is collected from every student without fail during school holidays. Teachers are very little in the school. Relief load is super high. Most of the time you spend doing duties that are redundant.
