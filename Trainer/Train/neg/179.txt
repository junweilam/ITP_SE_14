Unappreciated by management. Often they find fault in staff rather than the system. More often is they side more to doctors than nurses. We must look after doctors and when any incident occurs then it's often the nurses fault. Promotion for those who are bad in unctuous. This is a polite word to say extreme flattery for the upper management. Favouritism is rampant those who are like me won't move forward on the career path. Group are formed and are lead by certain upper management and politics are everywhere.
