Bias from the management and favorism is in play. Bad managment only try to look good for themselves regard the wellbeing of the employee. Poor project managment management will keep taking all the workload even it is not their area just to please bosses and let team struggle. Talk only do nothing. managment will said one thing today and change completely next day.
