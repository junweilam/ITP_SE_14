poor salary in the local context there is no career progression there is no talent pipeline there is no training needs analysis there is no identification of high potentials and talent is lost to competitors. vacancies are hired externally while internal staff gets no support to grow/develop/upgrade. zero opportunity to take on senior roles internally because such roles are usually give to external hires or UK expats. annual batch recruitment exercise is conducted for senior roles across the world and such roles are perceived to be generally reserved for UK expats only because it is basically a merrygoround between the selected few. such opportunities or batch type exercise is not provided to junior level management or even executives and middle management. company is quickly becoming top heavy and bottom lean and inverted triangle. expanding regional teams while cutting manpower in operational and business support units teaching centres making a huge loss. poor hr practices. processes and procedures move at a glacial pace.
