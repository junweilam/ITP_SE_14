Flexible working hours for me although this is similar in the UK/Aus as well. This is also highly dependent on the PI. If you have a Singaporean PI be prepared to work like a slave. People are mostly friendly and are helpful but some people (PIs) have their nose up the sky when they walk and donâ€™t say thanks when someone else opens the door on the way in/out.
