No matter what position you're holding it doesn't matter because the job scope and task is not related. Case of blamed others is always happened. No one will 'try' to understand your situation but will give you ridiculous deadline or excuse such as "human error". Some of the management will judge you but not base on your performance. The politic are CREATED happened or not is just a drama. No secret can keep within a day and also in between of different campus. Truth or not management will pick whatever they want/like to know.
