No longer a beacon of education in language teaching and teacher training. Sh upper management and a school now run by sales and marketing rather than an academic team. Teachers told to give feedback as nothng more than a boxticking exercise. No one heeds any input from teachers or Senior Academic Staff. More interested in bums on seats even if those seats are filled with highly disruptive dysfunctional SEN students who should not be given a place. Even midmanagement is willing to sacrifice the 10+ other students' right to a calm focused learning environment if it means keeping the money paid by the uberSEN's parents. 'Kids won't really complain about it will they ? We only see them once a week' think management. Disgusting. Furthermore the organization has been eviscerated from within by poor management decisions and bullshittery involving cookiecutter approach to centres across the globe. No longer teaching to the local context. Sinking ship that started losing it's identity preCovid.
