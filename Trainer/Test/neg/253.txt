I was most shocked and flabbergasted when they taught me how to alter and edit documents for the sake of audit. This is a school an education facility for goodness sake. How can you teach stuff like this ?? Totally not moral. Btw they will whistle blow to higher management if they want you out of the campus but have no reasonable reason to do so. This staff abhors mingling between colleagues (whether that is between or within depts). She LOVES to micromanage and violate your personal life as well. She wanted to check a staffâ€™s personal phone as the staff did not reply to her messages AFTER WORKING HOURS mind youâ€¦ Working in the admin dept your job scope is ONLY documentation and filling for students (all the way back to 2019). Even if you request for alternative tasks they will not give it to you. As they will criticize and have concluded you as someone who canâ€™t even do the simplest thing â€“ so what makes you capable of doing other tasks. After working there for a week I can see that they totally DO NOT bother to try to consistently update and maintain their records. Instead they pressured the new parttimers to finish it. And if the parttimers did not reach the target they will shame you in front of other colleagues. It is genuinely hard to hit the target as they are so inconsistent that you have to constantly do corrections for the same file multiple times (which is so demotivating and depressing).
