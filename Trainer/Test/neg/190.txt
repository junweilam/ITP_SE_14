I worked here in 2016 thinking that with my experience and communication skills from working in NHS hospitals I would be able to bring something to the department. However I have never been more unhappy felt less valued and more alien in a team than at Changi. The senior staff were closed minded and couldnâ€™t seem to step away from any protocols that existed to take in ideas from the international staff or anybody else for that matter. Common sense in this hospital is very uncommon and all clinical reasoning goes out of the window... if itâ€™s not part of the protocol then â€œcan notâ€. The manual handling techniques were dangerous and I couldnâ€™t understand how more staff didnâ€™t injure their backs in the process as no equipment was ever used. The more established staff were more interested in saving face than supporting their junior staff and on more than one occasion I was wrongly blamed for errors of my â€œseniorâ€ staff. The communication within the team was poor notably the team I worked in were unapproachable and actually harvested an environment that meant that asking questions was avoided at all costs as you were made to feel stupid for this a terribly dangerous situation for patients to be in and an environment that stunts all staff learning opportunities. The case load expected of staff including junior staff was extremely high and language barriers were not taken in to account. There are many more negative points to working here but I donâ€™t have the inclination to waste anymore time talking about this hospital as it was the worst nine months of my life. I knew many expats who also worked in my team and they mostly hated it.
