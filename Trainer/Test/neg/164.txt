However traditional hierarchical culture exist in organisation resulting to retention of some unprofessional senior directors/staff in organisation whom might emotional abuse/ bully staff especially towards entry level staff who are unaware of their rights.

HR is also unable to pick up/address such cases due to lack of anonymity of staff.
