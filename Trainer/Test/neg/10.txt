IF YOU ARE STAFF: idealistic and committed when you arrive prepare to be drowned by meaningless tasks as well as lastminute requests (taken for granted no personal boundaries). As admin work occupies most of your day you will dedicate plenty of extra hours to project work. CONSULTANT/VENDOR: prepare for 90's bureaucracy and processes. You can charge the highest rates as you are expected to solve a big organisational mess. PARTICIPANT: you will have a one time opportunity to network. It will take several months for ASEF to reimburse you. PARTNER: weak reporting system so you will barely know what ASEF does with your resources. If you earmark funds your logo will be present that's all. Only interesting because of your countributions. FRIEND: all the privileges you ask for 0 responsibilities HR rules don't apply to you. You don't need to do anything written in your fancy job description (just personal chauffeur or clapping pet). SENIOR MANAGEMENT (PROFESSIONAL): power/drama hungry individuals that would be immediately fired anywhere else but here. SENIOR MANAGEMENT (APPOINTED): lack of professionalism or contact with reality. They look to another side when problems arise only interested in their personal agenda and future postings. IF YOU WANT IMPACT especially in the long term RECOGNITION of good practices EMPOWERMENT as a worker (or just being listened) Please consider other job prospects as you will not find this here. But suppose you don't mind working for unrespectful and entitled bosses or gradually losing your value in the job market (or your health and mental wellbeing). In that case ASEF is the place to be.
