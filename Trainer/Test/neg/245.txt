Nepotism and favoritism. It's a family business. If you're not related please do not join. There are so many incompetent people in position. No bonus benefits appreciation or whatsoever for staff. You're nothing but a tool. There are no prospect so join at your own risk or if you'd love to waste time. Know your worth. Useless management system. Pointless and illogical procedures. Your pay is still by cheque. How outdated can it get? Place feels like a third world country. Everything is dirty old or rundown.
