Lack of academic integrity and authenticity even when you bring it to managers attention High staff turnover You spend more time assessing a students paper giving feedback yet the student never sees the feedback poor productivity. Middle management micro manage to the point it appears they are stalking you Lack of autonomy Payment by cheque yes in 2018! On a few occasions payment was late meaning you had to wait longer to go to the bank to process then wait for the funds to clear. Old out dated facilities Extra admin tasks required to do withing 1 days notice during teaching hours Extremely difficult to get time off even with 6 months in advance They create a toxic culture where creativity and appreciation are not regarded.
