Very political beware of continuous bullying and harassment by the senior management. Be careful with those who had been there for a long time and HR seems to be doing nothing too. Lack of leadership. There is a high degree of favouritism and unfair treatment/compensation. Promotion pay raise and career progression are always unfair here.
