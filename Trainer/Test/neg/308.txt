HR is a huge problem. Ironically the department is unprofessional to say the least other than not being productive or responsive. Whistle blowers within DukeNUS don't get protected information gets leaked to the miscreant and the bullying gets worse. Under a professional setting all the highly unacceptable behaviours are getting brushed under the rug as "lab mismanagement" unless you are being physically or sexually assaulted. Anything leading up to but short of that will be filed under mismanagement and you may very well lose your employment because you stood up for yourself. Gifting is not a common practice but as there are no strict rules regarding this it has been observed that people who frequently provide gifts seem to escape any form of repercussion from being unprofessional. There are no guidelines on promotion you could be in the same lab for 10 years and remain as an ordinary RA or RF or your direct supervisor could be your friend outside of work and you'll get promoted within a year. Publication is an issue as well whoever gets the PI's ear will get dips on half completed work just to finish off some tail end bits to acheieve a first author paper. Your RAs get hijacked by the very same people. It's a dog eat dog environment. Lab safetey is an issue with this much neglegience going on people leaving mice carcess in the fume hood liquid nitrogen tanks not shut properly 4 degree room door getting jammed (users having difficulty getting out of the room). Unless you have a stringent floor manager your life in the lab will be very trying.
