The immature and incompetent management in Singapore believe they are a top school in AsiaPacific. Apart from a couple of good Profs the teaching and research is abysmal. Most students in Asia aren't even aware of the existence of the campus in Singapore. The only way the Asia campus can survive is by receiving students from the French campus. None of the Singapore based programmes reach the target number of students reducing the quality. Senior management have no strategy and fire middle management to shift the blame. Careers service for students is very poor also. This is a terrible place to work or study.
