Run by one person and his ideologies so it's his way or the highway! Poorly managed and toxic work culture with office politics. No compensation or benefits. Out of 10 days Annual Leave seven (7) days is forcefully taken for Chinese New Year holidays and you are left with three (3) days for the whole year. HR department will minus your salary as and when they wish as per their calculations please check and verify with them when needed. Extremely high turnover! I have met people who worked for a day and left. It is really that bad here and the management fails to acknowledge this problem.
