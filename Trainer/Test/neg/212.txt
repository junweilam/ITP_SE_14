0 incentives can you imagine the first day of work your colleague just told you all the negative things about this company instead of the positive ones? that's how this school's tradition started HR/management doesn't care about existing staffs which leads to the first point provide nothing except for your staff pass and markers. Laptop/Ipad for teaching you need to have 1 yourself basically hard work doesn't pays off here. teachers turnover rate are high. I do see teachers leaving between 16 months. teachers who stayed longer doesn't have much benefits except for a low pay increment HR/management always will find ways to make sure whatever benefits you try to fight for will always end up in their favor instead of yours
