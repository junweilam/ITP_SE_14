1) NPO don't expect a competitive remuneration despite your workloads being comparable to those in the civil service or stat boards 2) Weak enforcement of organisational vision and incoherent management structure that is constantly hijacked by the top brass 3) CEO changes every two years or so lack of continuity 4) Despite being lean and relatively nonbureaucratic politics among management trickle downwards which don't receive due attention or effort to stem 5) For fresh grads not a recommended first job as you don't get to develop specific industryrelevant skillsets apart from event management perhaps 6) Workloads are pretty heavy for a NPO that pays relatively poorly as you may get arrowed with adhoc tasks and projects that do not contribute to org vision such as "staffing"
