There is an overall lack of tenacity to fulfil important organisation goals. If you come from the private or public sector be prepared for a lot of frustration when you experience a culture that accepts ambiguity and contradiction. You will realise that work meetings tend to drag very long because of their unsaid belief in consensual leadership. If any leaders were to give a directive the culture is such that there will be a lot of negativity towards leadership and the leadership feels compelled to attend to each individual or if frustrated say something that invites more controversy to force a buyin. If you are coming in as a middle management and above be very prepared for a longdrawn battles. The voices of the younger generation of staff (millenials) and the oldest generation of staff will be the loudest. Lastly certain departments are very overworked: campus department (due to lack of manpower) missions department (due to the launch of many missions projects) and HR department (due to lack of proper HRtrained personnel to handle the work). If you are going to work in these three departments be prepared. Due to work load and long hours the staff members in these 3 departments fall sick very often.
