The management has no idea how to run a school. People who are currently working there are unhappy with the rude and very bossy attitude of the management and as a result they can not perform to their utmost. The management is trying to overwork the staff and never says 'thank you' for the efforts people working there are making. Further more there are no end of year bonuses and the employees are not allowed to take leaf whenever they want.
