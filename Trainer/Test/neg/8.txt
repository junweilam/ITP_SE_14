1. Management is domineering 2. Pathetic career development in some roles. Some staff are mere figureheads. They have no significant responsibilities. 3. Straightforward processes are complicated by hiring multiple people to do sub processes of the main process. Some jobs can be successfully completed by one employee but multiple people are hired which creates great confusion. 4. Lots of cliques. 5. People who review the performance of their department are often not aware of what an employee is doing. Leads to great misunderstandings. 6. Some people hired in major positions are complete misfits leading to great problems for those dealing with them.
