The HR is absolutely incompetent lurking around trying to catch you at every opportunity. The HR rules don't make any sense in the 21st century especially postpandemic. Blatant disregard for personal life and private information. The HR is suspicious and does not offer trust as they claim. People get fired for trivial matters on an hour's notice. Senior management doesn't care about any of this. To them you're dispensable any words saying otherwise are just sweet lies and typical corporate nonsense. These practices affect the entire organisation and I'm hearing from a lot of my colleagues who basically fear the HR but would stay quiet because of the fear of being fired. Some of the things I've heard from the HR are straight up lies.
