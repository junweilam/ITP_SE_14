Management ignores demands of employees (e.g. regarding need for additional staff better salary enhanced worklife balance). Petty office politics: employees marginalised and ostracised by other employees over petty disputes childish plotting against one another. Ineffective HR department: slow ignores employees' complaints and demands. Extra hours rarely taken into account (and thus unpaid). Disregard for employees' mental health and wellbeing. Most projects amount to the equivalent of throwing (thousands) of coins into a fountain and praying for a supreme being to grant you a wish: no reviews about the impact of projects incredibly expensive closeddoors conferences do not seem to produce any concrete results apart from being networking opportunities for (relatively randomly selected) participants. Refusal to evaluate reconsider and change working methods even when they clearly fail to produce results.
