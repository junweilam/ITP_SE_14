Well No 1 is the staffs. Team Leaders who LOVES to order you around and GETS MAD wen u dun clean up their wards be it smething before or after u cover. DAMN AUNTIES POLITICS! not surprise even the younger ones too! theyll be all smiles and ask how ure doin but theyll simply talk bhind ur back in d wards or during lunch. PH or leaves nearing Raya will be given to those who have children yes i can understand but come on EVERY YEAR?? so people tat dun hav children DONT HAVE FAMILIES?? DONT HAVE ELDERLY TO SPENT IT WITH?? "special treatment" is given to those who follow their masters and in return nothing of their actions is being questioned. doesnt value ur hardwork only wen u did d slightiest mistakes the world seems about to end! d superiors ALWAYS have this love hate relationship with bmu staffs. Forever and ever. Nurses can choose which patient to b admitted to their wards. theyll gve d psas their black face and starts complainin wen thres a odd discipline in their wards or complicated case. Simple as sayin those psas in HIGH HEELS & A MOUNTAIN OF MAKEUP are just simply d rejected air stewardess or dreamin " trying" to be one. Girl wrong place!
