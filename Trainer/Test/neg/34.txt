Management has changed and the work environment is now toxic. The management team has a shallow understanding of what they are doing and has regressed to issues explored over 4 yrs ago without actually reviewing or valuing past findings and experiences. The environment is toxic because elements are now clambering to claim credit for things they have not done or lay blame on other people. Organisational memory has been lost forgetting what strategic partner entities have been contributing out of goodwill in the past and blind to the real value of what partner entities can contribute in the future. Management has been so bad that all their midlevel executional managers have left in the last 6 months and close to half of their on the ground staff have left and more are in the process of looking to leave. New management has only been in place officially for less than 6 months. But hey it may be a strategy to get rid of "old blood" right? Or just plain simple mismanagement. Many people who work at SCAPE are not there for the money salary is pretty low so for them to throw in the towel it says alot about what they are putting up with. SCAPE now chases after shallow wayang KPIs and media sexy stuff which is scary for a government supported and directed entity. Instead of looking deeper and dealing with the real issues that affect youths in Singapore which it used to have a heart for it now focuses on hitting "KPIs" which help them look good to the various government agencies and personas they report to. Examples would include: 1. Measuring youth engagement by counting social media likes or incentivising people to fill out forms so they have have numbers to show the brass. They are already aware of better ways to do this and should know real engagement comes from tracking loyalty which they might be worried to expose to the brass. 2. There is a shallow drive to pull in "sexy" topics like A.I. robots and vending machine retail concepts just because it looks and sounds good at this point in time. There is no deeper thought to how this integrates back to youth outreach engagement and capability building.
