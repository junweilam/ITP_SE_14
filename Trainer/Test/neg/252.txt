Literally nothing. The staff in the admin dept are all newcomers. There is literally no one you can turn to for help. The only senior staff in the dept canâ€™t handle stress. She will not answer your questions and the admin head is too busy spying on the staff using the security cameras (with the sound system installed). Those that are knowledgeable in the job scopes in admin dept have already been left.
