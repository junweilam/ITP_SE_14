Lack of progression no rotation of some directors leading some departments with only managers. Also expect to wait years before being "rewarded" with promotion Management doesnt listen or pretends to listen without trying to understand leading to "solutions" that only make sitations worst Bullying of subordinates happen very frequently (and not even hidden everyone knows who's toxic yet they are there more than a decade) Incapable/ineffective/inefficient colleagues protected some even with significantly better salaries than others Toxic culture
