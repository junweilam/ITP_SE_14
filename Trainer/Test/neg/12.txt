Where to start? During my time nepotism bullying and gossip was the order of the day. BY THE LEADERSHIP; most of the midlevel and junior staff are actually okay. Many of the unpaid interns were relatives/friends of kids of the directors; management hired friends to take on consultancies organisational budget spent on hosting wives' gatherings or beautifying offices. The most unprofessional of leaders (2016 2021) surrounded by the most sycophantic of advisors who traded morals and decency for permanent positions or pay rises or dubious promotions where people clearly unsuited for the role were moved to new positions overnight. For those who disagreed they were summarily dismissed. If anything goes wrong the lowest person in the food chain is blamed for the problem. These issues of unprofessional behavior have always existed in ASEF (at varying levels of idiocy) and will probably always exist. Diplomats are accountable to their countries not to this organization so unless they already have good values there is no check on corruption and powerhungry egos. Many forget they're no longer running embassies. Some professional directors have been here for so long and in so many roles that they are unable to see how the world has left this outdated organisation behind; HBR articles aren't the best source of management unless you can reflect on how your own actions bring an organization down. There is a 0 accountability structure. The new ED is doomed because by the time he can get support from his own advisors (and some of them will be actively plotting against him if he corrects their behavior) and gain consensus from 53 member board his posting will be over and a new diplomat from somewhere else will come in and do the same thing. You'll learn new skills in people management but you'll give your mental health away. Flip through the 2018 and 2020 annual report to see how many people have changed.
