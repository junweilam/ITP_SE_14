INEPT MANAGEMENT Management/ Aministration live in their world; they don't listen. I complained about the conduct of some MOs and attitude of some nurses but there was no action. Management/ Aministration sit in their observatory high tower; they don't care. They dismissed feedback about compensation and benefits and work/ life balance from "ground" staff. Management/ Aministration are wont to capitulate to unreasonable patients; they are spineless. They shoot first and ask later. They don't understand that many patients are plainly unreasonable (typical peasantry mentality) and in the wrong. It's disgusting that they always concede to patients' unreasonable demands even when patients are plainly in the wrong. INEPT NURSES Nurses are brainless lazy complain a lot and always follow the wrong instructions. They can do one task wrongly over and over again. When impeached they will point fingers at their MOs and then each other and give excuses. Actually I can do everything myself; thanks but I don't need their trouble. But I have no time. Some nurses always disappear for hours to smoke and chat. Sometimes they even bring along their managers from the same country! I wonder if Nursing deserves a degree course in NUS when the job needs only ITE caliber (the most miserable level of certification in Singapore). And yet they can mess up so often.
