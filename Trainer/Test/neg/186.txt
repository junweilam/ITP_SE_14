Nonflexible work hours (have to stay on even though work is finished). Typical govermentesque organization with lots of red tapes before being able to implement changes. Managers are generally rigid and inflexible with the majority of them having quite an "oldschool" and traditional method of thinking. Nothing wrong with that but could be slightly stifling for younger staff. Lack of clear career progression and path.
