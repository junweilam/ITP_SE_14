Flexible environment (Depends on the lab you join) Working hours are fixed on paper but as long as you clock your required amount of hours and do your work well no one ever bothers you Very friendly work environment (Depending on which signature programme) I happen to have worked in 2 separate signature programmes and both showed quite vastly different interlab relations. Depending on what you like do ask around how the environment is like. Many talks on current research Every week or 2 there will be a presentation/talk about current research in the respective fields attendance is completely optional so you can attend which ever talk interest you. Helps to give motivation when doing research as well as to provide an avenue for networking.
