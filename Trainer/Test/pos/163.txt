Inclusive relationship and solutions based culture. I had truly learned a lot in my years there. There is a strong sense of mutual respect as each one complements one another. With 11 years of service the culture gets weaved into your blood and spirit which continues to move me. It's been indeed a pleasure to be a part of the team to inculcate effective leadership. My colleagues and work remain in my fondest parts of my memories.
