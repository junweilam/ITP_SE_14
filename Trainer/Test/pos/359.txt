Safety regulations are strict lab equipments are mostly well maintained. The building is maintained very well always in tip top cleanliness even before covid. There appears to be good staff interest activities from time to time. Working hours are flexible. There is a good opportunity for learning if your schedule allows for attendance in seminars. (This is based only on one lab which I'd worked in) Despite the hierarchy most postdocs encourage RAs to participate in project discussions and generally value our skillset. RAs are generally get the opportunity to work independently. The inhouse supply store is rather well stocked. There is a good culture of helping one another out among labs irregardless of being in different departments.
