ASEF offers a unique opportunity to work with multinational colleagues. We have currently have a staff strength of 35 employees from 19 nationalities in Asia and Europe. It's a diverse and enjoyable mix albeit reminiscent of a big dysfunctional family because of different backgrounds mindsets and cultures. ASEF also offers excellent networking opportunities with international partners and counterparts. For people with a nongovernmental background it offers exposure to diplomacy especially if one's role involves dealing with the Board and various Asian and European ministries. In preCOVID times ASEF was best placed to offer travel opportunities to its staff in implementing projects across the 2 continents. In 2018 I travelled to 9 countries. Work then was exhausting yet exhilarating and I believed in the impact of our projects that brought Asians and Europeans together for cultural and intellectual exchange. The good things end there and these positive aspects are not worth enduring the negatives ones (read cons)
