I seldom write reviews but thought of sharing my experiences working for the school. I have been with the company for coming to 10 years started as a junior role and was given opportunities to slowly progress with the school. The school and management gives fair rewards when staff are committed pay rise/job progression are fair and just; so long one is committed to doing your best at the job. When I've family issues the management gave me timeoff on many occasions to attend to my personal matters w/o reprimanding me for the last min urgency for this i am ever grateful . There are many staff here who also works for the school for many years i believe these are the reasons why people stay.
