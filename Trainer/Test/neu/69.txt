It's a huge organization there are so many departments. Every department/team is different. If you report to unreasonable workaholic bosses who expect staff to be the same then you're doomed. But I know of other excolleagues from other departments with good bosses. At least the HR and management seem to value staff's opinion it could partly be because they are very wary of bad press and care a lot about CGH's reputation. I speak from experience. An advice to all who are having a hard time in CGH please speak up and don't suffer alone.
