What has HIMSS Asia Pacific offered to its members and the wider Health IT community in the region? Nothing much other than organising conferences and webinar.s How different are they from a commercial healthcare conference organiser? Nothing much and there are many other better commercial healthcare conferences in the region. Headed by a former Exhibit Manager there is a serious lack of thoughtleadership from HIMSS Asia Pacific. Have you ever hear him speak at healthcare conferences? I guess not and it shows the lack of thought leadership and not fulfilling the mission of HIMSS.
